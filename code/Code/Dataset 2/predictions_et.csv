i have read a lot of discussion about smoking being a factor for develop lung cancer and also not being one and their thought towards it i agree that smoking for the most part is not the wise of idea if your wanting to lead a healthy life i do not agree with the fact that it cause it since i know too many people that have smoke many year and never develop lung cancer i believe that it is cause from a breakdown in the immune system where essential vitamin are lose or need and of course gene that are pas down to we it seem by now that they could detect these gene and also give something to people especially over the age of 50 to strengthen the immune system and make good cell strong to fight the bad cell that spread cancer my mom do develop lung cancer and do smoke so she do fall under that stereotype of lung cancer but there are very many that never have without cigarette my mom would of been miserable in her later day because that is all she have since she wa a widow by 7 year when she past away and they comfort she and relax she and she enjoy it very much by the way she have degenerative bone disease since her early twenty and have always suffer with bone pain for many year she also become diabetic in her 50 so i have to think that just possibly the cancer come from some of those factor since i see a lot of people have diabete and then cancer i have read an article about cancer and it state that cancer cell love sugar so you should really watch your sugar intake i am glad my mom have her cigarette because they were like a good friend to she and she would of been miserable without in her final month so i do not blame she for that at all or the cigarette a i mention too many people who do not smoke or drink develop cancer a my mother in law even do and die at the age of 53 like her father who do not smoke and it wa determined that it wa an aggressive genetic cancer now we have to worry about my husband and our child whom it would not matter what they do because his mom eat very healthy and do not have bad habit i guess my message is that you should do what make you happy and try to limit some of the bad of course but just be comfortable in what you are do because life can be too short to do without and my mom die do what she love and i would not have it any other way and good for she we love you mom i think you should just do what ever make you feel good because in the end it would not matter because what go to happen will happen and that is that it is aggravating but i really am start to believe 100 in that i also do not like the way people who develop lung cancer are treat by some and especially doctor do not blame yourself for this disease just because it is call lung cancer my heart go out to all of you suffer with this disease good luck and good wish for success,positive,positive

hello all gosh it is been a while since i have spend any appreciable amount of time on here and once again i am remind of how much i love and appreciate daily strength early this year i discover a blog write by another young woman who is struggle with prolactinoma she have take a very non standard route in treat it i wa intrigue i know many people will be skeptical but here go anyways she use a combination of different essential oil and certain herb to treat herself she rely primarily on essential oil of frankincense and use other oil to supplement and complement it she also use certain vitamin she is very smart and have do a lot of research into the working behind prolactinoma infertility and the way essential oil work i know most people probably think of the aromatherapy craze about ten year back when they read essential oil but most of that wa just hype nice smell lotion and candle can not really heal your spirit real aromatherapy and real essential oil therapy on the other hand do seem to be back up by a lot of science recently i discover an article about an african doctor who is research the anti cancer property of frankincense essential oil turn out frankincense have very strong anti inflammatory property somehow this make it good at fight tumor i am not familiar with the science behind this bit but i have read in many place that essential oil are effective because the small size of the molecule make they able to pas the blood brain barrier brain cancer is assume uncurable because the chemical use to treat cancer in chemotherapy are not able to do this so obviously i am not a doctor and can not tell you that this will work or that you should try this instead of follow your doctor order and neither can the blog writer in other word the blog is not intend to diagnose or treat disease and neither the blog writer nor i can be hold responsible for your decision but i find it very worth investigate especially since this lady been off her med for a while have finally see her prolactin level drop from the 200s to 6 7 see her blog post on 10 21 see her headache go away her stress level fall and start have her period again check it out http ihaveprolactinoma blogspot com once you start look around you ll find that there is a lot of discussion about what make an essential oil good you can not grab the essential oil down at your grocery store you have to really research the testing and purity of the oil you want to use and make sure your distributor is reliable i am excite i have have a really hard time with my bromocriptine in recent month it seem to have build up in my system or something because i can not even take 2 5 mg in the morning without get dizzy and nauseous to the point of throw up it make i cold and numb and shaky and nervous i hate it and since i am change job soon i am go to lose my health insurance last month i go to a naturopath for the first time it wa a really good experience she listen to i she explain thing to i and she seem to have a comprehensive understanding of all the issue surround this disease she do not just say okay you have this disease take six pill of this per day and report back here in a month she explain how menstruation work how prolactinoma develop accord to doctor speculation and how nursing hormone and stress all play into this i would been take vitex for month but she advise i to stop i guess vitex is a tricky thing to prescribe it may or may not work depend on your individual chemistry just the right amount can help you balance your hormone but too little or too much may throw they off and make your prolactinoma worse anyways i am interested to see what you all think i hope you give the idea a chance and check out her website,positive,positive

hi i am try to figure out how to chose between the two mutually exclusive approach recommend by my doctor 1 have the radiation scan and ablation commonly associate with treat papillary thyroid cancer or 2 do not have it because my tumor wa so small and show no sign of have metastasize detail the total thyroidectomy i have on july 18 2008 reveal a 0 7 cm unifocal tumor papillary carcinoma with no lymphovascular invasion probably extraneous detail here but a multinodular goiter wa also find and one of my parathyroid wa remove possibly le extraneous i am 53 female no previous thyroid cancer in my family to my knowledge but my mother die of breast cancer at 63 and her mother die of liver cancer at 54 i have not been diagnose with any other form of cancer and i am generally in good health the hospital where the surgery wa do have a very advanced nationally recognize program on thyroid cancer the surgical team recommend that because of the tumor small size and apparently unmetastasize state that i not proceed with a radiation scan and ablation the 2006 american thyroid association management guideline appear to i to back up their conclusion my endocrinologist however believe i should proceed with the radiation scan and ablation and have recommend treatment at another hospital which though the program there is head by a doctor with a national reputation in the thyroid cancer field is not a a program a well regard a the one recommend against scan ablation i have see the endocrinologist all of twice in my life when ultrasound and fine needle aspiration point to the need for surgery she refer i to a general surgeon emphasize the convenience of his location location is again her selling point for the program she have recommend to do the scan ablation really their location are no more convenient than the hospital with the nationally recognize program but location strike i a a big so what in this situation in any event when my internist learn of the recommendation that i see a general surgeon she flatly tell i to go to the nationally recognize program where a surgeon who specialize in thyroidectomy would do the procedure that make sense to i so i do not go to the general surgeon my endocrinologist recommend the surgeon i do go to wa awesomely good the follow up care do in her absence vacation have been pretty poor however which leave i a little wary of the advice i am get there though a i say the ata guideline appear to back it up at the same time i do not know whether my endocrinologist is base her current recommendation of proceed with the scan ablation on a professional conclusion that the management guideline are not sound or should not be apply to i in particular or just base her position on outdate information or practice on my own i can see pro and con to both approach the scan ablation would reduce my chance of still have a lurk cancer however small those chance are and make monitor le difficult and perhaps even free i from the monitoring process after a few year at the same time the prep for the procedure is not a lark and i have speak with survivor who many year after the procedure are suffer from some pretty significant side effect particularly damage to their salivary gland and are still undergo monitoring just a if they have not go through with the scan and ablation i suppose when the nuclear medicine specialist i have been refer to by my endocrinologist review my record the one with the convenient location he may conclude the same thing a the practitioner at the hospital where my surgery wa do i would take that a a clear no scan no ablation decision if he think i should proceed however i am leave with the mix of opinion i have now this is not likely to be a life or death decision whatever i choose to do but i feel stymie one thing i am wonder is whether there are simply two group of practitioner one that always proceed with scan ablation regardless of staging and one that do not proceed with it when the cancer is at the stage mine wa at if so the decision is really up to i since whomever else i turn to for advice will offer his or her group standard position and i could create a majority opinion simply by choose a member of one group or the other knowingly or not any thought on how i can figure all this out and go forward with confidence that i am do the wise thing thank very much for read all of this and for contribute your idea,neutral,neutral

a battle worth fight the heavy old wooden front door of the old brick ranch house groan a it wa violently fling open i immediately feel the sticky hot humid outside air hit a soon a i put one foot outside the door the sun wa just begin to set create a sky dust with blue and pink beauty in the midst of pain i gasp at the outside air i wa become to feel trap inside of the crowd house and have to get out one unsure footstep at a time i make my way down the black asphalt semi circle front driveway dodge the prickly gumball speckle the way a centerpiece of the front yard the giant old sweet gum tree never fail at leave massive amount of gumball everywhere the burn asphalt scorch my bare foot with each step make yet too much wa go on in my head to notice the burning feel the far away i walk from my lifelong house the le control i have over my direction at the end of the driveway a jolt come across my whole body and my leg swing into a sprint lead the way down the hilly street my long dirty blonde hair whip against my back a i fly down from the top of the hill clutch at my rhinestone cover flip phone in one hand a last lifeline to reality one i wa not yet ready to utilize my leg keep on move like wheel on a bike and at the end of the road i take a sharp turn i stealthily make my way across a neighbor lawn sprint through thick green grass still wet from the sprinkler eventually i make my way onto a run trail and slow down a bit heart still pump at a swift rate in my chest tall ancient oak tree line the trail provide a sense of escape from the outside world a seemingly never end pale concrete path weave through the tree create a winding trail i could not help but feel the urge to follow the shady patch wa a familiar peaceful place that i love to go bike riding along a a child no one else wa around and the only sound were that of the neighborhood street nearby and hidden bird chirp in the tree i wish i could just stay there for forever leave the awful unfold reality behind i wa do what i feel the most comfortable to do and what i have been do throughout the past year run away from my problem my leg come to a slow walk a i gasp for air try my good to block any thought out of my head i wonder how long i could stay go without anyone in the house noticing i look down at the phone in my hand and take a deep breath punch the number into the light key i begin to shake and know there wa no turn back now the second the word come out of my mouth i know there wa no more pretend thing were okay and it wa official i could no long fake that my family wa perfectly normal the game of make believe wa do a the voice on the other end answer i open my mouth and in a scared shaky voice declare it over it can be seemly hard to realize exactly how many advancement have been make in medicine over the year until you compare the past to the present a recent phone conversation with my 90 year old grandfather put modern cancer medicine into perspective for i ben bronson wa only 15 year old back in 1935 when his old sister fall ill the doctor at the time were only able to diagnosis his sister with suffer from a tumor in her colon this diagnosis at the time wa ultimately write off a a fatal one with no treatment in sight what the doctor were not aware of at the time though wa anything about what exactly cancer wa or way to treat cancer research and technology have not come that far yet and those suffer from what today is now know a cancer have little to no chance of survival today what his sister ultimately lose her life over would be consider colon cancer and while now there are treatment option a complete cure is still yet to be reach in may 1940 time magazine report that since 1900 over 3 and a half million people in the you s have suffer from cancer and most of the people suffer ultimately die from the disease divide 3 and half million by the 40 year there wa an average of 87 500 people suffer from cancer each year the time magazine article go on to call cancer the great of all hazard of live and it will probably always remain in this position of importance and may even become much more prominent a a cause of death while in 1940 87 500 people suffer from cancer each year seem a surmountable number today in 2010 newsweek sharon begley report that cancer is project to kill 569 400 this year alone these number are basically state that even with large leap in medical advancement more people then ever are die from the disease statistic like these can be entirely disparage and leave lot of question one of the question i know i continue to ask myself to this day is where do all the money go that is give to fund cancer research and why are all of these fund not produce significant result and lower the number of people suffer while these number project that cancer is in a bad position then it wa back in 1940 there is still hope on the horizon normal sixteen year old do not really have any significant worry in their life and nothing too press that is on their mind average sixteen year old are count down the day eager to get their driver license and cringe in jealously every time a friend is able to get their license before they they yearn to be with their friend every second of the day and frown at the idea of have to spend time with their family family time become unimportant in the eye of a teenager something they are only willing to do when force the most important thing in the eye of a sixteen year old are being like and try new thing life have not yet become serious in the eye of a sixteen year old and there are few real worry year sixteen wa different for i though it wa the year i wa deal a hard hand in the game of life and through force learn the importance of family i experience great disappointment in modern medicine and learn first hand how short life can really be a giant earthquake in the middle of an unsuspecting town it wa harsh and it change everything sun pour through the large full length window fill the room with the warmth that can only come from a mid west summer the brick ranch house wa quiet and the bird chirp on the bird feeder outside the window could be clearly hear a large oak tree sway in the wind on the patio and the orange tabby cat lay by the full length window memorize by the bird it wa the end of summer and i wa leave grasp at the stand lay on the giant sectional family room couch i make an effort to change the channel a soon a a back to school commercial come on i hate being home the house and my family wa painfully boring and all i could think about wa how great it would be once i get my license and could go where ever i want when ever i want to the phone begin to ring yet i ignore it my friend never call the home phone and so to i there wa no point in bother to answer it suddenly scream disrupt the sleepy house pierce cry of distress that make my ear ache and my stomach twist i jolt out of my lazy relaxed state on the couch and zone in the source of the noise enter in the kitchen i come upon my mother sit at the kitchen table red face and teary eye so this is pretty much a death sentence she yell into the white cordless phone head hold low and leg shake she looked scarily defeat the anger in her voice send chill through my body immediately my mind shoot back to a few day ago i wa lie in her bed and she stand in front of a wall mirror complaining of stomach pain she tell i she have a bad feeling about it and wa go to the doctor soon to get it check out i do not have to listen to anything else she wa scream into the phone i know what wa go on cringe a my stomach begin to turn i feel freeze in that moment finally i wa able to move and slowly back out of the kitchen i have a sense that it wa good just to give my mother some space at the time i rush to my room and close the door stay out of the way seem to be the good thing to do in the beginning of the summer of 2001 my mother have survive cancer without even know it until the very end the doctor swear the constant stomach pain she suffer from were just constipation and nothing serious to worry about even after persistent visit to the doctor office they swear it could be nothing terrible after all she wa only 42 and people that age rarely get cancer they reason quickly the pain become unbearable though and a late night rush to the emergency room prove the doctor diagnosis to be terribly wrong the stomach pain that have start out dull and rise to an intense stabbing pain wa not something trivial such a constipation but in fact colon cancer and my mother wa on the verge of death an emergency surgery to remove a tumor in my mother colon and the luck of get one of the good surgeon in the midwest save her life the news shock all the doctor who would have never guess the stomach pain wa in fact cancer the doctor go on to promise that they get all of the cancer out in surgery and chemotherapy wa not even truly necessary my mother though want to make sure and opt to go through month of painful chemotherapy just in case the just in case month of endured chemotherapy prove to not be enough though and the disease make it way back to my mother body in 2004 there at the kitchen table my mother sit take in the awful news this time wa much bad though and the news wa not only bad but also extremely grim not only have the colon cancer come back to invade her body but it have also metastasize into her liver the national cancer institute explain that metastasis is when cancer cell spread from one part of the body to another form a new tumor in a different organ while metastatic cancer do not always have symptom my mother become to experience pain in her stomach and just have a gut feeling that something wa wrong inside the feeling lead she to the doctor and soon the doctor become the bearer of bad news the mid afternoon call from the oncologist reaffirm not only my mother deepest fear but my whole family with the diagnosis of more cancer come another full on battle only this time hope wa outnumber with painful reality one by one the troop came rush in for battle a i stay on the sideline watch the reality that set my mother into scream that summer day wa that liver cancer have a low survival rate to begin with and metastatic liver cancer have an even low survival rate accord to cancersurvivalrate com the overall worldwide survival rate for liver cancer is 7 five year after initial diagnosis the diagnosis give to my mother wa even more grim though and even with treatment the doctor predict she would not survive any long than a year my mother wa a fighter though and after swallow a hard pill of bone shake news she gear up for the fierce battle ahead even know how painful go through chemo wa she wa willing to go through it again i hear tale of the burn feeling that hit a soon a the chemo make it way into your vein and just see my mother agree to go through such a thing without much hope wa awe inspire the month that follow the terrible news turn chilly and dark quick then i could have ever imagine winter come in full force storm rumble the door and rattle the hall round and round of chemotherapy slowly begin to suck the life out of my mother weakness strike a hard a expect and soon even simple thing such a get up to get a glass of water become difficult home time become an exhausting time balance take care of myself with help my mother out medcinenet com state that the side effect from chemotherapy include fatigue pain nausea and vomit along with a whole list of effect on other part of the body while my mother suffer all of these side effect to the full the one noticeable common side effect people normally associate chemo with she never suffer from this side effect is most noticeable due to it affect outward appearance and is hair loss even after continual chemotherapy my mother thick long blonde hair wa stubborn and refuse to come out chemocare com report that hair loss do not occur with all chemotherapy and that chemotherapy affect each person differently this fact make it seem from an outsider point of view that she wa not very sick at all no hair loss also make it easy for i to hide from my friend the truth i do not want any sympathy or for my family to appear a thought it wa not normal or that it wa fall apart it may seem strange to some but even pretend there wa an ounce of normalcy leave wa well then let the truth hang out after several week of chemo the result were back on the effectiveness of the treatment and the news wa nothing but sicken my whole family have hope and pray for the good but it wa just not enough not only have the chemo fail to shrink my mother tumor in her liver but the cancer have start to spread through out her body before i know it family from out of town begin show up at our door and our house wa under invasion from the unfamiliar everywhere i look wa some relative try to help clean house or cook dinner my grandmother wa suddenly live with we sit at the kitchen table to greet i everyday after i come home for school thing go back to normal seem nothing more then a fantasy to i and i wish hard that the fantasy could come true i hate the intruder and my solution wa to spend a much time a possible away from home i want my family to be normal again and i want all the people crowd out every corner to leave the sicker my mother become the more faith i lose in the doctor and modern medicine i could not understand how the doctor were not able to get her disease under control and how they were fail at the fight every new trial drug bring new hope hope that wa quickly destroy by reality all the medicine continue fail at the fight and turn into disappointment after disappointment it become almost impossible to pretend like nothing wa wrong anymore even trial treatment seem to fail to work and soon the cancer have spread to the bottom of her lung at the time i just could not understand how none of the treatment work in combat the cancer and become angry in a way the new york time recently run an article by gina kolata that say 105 billion have been spend on the fight against cancer since 1971 when richard nixon officially declare war on the disease even with all the money spend on research though the disease have continue to keep a steady death rate with only a small drop in number over the year one reason the article state that the battle against cancer have not make much progress is because the grant system use to fund cancer research have become a job program and le of a way to actually make ground break discovery research laboratory lean towards play it safe and spend their time work on small project which are unlikely to lead to a cure for cancer project that could possibly make a difference in cancer treatment or progress towards a cure for cancer are often rule out because of the uncertainty that follow they hear news like this is not only incredibly dishearten but also painful to hear that not everything is being do that could be do to combat cancer patient are suffer family are suffer and society a a whole is ache for a major cancer advancement a a last hope my mother wa give incredibly strong chemo and my whole family cross their finger not until this point do my mother truly start to look sick and fragile her full head of hair finally give out and slowly but surely start to fall out she try to cope with the hair loss but it wa evident she wa becoming defeat her thick blonde hair wa her trademark and an asset she gain compliment through her entire life unable to stand up against the harsh drug her hair leave and scarf were a measly replacement weakness spread throughout her body and soon even eat become a hard task quickly weight begin to drop off she it wa at a shocking rate and incredibly hard to watch before i know it everyday become a struggle to try and get my mother to eat more it come to the point that i would sit next to she in bed beg she just to take another bite of food think that just maybe it would help my father would be send on trip all across town get her favorite food pain tear throughout my mother body and she become so thin that you could actually see the tumor in her liver protrude out from her stomach it wa a ghastly site to see and at time it almost feel a though i wa look at the living dead while it would have make sense to want to spend a much time a possible home with my mother i ache to be out with my friend spend the night over at friend house entire weekend i spend more time then ever away from home relish the fact that i have my license and wa able to get away whenever it feel strange in a way that finally when i wa able to drive my mother wa no long able to the cancer drug were impair and not safe to drive while take there i wa take over her car and every once in a while i feel that i wa take over a role that i wa much to young to handle my two brother and i were sit down at the breakfast room at the white table it seem eerily formal and force i look out the large bay window at the road and refuse to acknowledge anything around i i do not want to hear what the strange lady sit across from we have to say i want to get up and leave i do not need some stranger tell i what wa go on in my life i could feel it and see it with my own eye my parent think by not tell i everything it would be well but they do not have to because i already know i become a master at eavesdropping and everything they hesitate to tell i find out on my own the lady sit across from i at the table that day wa from hospice hospicenet org explain that hospice emphasize palliative rather than curative treatment quality rather than quantity of life hospice come in when someone have a limited life expectancy to aide the person in pain control and comfort a a sixteen year old though i do not see any positive all i see wa that my mom wa give up on the fight at that moment my heart break and i suffer through the pain listen to this person explain their presence i want they out i want they to stop read this child book to i about a young child parent die from cancer in their home and to let i get about my day i could not comprehend how she could just give up how could she not fight until the very end instead of leave the people multiply in strong force like a virus you just can not shake i spend my time try my good to ignore their existence and when that wa not possible i just stay away from home in my mind i know i should be spend time with my mother while i could but my heart could not bear to be inside the house with the many invader there wa hospice care giver there wa nurse there wa iv and i could not bear to be around any of it my faith in medicine wa go and i could not believe that in modern day there truly wa no cure everyone wa just sit around wait for the last breath to be take in the last two month of my mother life she begin to wither away look more skeletal and le like my mother she wa slowly slip away in front of my eye and there wa nothing i could do to stop it at time she would say thing do not make any sense at all and i wa terrify i want to freeze time and then rewind to back when my family wa normal and she wa healthy she wa on a constant morphine drip and nurse were always at the house life become full of medical supply and pill bottle galore yet everyday she get bad and bad it wa painfully hard to watch and i make the decision to leave for the summer once again the cold weather have pas and life come back to the plant and i could not bear to stay in my house with the intruder any long so away i go off to the country ranch like i do every summer only this time it wa more run away then enjoy summer break at the ranch life seem normal once again and just what i need in order to breathe take care of horse bring solitude to my storm and everything go on back home become a distant memory that wa at least until the day my father show up at the ranch i wa in the dusty stable and i see he walk towards out the corner of my eye and i just know the time have come and i wa whisk away from my wonderland and back to a depressing reality modern medicine fail to win the fight and i begin to lose hope in it power i timidly push the wrought iron gate open and make my way inside the thick white snow sink down at each step my boot clothe foot make my footprint leave a trail the harsh cold wind whip through the air and i shiver a i make my way along the path i find my target and i take a seat right in the icy snow snow cover the fresh flower lay in front of the stone a surprising sight to see after six year and undoubte the work of my father i think for a moment if this outcome would be the same today year later hope that at least there would be something more to add to the fight today ring through my head though i wa not so sure that any more progress have actually been make friend and family come after the end and donate thousand of dollar to cancer research one could only hope that the money have actually been put to work and not use just to fund some unimportant project sit there wa a look into the depth and proof now more then ever society need a cure child should never have to lose a parent to such a horrible disease human life is at great risk and for the sustainability of life to continue we can no long afford not to take risk in research after all you you too could be next up to fight the great fight,positive,positive

hi for anyone worried about liver biopsy to measure iron concentration potential complication there is new software that can do this use a non invasive mri scan the company is call ferriscan i think the mri can be do anywhere and then they analyse the scan for iron measurement not sure about cost and so on a they are a private company but worth look at or ask your doctor about if you do not want to have the biopsy i work in a radiology department and have only just hear of this but this should completely remove the need for biopsy to measure iron concentration once the mri technique is in common use,neutral,neutral

i have read a lot of discussion about smoking being a factor for develop lung cancer and also not being one and their thought towards it i agree that smoking for the most part is not the wise of idea if your wanting to lead a healthy life i do not agree with the fact that it cause it since i know too many people that have smoke many year and never develop lung cancer i believe that it is cause from a breakdown in the immune system where essential vitamin are lose or need and of course gene that are pas down to we it seem by now that they could detect these gene and also give something to people especially over the age of 50 to strengthen the immune system and make good cell strong to fight the bad cell that spread cancer my mom do develop lung cancer and do smoke so she do fall under that stereotype of lung cancer but there are very many that never have without cigarette my mom would of been miserable in her later day because that is all she have since she wa a widow by 7 year when she past away and they comfort she and relax she and she enjoy it very much by the way she have degenerative bone disease since her early twenty and have always suffer with bone pain for many year she also become diabetic in her 50 so i have to think that just possibly the cancer come from some of those factor since i see a lot of people have diabete and then cancer i have read an article about cancer and it state that cancer cell love sugar so you should really watch your sugar intake i am glad my mom have her cigarette because they were like a good friend to she and she would of been miserable without in her final month so i do not blame she for that at all or the cigarette a i mention too many people who do not smoke or drink develop cancer a my mother in law even do and die at the age of 53 like her father who do not smoke and it wa determined that it wa an aggressive genetic cancer now we have to worry about my husband and our child whom it would not matter what they do because his mom eat very healthy and do not have bad habit i guess my message is that you should do what make you happy and try to limit some of the bad of course but just be comfortable in what you are do because life can be too short to do without and my mom die do what she love and i would not have it any other way and good for she we love you mom i think you should just do what ever make you feel good because in the end it would not matter because what go to happen will happen and that is that it is aggravating but i really am start to believe 100 in that i also do not like the way people who develop lung cancer are treat by some and especially doctor do not blame yourself for this disease just because it is call lung cancer my heart go out to all of you suffer with this disease good luck and good wish for success,positive,positive

i see a movie call a beautiful truth it make the claim that a doctor dr gerson in the 1920s find a cure for cancer diabete and teburcalosus the remedy is a strict diet of only organic fruit and vegetable juice buy the produce and juice it yourself 8 ounce every wake hour and organic coffee enema twice a day the film say the coffee stimulate a nerve in the colon that is associate with the liver the stimulation cause the liver to produce bile and other chemical that clean the blood it is very important that the food be organic and raw the movie say that the gmo pesticide fertilizer and so on tax the immune system so in addiction to the liver deal with hcv it also have to heal with the poison from inorganic food if you do it you ll probably be spend at least 30 a day on produce in do some research i find a site about the gerson therapy that say someone who wa about to die from hep b in the 1970 wa cure with this diet i do not know the reliability of this site but it is hopeful the main topic of the film wa cancer but since hep c can develop into liver cancer and the fda treatment is cancer med i think this diet is certainly worth try,neutral,neutral

i go to a rectal doctor on monday for a concern i have that turn out to be nothing but in talk with he about colonoscopy we realize we have a problem or rather i do and i am not sure what to do about it i am on coumadin blood thin for a clotting disorder have been for 25 year and have a virtual colonoscopy last year so i would not have to go off of it well in talk with the colon doctor monday i say i really want to have a regular one next time and say i wa aware i would have to go off the coumadin 3 4 day beforehand no big deal i have have two minor surgurie in the past and have to stop it then too i just go back on it immediately afterwards my alarm wa evident though when he say and if i remove any polyp i will have to keep you off of it for about 10 day because of the bleeding i am sure the color drain from my face and i say i can not do that he explain that he have other patient who are on it and say that of course he have to take they off of it if he do surgery he have no choice but my belief is if he is do colon surgery on these people chance are they are also old if they are on a blood thin and many of they are probably take it for heart condition not a clotting disorder my chance of get a clot while off of it is very scary to i and i am just completely lose a to what to do i really do not give it alot of thought at first a i wa just relieve to find out my original problem wa nothing but the more i think about it the more concerned i become a eventually i am go to have to decide what to do my question is have anyone else on here have a similar problem and if so what do you do i think if i wa young i probably would not worry a much about being off of it but because i am a little old now 52 chance of stroke and the like start become a little risky a it do for everybody when they age i know i can talk with my blood doctor but what i am ask all of you is if anyone else have have a similar problem and how you deal with it thank so much,negative,negative

involuntary smoking or passive smoke non smoker who breathe in secondhand smoke take in nicotine and other toxic chemical just like smoker do the more secondhand smoke you are expose to the high the

expose to secondhand smoke are also at increase risk of have low birth weight baby secondhand smoke may be link to breast cancer whether secondhand smoke increase the risk of breast cancer is an issue that is still being study both mainstream and secondhand smoke contain about 20 chemical that in high concentration cause breast cancer in rodent and we know that in human chemical from tobacco smoke reach breast tissue and are find in breast milk but a link between secondhand smoke and breast cancer risk in human study is still being debate this is partly because breast cancer risk have not been show to be increase in active smoker one possible explanation for this is that tobacco smoke may have different effect on breast cancer risk in smoker and in those who are expose to secondhand smoke a report from the california environmental protection agency in 2005 conclude that the evidence regard secondhand smoke and breast cancer is consistent with a causal association in young woman this mean that the secondhand smoke act a if it could be a cause of breast cancer in these woman the 2006 u surgeon general report the health consequence of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke find that there is suggestive but not sufficient evidence of a link at this point in any case woman should be tell that this possible link to breast cancer is yet another reason to avoid being around secondhand smoke secondhand smoke kill child and adult who do not smoke and make other sick surgeon general report the 2006 u surgeon general report reach some important conclusion secondhand smoke cause premature death and disease in child and in adult who do not smoke child expose to secondhand smoke are at an increase risk of sudden infant death syndrome sid acute respiratory infection ear problem and more severe asthma smoking by parent cause breathe respiratory symptom and slow lung growth in their child secondhand smoke immediately affect the heart and blood circulation in a harmful way over a long time it also cause heart disease and lung cancer the scientific evidence show that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke many million of american both child and adult are still expose to secondhand smoke in their home and workplace despite a great deal of progress in tobacco control the only way to fully protect non smoker from exposure to secondhand smoke indoor is to prevent all smoking in that indoor space or building separate smoker from non smoker clean the air and ventilate building can not keep non smoker from being expose to secondhand smoke where is secondhand smoke a problem you should be especially concerned about exposure to secondhand smoke in these 4 place at work the workplace is a major source of secondhand smoke exposure for adult secondhand smoke meet the standard to be classify a a potential cancer cause agent by the occupational safety and health administration osha the federal agency responsible for health and safety regulation in the workplace the

safe level they recommend that exposure to secondhand smoke be reduce to the low possible level secondhand smoke in the workplace have been link to an increase risk for heart disease and lung cancer among adult non smoker the surgeon general have say that smoke free workplace policy are the only way to do away with secondhand smoke exposure at work separate smoker from non smoker clean the air and ventilate the building can not prevent exposure if people still smoke inside the building an extra bonus other than protect non smoker is that workplace smoking restriction may also encourage smoker to quit in public place everyone can be expose to secondhand smoke in public place such a restaurant shopping center public transportation school and daycare center some business seem to be afraid to ban smoking but there is no proof that go smoke free is bad for business public place where child go are a special area of concern at home make your home smoke free may be one of the most

lately i often see tiny amount of bright red blood on my stool and sometimes on the toilet tissue i read on the net that the most possible cause is a hemorrhoid i am also aware it can be something more serious my question here is mainly about a hemorrhoid though i have a colonoscopy do about 5 5 year ago i remember at that time the gi specialist say he find a hemorrhoid but i can not remember whether he say he remove it or not so if a gi specialist find a hemorrhoid during a colonoscopy do he usually remove it or not now let we assume that the gi specialist have already remove that hemorrhoid 5 5 year ago is it likely that now i have again another hemorrhoid which cause the bright red blood usually how long do it take for someone to have a hemorrhoid develop is 5 5 year too short to have another hemorrhoid sorry for so many question i will deeply appreciate your reply,neutral,neutral

hello everyone i sign up a a member here a few month ago but never really post i always have been more of a reader than writer pretty much any question or concern i ever have i could find info for and i have get so much help just read but i have come to a point that i sure could use a little more personal encouragement understanding and lot and lot of prayer here is a brief i hope summary of my past 10 month i wa diagnose with aml august 4 2015 i wa 65 at the time now 66 my health record show diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia with presence of erythroid hyperplasia 25 blast of all non erythroid cell normal female karyotype aml fish panel is negative molecular test show positive cebpa negative npm1 and flt3 i wa tell that i fall into the intermediate range some good marker and some not so good i receive the 7 3 protocol of cytarabine and idarubicin for induction and except for body rash from allergy to one of the med and mouth and throat problem i do very well do not really feel sick and never vomitte i wa only in the hospital for 17 day because i do so well my blood count bounce back within 3 week then i go back to the hospital for 5 day to start the first cycle of consolidation i have a total of 4 consolidation which end 1 11 2016 and i handle they with no real problem to speak of thank god a possible bmt sct wa mention by my doctor pretty early on she want i to go to scca seattle cancer care alliance for a consultation but at that time i decline and tell she i do not want a transplant just chemo only pray all the time that i would not relapse even though i have been feel so great these past month and all throughout my treatment with just being a little tired between chemos when my count go down and feel so positive strong well than i have feel in year even year before diagnosis ready to climb a mountain this summer when we go camp i recently get the news that i relapse they find a few blast in my peripheral blood and after a biopsy they find 1 to 2 blast in my bone marrow i know could still be consider remission if under 5 but the doctor say no doubt of relapse and they go by last chemo for count remission in january so that just make i in remission for 3 month which is not good for salvage chemo alone so i finally agree to go to scca for a consultation and here are my 3 choice 1 i can do nothing more and have approximately 1 year nobody but god really know 2 i can do salvage chemo only which they give i a 15 chance of long remission 3 i can do chemo tbi and a transplant lot of protocol to choose from here give i a 35 to 40 chance of long remission i have almost decide on transplant the tbi and gvhd and all the risk are weigh heavily on my mind i have such good quality of life at this point i sure hate to loose it possibly for good in a way i would like to just try the salvage chemo alone have it do at the seattle cancer center since they have access to the late and great drug that are still in the process of being approve by the fda but they are able to use they and they are have very good success with i could be one of the 15 to make it to long remission but if i do that my chance go down if i relapse again and i am not sure a transplant would be in the picture then if i wa much young i would go straight to transplant but at my age i really do not know what s good for i i know none of you can tell i what to do this is my choice alone i am just look for encouragement and prayer and whatever i decide in the near future to have a place to go where people understand what i am go through nobody can know unless they have been through it i know this is long and thank you to whoever read it it actually help to write it out i would welcome your thought good wish and prayer to everyone karen,positive,positive

i have never post anything here before but i have often come here to read post and i would like to thank all of you for share your story a they have help i and my family alot i hope that i can bring some hope to all of you my father have nsclc that have spread all over his lung and to the adjacent lymph node numerous chemotherapy help to shrink the tumor but eventually stop work in decemberhe wa put on iressa a a step to merely prolong his life it work great and not only stop the cancer from grow but considerably shrink the tumour along side this he wa also take a number of chinese herbal combination to boost his immune system eventually the iressa stop shrink the tumour and just prevent their growth this wa good enough for we slowly my father start develop some tingle sensation in his leg and foot and have back pain he wa check out and they find a mass of inflammation in his spine the doctor initially think it to be cancer because they do not know what else it could be they decide to radiate the mass and this mean that for three week my father would have to go off of iressa i have do some internet research and find an herbal remedy for cancer call essiac tea i think that we would get he drink it 4 oz twice a day while he wa on radiation because it wa know to be excellent for deal with the side effect of cancer treatment after 3 week the doctor decide to take an x ray of his lung to see how badly the cancer have grow while he wa off the iressa they say not to worry to much a any new growth would be handle by the iressa to everyone surprise the x ray reveal that my father lung were completely clean the are plan still to do a ct scan to double check but nobody can believe what they see on the x ray i do not know if it wa the tea but i do not know what else it could have been the radiation wa point at his throat area not his lung take home message 1 do not believe everything your oncologist tell you a year ago they tell he that he have 2 month to live do your own research and try everything you can the doctor now are say they do not know what s in his spine and the radiation have make it bad if anybody have ever hear of any spine disorder let i know we are still try to understand what this is so while we are happy the cancer is go in his lung we have a new le scary problem to face 2 prayer is important i do not have the space here to discus all the particular but god will guide you to any answer if you ask he to do not concern yourself with which religion to follow they are just tool to uncover god they are not god themselves is the cancer the choice of the god above you or the god within you everything have it purpose when you figure out what that is you will move on take time to expand your mind and enlighten yourself to infinite possibility and understand 3 herbal and natural remedy do work try to find an experienced herbalist to examine you and give you the proper herb give essiac tea a shot it might work for you too i know how hard this can be but do not lose faith my prayer are with you,positive,positive

snore especially when he is try to sleep so i go to an ear nose throat ent doctor and i wa diagnose with gerd and put on omeprazole 20 mg per day in 2012 mind you the omeprazole help with the pain of heartburn but i still have all the rest i keep talk to my dr about the puffiness my test always come back okay except that my inflammation marker were always elevate i have have 3 different primary physician over 10 year and it wa never address thoroughly i keep ask should not we find out why is not this an indication i have colonoscopy perfect endoscopy some minor glitch but nothing crazy fast forward a full ten year later last friday october 15 at 6 30am i wake up with the bad stomach pain bf wa at work already my first thought wa bowel blockage again and i try to remedy that no luck i sit down pain stand up pain walk it off pain lie down pain lefty side right side pain pain for some dumb reason i wait until 8 40am to call 911 and go to hospital by ambulance they give i morphine for the pain draw so much blood for lab work do ultrasound find nothing unusual except yet and still elevate inflammation marker my stat were all over the place spo2 88 at it bad blood pressure high 179 over something to 84 52 pulse low i see wa 45 temp wa normal although i keep sweat i start throw up but i wa not very hungry the past couple week and wa not eat much so it wa mostly bile it wa alarming to i at one point though when the bile come out foamy and a lot i will ask the dr about that my body wa spin out and they could not find anything wrong they do not seem to know how to proceed or help i besides narcotic nothing i eat the day before wa suspect i have no major lead in symptom clue to this seemingly sudden attack i wa in the er until like 9 pm and they move i to a room i wa take to my room the next morning dizzy with all the narcotic yet still in pain more blood test urine another ultrasound they even do a ct scan fine fine fine fine around 11 am saturday morning the doctor come in and ask i to sign 2 consent form for surgery at 7 pm one for endoscopy and if that do not show cause then they would take out my gallbladder huh what s that i mean i have hear of it of course but what s that get to do with my stomach whatever i sign the consent form when i wake up everything wa calm i feel well my stat were back to normal i sleep the doctor come in maybe 3 am who know time is irrelevant with so much fentanyl he say he remove my gallbladder it wa gangrenous veddy veddy bad he keep say rotten dead black the attend nurse mention to i how bad it wa every time she check on i also the infection bacteria have get into my blood i wa veddy veddy sick i could have die wth my gallbladder never show up in ultrasound a suspicious at all not even in er no gallstone cyst enlargement nothing it wa a shot in the dark for he to go that route but what a good call oh my god and it wa go bad for year from my first gerd diagnosis i have been live without it is function for who know how long nobody ever mention it a possibly being the cause of anything the surgical removal of the gallbladder is call cholecystectomy koh luh si tek tuh i mine wa able to be do by laparoscopy though i agree to full incision if necessary i have 4 hole hold close by adhesive steri strip right now no stitch or staple i can shower i wa in the hospital 5 day home in bed with antibiotic and pain med 3 day bf a i today 12 day later a i write this i feel like a million buck all that inflammation is go after so many year the puffy face finger and toe now normal my eczema clear up my stuffy sinus gerd post nasal drip swollen neck and throat all normal even my tortuous tinnitus is well not completely but noticeably calm i am even think i can wean off the omeprazole finally well see so my message to you all is consider the gallbladder a a culprit push your doctor to check it if you re at the end of your rope do not just keep go for all the home remedy and supplement while still suffer the doctor can test and tell what vitamin you are lack it do not help to flood your body without a reference base on something you read online even if the suffering is not severe but you have multiple symptom the gallbladder must be a consideration there is only one way for they to check it and that is through a mild but surgical procedure which is probably why they never check but they must get their eye on it the procedure not sure the name of it should be perform on everyone in my opinion what they do is put you to sleep then fill your stomach with gas and make like an opera house then with camera light and so on they can go in and check all or most of your organ gallbladder spleen liver pancrea outer area of stomach bowel diaphragm right kidney maybe leave too not sure these were all mention in my paperwork there is so many thing that can only be detect diagnose and treat this way and this way only that is my story let i just add this side story dec 14 2020 my athletic healthy father in law notice blood in his urine other than chronic back pain it wa his first sign something wa wrong he go to the doctor he have undetecte liver cancer which metastasize to his bladder only when the bladder show it symptom then do they look he die 10 day later on the 24th the day before christmas have they do this procedure they would have see the silent killer and maybe been able to treat it why is not it a priority they check everything else anyway consider it push for it get it check,neutral,negative

hi everybody i just want to say that accord to scientific research more then half of people who have hep c never develop liver cirrhosis or cancer of cause if you have a certain life style like no drinking or smoke healthy diet and if you do not have other health problem they say if you make it to 60 with hep c most likely you will die from something else it do not apply to everyone though again of cause it is well to get rid off it and start treatment no doubt but i think we scare all these young people on this site let we be more positive and optimistic especially because we can see clearly on this site that it have more success story then the other way around a i say million of people live with it happily cause they do not know they have it and only 1 5 develop cirrhosis or liver cancer again hip c is not sickness it just a condition in which the patient might develop cirrhosis or liver cancer i wish everybody to believe in yourself and believe in new triple medicine and new light med is come out soon hep c is treatable now we live in a different world cheer up,positive,positive

well my my i actually get to see the man yesterday in vega the first thing he tell i god is he smart and his mind move with lightning speed after palpate my liver is that i do not have cirrhosis my gi here tell i i do what a relief dr gish say my liver do not feel at all cirrhotic plus the ct scan and ultrasound show normal size spleen and liver and my lab tell he a lot a well so do the bx report gee he could actually decipher it without see the bx slide yet he make an educate guess which i would say is quite educate base on all the datum he wa process like a 50000 gb computer it wa amazing to watch he and listen to he talk out loud about all of it of stage 2 8 fibrosis he tell i my option do nothing and my liver would last another 10 12 year wait for the new all oral that will be out in a couple year and if anyone know that it is he or start tx now my choice let we roll i will be do victreli which can be up to 66 svr i guess the reason for that choice of pi and thank god it will be vic is that i am treatment naive plus he think the fat requirement and side of incivek would be way too much for i to deal with age and weight and so on if i am not undie by week 12 tx stop but i can then do the all oral when they come out i see his associate dr martinez on august 30 get exact result of my stage base on the bx slide that his staff is order and will analyze dr gish do give i a disclaimer that his 2 8 might change base on the bx slide and from there we start move on this monster lock and load scan the perimeter well that will have already been do get psyche up for battle and move out i have to take a class of course on slam the riba and side and so on so i should be treat by the end of september something interesting i mention that liver ache i have been experience off and on for four year and tell he that it wa my understanding from doctor that the liver have no nerve ending so could not feel pain and if my organ are not enlarge which would press against the capsule around the liver what is go on his response wa priceless he say that doctor should read the merck manual laugh out loud that the liver do have nerve ending not a lot but some so that pain and ache is because i have hep c most do not feel it but it is not a big deal and to just take tylenol extra strength a need i think that this is an important thing for people to know because there is so much bad information out there about this so all in all i am very relieved very very blessed to be under the care of dr gish and i feel for the first time in 3 month and more if you add in the liver pain ache i can relax a bit i will be need advice and support when the tx start and i know i will find that here you guy are just the good xoxoxoxoxoxxoxoxo meowwwwwwwwwwwww,positive,positive

to the lung people who experience dyspnea describe it a difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath they often compare it to feel like they are suffocate or being smother in many case patient may develop anxiety or panic if they feel they can not breathe often their anxiety and fear can make the dyspnea bad by panic patient can become more breathless and begin a cycle that is hard to stop dyspnea occur when patient have trouble move air in and out of their lung patient can also experience dyspnea if their lung are not get enough oxygen here some advice from teresa knoop rn msn aocn cancer information nurse specialist vanderbilt ingram cancer center about how patient can work with their healthcare team to treat their dyspnea and control the anxiety it can cause who get dyspnea patient with primary lung cancer commonly complain of dyspnea so do patient who have another type of cancer such a breast cancer that have spread to the lung say knoop but she explain people can also have dyspnea if they have any of these health issue emphysema heart diseasesome cancer treatment such a lung surgery radiation to the lung and certain chemotherapy may damage the lung and cause dyspnea other treatment such a drain the lung or place a catheter into the vein of the chest can also cause patient to experience dyspnea how is dyspnea evaluate dyspnea is subjective explain knoop a nurse we are dependent on the patient to describe and rate the sensation generally we ask patient to explain their breathlessness in term of mild moderate or severe dyspnea may prevent people from do something they normally do with ease say knoop that is why we often ask patient to describe how their dyspnea affect their daily life and their quality of life to help you talk with your doctor or nurse about dyspnea it may help to keep track of how it affect you keep a journal of when you have it what make it well and what make it bad how can dyspnea be treat treatment of dyspnea is usually direct toward the treatment of the underlying disease for example if fluid is collect in the lung the fluid may need to be drain to lessen the dyspnea chemotherapy or radiation therapy may shrink a tumor to lessen the dyspnea if dyspnea is being cause by an infection antibiotic may be require say knoop your doctor may treat dyspnea with medication here are some option for that bronchodilator open a patient airway and decrease their dyspnea steroid help reduce any swelling in the lung that may be cause the shortness of breath anti anxiety drug can help the cycle of panic lead to more breathing difficulty pain medication can make breathing easy your doctor might also prescribe oxygen ask your healthcare team about breathing and relaxation technique you can try on your own what can a patient do to manage dyspnea relaxation exercise meditation breathing technique conservation of energy and limitation of activity may be helpful in deal with dyspnea say knoop these technique may also control your anxiety level an important part of treat dyspnea it might also be helpful to change the way you sit or sleep patient with dyspnea may find it helpful to try sit upright in a chair lean forward slightly and rest their forearm on the arm of the chair or their knee to help their lung to expand sleep with several pillow or in a recliner can also help here are two type of breathe technique to manage dyspnea always talk with your doctor or nurse before try these technique it can also be helpful to talk to a respiratory or physical therapist for hint on how to manage dyspnea purse lip breathe to do this type of breathing keep the lip press together tightly except for the very center take normal breath breathe in through the nose then take twice a long to breathe through the center of your mouth in summary plb is find to be effective to improvegas exchange and reduce dyspnea those patient with loss of elastic recoil pressure that is more emphysematous lung defect seem to benefit more from practice this technique however it application during exercise do not improve blood gas it effectiveness during exertion need further research body positionrelief of dyspnea is often experience by patient in the forward lean position a body position commonly adopt by patient with lung disease the benefit of this position seem unrelated to the severity of airway obstruction change in minute ventilation or improved oxygenation however the presence of hyperinflation and paradoxical abdominal movement were indeed relate to relief of dyspnea in the forward lean position

thoracoabdominal movement from these open study it wa conclude that the subjective improvement of dyspnea in patient with emphysema wa the result of the more favorable position of the diaphragm on it length tension curve in addition forward lean with before midday support allow accessory muscle pectorali minor and major to significantly contribute to rib cage elevation in summary the forward lean

my boyfriend wa diagnose with aml on january 3rd 2017 so we are new to this community for those of you who have time to read this i am go to try my good to describe our experience thus far and hopefully someone will have some advice to give i if you have any question please feel free to ask a there is a lot of information we have obtain in a short period of time and it is easy for i to miss something a little back round greg and i have been together for 7 month and we have a bit of an age gap between the two of we i just have my 22nd birthday on the 16th of december and he just have his 35th birthday the 30th of december we were both bear and raise in alaska and the both of we have never been married nor have kid often in alaska people form a type of seasonal depression in the wintertime because of the lack of sunshine and constant darkness mid november is kind of when greg start act weird in the sense that he wa pretty tired most of the time and keep talk about how hard it wa to get up the stair and little thing like that a athletic and active a he is i have assumption that he wa develop a seasonal depression at the time he have no health insurance and a most man are do not want to see a doctor anyways a time go on his tan complexion become very pale and he develop serious lack of appetite and energy i wa so confused and concerned by his behavior and tell he he need to either apply for health insurance or go to the er without insurance i think he must have some sort of anemia with the way he bruise so easily and that maybe he wa depressed a well it wa not only concern but it wa affect our relationship i remember a couple day before christmas greg and i were lay in bed and he just flat out tell i that he know he have leukemia base on what he have read of the internet we both cry together that night especially i because the thought that my boyfriend might have cancer never even cross my mind it have hit i hard after i have read the symptom of leukemia but the possibility wa so scary i just shrug it off it wasna t until the 3rd of january when he have hardly been out of bed for 3 day except to go to the bathroom and shower that i give he the ultimatum and say that he wa either go to the hospital or i wa go to leave he it seem like he wa die before my own eye and i wa not go to watch he suffer any more diagnosis it take a little le than an hour from the time we get to the er to diagnose he with leukemia fear run through i know that greg do not have any health insurance and i know this wa far more than just get help for depression or anemia the news wa a shock and emotion were high alaska do treat leukemia patient but i suppose that his count alarm the doctor enough that they feel a if he need to be medevaca d a soon a possible to the university of washington medical center the problem wa that he have a hemoglobin the amount of oxygen in his blood of 3 where a you and i have a hemoglobin of 15 16 in order for any person to fly they at least need hemoglobin of 7 so 4 blood infusion later he wa at hemoglobin of 7 and we were fly out in a leer jet around 6 am on january the 4th by some miracle greg have apply for medicaid about mid december and we have not hear from they since so he and i both assume that he wa still uninsured before we leave the er a lady pop her head into our room and say something a simple a alaska medicaid is go to take care of you do not worry about anything i remember my jaw drop and this huge weight wa lift of our chest duration in the hospital we arrive at the uw medical center early in the morning on january 4th our room wa beautiful with a great view of a harbor and mt rainier greg wa so full of energy and he finally have color in his skin again think back i wa so naive yes people become pale in the winter in alaska but i should have been more alarmed when he look almost transparent and his lip were kind of a yellowish color those 4 blood bag have give he so much life our attend doctor dr pamela becker so i am tell and truly believe it is the good in the country and we are fortunate enough to have she my understanding is that the typical way that they diagnose the type of leukemia a patient have is a bone marrow biopsy but because his blood wa 60 leukemia cell it mean his bone marrow wa at least 60 90 leukemia cell so they do not see the need for a bone marrow biopsy a they want to start chemo a soon a possible another thing you guy should know is that on january 1st twenty one year ago greg mom pas away after a little over a year fight with all leukemia before dr becker know the type of leukemia he have they really want to look into see if his leukemia wa genetic when it come back a an aml diagnosis they wipe that possibility off the table they begin his g clam chemo regiman on the 7th of january which is administer daily for 5 day the first day of chemo he have so much energy that he walk 4 mile around the oncology floor which we learn about 2 day later wa a huge mistake he have do such little activity the past couple month that his calfa s have become so sore and stiff from the 4 mile walk that he literally could not walk his body could not heal he like a normal healthy person body would and it very much affect he with his symptom to come from the chemo the following night he wa unable to control his bowel and i wa not strong enough to be able to carry he to the restroom the first night this wa happen wa probably the first time in a long time that we have actually have an uncontrollable laugh i remember we were in the middle of a conversation and he sneeze and look at i in shock say hannah i just shit myself the bad part wa that he couldna t lift himself up because of the condition of his calfa s so the scene wa a messy one it wa a little early in life than i expect but here i wa change my boyfrienda s diaper which we still get a good laugh at at the same time he wa run a high fever get up to 104 7 at it is high for about 4 day and have sever rigger which make his body even more sore by the 5th or 6th day he wa still unable to walk but we have kind of get the diarrhea under control and we finally get some help from a physical therapist to help he get the strength to walk again on top of everything else greg is naturally a thin guy normally weigh 160 165lb at a height of 61 he weigh about 145lbs when he wa admit into the hospital and if i think it wa hard to get food down his throat before diagnosis chemo and fever cause by the chemo definitely do not help the situation when he wa finally stabilize enough to be discharge from the hospital two week from the time we were admit he weigh 137lbs this time in the hospital all seem like a blur i wa frustrate with myself because i wa suppose to be the person to support he and be strong for he and i often find myself in the bathroom or hallway sobbing of course now i realize that those feeling are all very natural and for those of you read this that are the front line for your love one and feel the same way that this is all okay and we need to let ourselves feel that way now he now is an outpatient at the seattle cancer care alliance and go there every other day when he first become an outpatient we were tell that his disease itself is categorize a trisomy 6 we do his bone marrow biopsy on the 8th of february and the result come back that he still have 12 leukemia cell in his bone marrow and 0 in his blood i have hope he would be in remission so this wa not the good news however the doctor reassure we that this is normal for a person who have such a high volume when he wa first admit so on the 15th we start his second round of his g clam regimen he say he honestly have not feel this good in over a year and the chemo have yet to affect this i hope that since the chemo do not have a much to kill off this round that he doesna t have such a hard time with all of this like he do last time he also have gain weight since he wa last in the hospital and now weigh 150lbs and look so much well than he have this past couple month his face is full and bright and is just very happy for someone with an aggressive cancer greg is an only child so they are currently look for a bone marrow donor for he right now we have 3 scenario a to what is go to happen next scenario 1 greg go into remission after this treatment and if they have a donor match then he will go straight to transplant scenario 2 greg go into remission but they have not find a donor match for he if that happen they will send we back to alaska to receive chemo treatment to keep he in remission until they find he a donor then we will go back to seattle and he will receive his transplant scenario 3 greg do not go into remission and we continue to attack the cancer with chemo treatment in seattle until he do go into remission and can get he into transplant we will not find out any of this for another 4 week when they can get a bone marrow biopsy and see where he is if he is able to go into transplant he will do the prep for transplant which i am completely unsure what this really consist of the 20 30 day prior to transplant and then when he receive his stem cell transplant he stay in transplant housing for another 100 day,neutral,neutral

needle the removed tissue is then study by a pathologist a physician specialist train in determine disease from laboratory test who report the result to your physician this test can be do several way but the percutaneous method is very common this is do by stick a needle through the rib into the liver a small piece of liver tissue is suck into the needle and pull out the process is very quick and relatively painless for people with special concern such a those who are high risk of excessive bleeding the procedure may be do differently who need a biopsy doctor order liver biopsy for many reason for people with hepatitis a biopsy can determine what cause the disease by look at the liver tissue microscopically a physician can see if the damage wa cause by virus or toxin or even a combination of several thing if cirrhosis is present liver biopsy can determine how advanced the fibrosis is and can assign it a grade in order to compare future change in fact liver biopsy is the most accurate

damage to liver tissue it is not coincidence that the problem associate with biopsy are similar to the contraindication for biopsy if you are already experience similar problem that can be cause by the procedure doctor will probably want to avoid give you a biopsy how is a biopsy take to prepare for your liver biopsy your doctor will schedule the test at the hospital so in case anything go wrong additional medical support will be available you ll probably be ask not to eat or drink anything for about 8 hour before the procedure and your doctor will also probably order blood test to see if your blood properly clot for the test you ll probably lie on your back and have your right before midday position above your head the doctor may want to feel your liver by press on your belly just under your rib cage once the site is choose topical antiseptic will be apply to your skin to reduce the risk of infection you ll be awake for the entire procedure but you ll have local anesthetic usually lidocaine which is the same drug that dentist use to numb your gum apply to the area after the site is properly numb the doctor will insert the special biopsy needle into the skin between your tenth and eleventh rib from the side of your body the goal is to pierce the liver with the needle low enough to miss your lung and diaphragm but high enough to miss the intestine the needle stick is very quick and believe it or not relatively painless the actual procedure will go fast depend on the method about 20 minute but you ll need to stay after the test for several hour so the doctor can monitor your recovery if no problem are see then you ll be able to leave however at home you ll probably need to rest and take it easy for one or two day to give your liver time to heal,neutral,neutral

i start post a month ago with my update after not being on here for a few year brief history 5 year ago i wa tell after a liver biopsy that i have a year or le to live and no transplant for i because i drink and transplant wa all that could help i i wa not put on any med and i never hear from that doctor again i quit drinking and spend year on my own healing which i have mention in past post about a month ago i see another liver specialist who want lot of testing and want to put i on transplant list for his fear of my develop cancer due to the cirrhosis he wa not optimistic and rattle off statistic instead of look at i a an individual all i want wa an ultrasound to see my progress because i know my body wa heal i do not see he again and look for another doctor i find one two week ago and he is awesome he listen to i and he actually try to be optimistic even though he have see a lot in his profession i wish that more people know the power of doctor suggestion people hear they need a transplant or they hear all the stat and so their subconscious make it so those thought sabotage their body natural instinct to heal i like to think of myself in a speed car head straight to my destination of a healthy liver when doctor say transplant or cancer or whatever it may be that is the opposite of perfect liver health those word whiz pas the driver side window out of the corner of my eye and were behind i in the distance far behind and forget about because i wa stay on my road to liver health i mention to the doctor that my liver is my savior and my friend i tell he how whenever i stress about something my liver cramp or swell a little or knock at my abdomen it let i know to breathe and calm my stress because stress can not help you heal when i take notice and calm the stress my liver soften and breathe a well i can feel it he say he find that interesting because he is never think of a correlation between the brain and the liver i tell he that it is true because that is the way it is he then admit that he do not know it all just western medicine guess he never read it in a medical book i do not know so we set up an ultrasound for the following week last week to check on my progress during my ultrasound i ask a lot of question about what wa on the screen she keep tell i with a smile that she could not tell i i ask what the red and blue wa and she do tell i that it wa the blood flow through my liver hmm blood flow that is good so i try something that i do every day with my liver a i watch the screen i send pure love to my liver immediately the red and blue just explode through my liver the blood flow increase big time there is my proof that there is a correlation between the brain and the liver not that i need proof the next day my doctor assistant call with the result i miss the call but listen to the message here what she say your result come up normal call with any question normal what how could it be normal i have cirrhosis what s normal about that i have a mass in my abdoman what s normal about that too i wa able to reach the doctor office and ask these question after a long conversation with my doctor she call i back and this is what she say your liver is healthy there is no scar all of your surround organ are in perfect health a well we do not need to check for cancer anymore because you do not have cirrhosis my head wa spin and i hug my liver well what about that mass below my liver she say the doctor do not know if you were bear with it or if your liver create it but it is a riedel lobe it is an extension of your right lobe which resemble a 3rd small liver lobe which give you even more healthy cell and well liver function i say to she so i am fine she giggle and say yes sarah you are just fine i thank she a if she have been the one who work for year to reverse the cirrhosis when i hang up the phone i say to my liver we do it i love you and i will always treat you kindly i have always hear that cirrhosis is

hi everybody i just want to say that accord to scientific research more then half of people who have hep c never develop liver cirrhosis or cancer of cause if you have a certain life style like no drinking or smoke healthy diet and if you do not have other health problem they say if you make it to 60 with hep c most likely you will die from something else it do not apply to everyone though again of cause it is well to get rid off it and start treatment no doubt but i think we scare all these young people on this site let we be more positive and optimistic especially because we can see clearly on this site that it have more success story then the other way around a i say million of people live with it happily cause they do not know they have it and only 1 5 develop cirrhosis or liver cancer again hip c is not sickness it just a condition in which the patient might develop cirrhosis or liver cancer i wish everybody to believe in yourself and believe in new triple medicine and new light med is come out soon hep c is treatable now we live in a different world cheer up,positive,positive

what i see with the report i call my dr office for my doc interpretation basically there were incidental finding but nothing require any concern or followup within the same call i make an appt with my

i have never post anything here before but i have often come here to read post and i would like to thank all of you for share your story a they have help i and my family alot i hope that i can bring some hope to all of you my father have nsclc that have spread all over his lung and to the adjacent lymph node numerous chemotherapy help to shrink the tumor but eventually stop work in decemberhe wa put on iressa a a step to merely prolong his life it work great and not only stop the cancer from grow but considerably shrink the tumour along side this he wa also take a number of chinese herbal combination to boost his immune system eventually the iressa stop shrink the tumour and just prevent their growth this wa good enough for we slowly my father start develop some tingle sensation in his leg and foot and have back pain he wa check out and they find a mass of inflammation in his spine the doctor initially think it to be cancer because they do not know what else it could be they decide to radiate the mass and this mean that for three week my father would have to go off of iressa i have do some internet research and find an herbal remedy for cancer call essiac tea i think that we would get he drink it 4 oz twice a day while he wa on radiation because it wa know to be excellent for deal with the side effect of cancer treatment after 3 week the doctor decide to take an x ray of his lung to see how badly the cancer have grow while he wa off the iressa they say not to worry to much a any new growth would be handle by the iressa to everyone surprise the x ray reveal that my father lung were completely clean the are plan still to do a ct scan to double check but nobody can believe what they see on the x ray i do not know if it wa the tea but i do not know what else it could have been the radiation wa point at his throat area not his lung take home message 1 do not believe everything your oncologist tell you a year ago they tell he that he have 2 month to live do your own research and try everything you can the doctor now are say they do not know what s in his spine and the radiation have make it bad if anybody have ever hear of any spine disorder let i know we are still try to understand what this is so while we are happy the cancer is go in his lung we have a new le scary problem to face 2 prayer is important i do not have the space here to discus all the particular but god will guide you to any answer if you ask he to do not concern yourself with which religion to follow they are just tool to uncover god they are not god themselves is the cancer the choice of the god above you or the god within you everything have it purpose when you figure out what that is you will move on take time to expand your mind and enlighten yourself to infinite possibility and understand 3 herbal and natural remedy do work try to find an experienced herbalist to examine you and give you the proper herb give essiac tea a shot it might work for you too i know how hard this can be but do not lose faith my prayer are with you,positive,positive

transplant patient could grow their own liver a scientist turn skin into organ cell by fiona macrae last update at 2 18 am on 26th august 2010 comment 4 add to my story scientist have create liver cell from sliver of skin the technique could one day be use to grow organ that are perfect match to the patient desperately ill transplant patient could be able to grow their own liver within just five year british doctor say today the announcement follow a landmark study in which cambridge university researcher turn sliver of skin from patient arm into liver cell scale up the technique could be use to generate full sized liver each a perfect match to the patient the breakthrough which come amid soar rate of liver disease will also hasten the search for new drug for a condition which kill more briton each year than diabetes and traffic accident combine up to 600 transplant are carry out annually but some patient will inevitably die while wait for a suitable donor the experiment involve take sliver of skin from patient with inherited liver disease and use a cocktail of chemical to turn they into stem cell master cell able to turn into other cell type the stem cell were then coax into become liver cell researcher dr tamir rashid liken the change from skin to liver cell to persuade a group of musician to play a different type of music he say it is a bit like get an orchestra to change from play classical music to rock music the cell have the same genetic material we have only change the type of music it is play it have go from a skin type of music to a liver type of music and that is exciting the lab grow liver cell carry the genetic hallmark of the patient disease comparison with healthy cell will allow researcher to find out more about the cause of their illness dr rashid say i see hundred of patient every year and they always ask i the same thing why do they have liver disease when their neighbour drink the same amount and is expose to the same environment i am never able to answer that now i can take an individual patient and generate liver cell and research why this person have liver disease and another person do not patch of diseased cell could also be use to rapidly test hundred of thousand of drug speed up the search for new treatment and cut the need for animal experiment the cambridge team is also try to fix the diseased cell with the eventual before midday of transplant healthy cell into the patient dr rashid say one approach is to grow patch of liver the other approach is what we talk about in science fiction but is rapidly become more of a reality reproduce the whole organ and put it back i do not expect we to be able to offer that for five to 10 year we have to be absolutely sure before we do that dr ludovic vallier another of the study author say our work represent an important step towards deliver the clinical promise of stem cell however more work need to be do and our group is dedicate towards achieve this ultimate goal by increase the knowledge necessary for the development of new therapy hurdle to overcome include create a liver with all the type of cell need for full function include specialise cell that destroy bacteria and other invader cell take from human liver are notoriously difficult to work with the laboratory and scientist have search for decade for an alternative supply the technology to turn skin cell into liver cell have been available for several year but this is the first time it have been use successfully on people with liver disease use a person own cell would remove the risk of the new organ being reject by the body more than a million briton are live with liver disease and 16 000 die a year soar rate of obesity binge drinking and hepatitis mean the number of death is predict to double in just 20 year professor humphrey hodgson of the british liver trust say we welcome this new research from cambridge university with a further refinement of the technique which should lead to stem cell therapy become a reality for liver disease and the approach of this team have particular potential for further exploration and understanding of genetic cause of liver disease and aid development of therapy like many new technology under development make stem cell therapy a reality will take time i think we can be confident it will in due course really help in liver disease though it will take a number of year before we see the technology in our liver clinic and available to help patient the study which is report in the journal of clinical investigation wa fund by the wellcome trust and the medical research council print this article read later email to a friend share this read more http www dailymail co uk health article 1306100 transplant patient grow liver scientist turn skin organ cell html ixzz0xi4zip5u,neutral,neutral

my doctor find a 4 cm polyp in my cecum during a routine colonoscopy i wa shocked because i think i wa the pillar of health and there were no symptom he say it look benign but he could not tell for sure and that he would send some biopsy specimen to pathology the pathology report say that they it wa a tubulovillous adenoma which mean it wa a benign polyp however my doctor say that he still could not be sure that the whole polyp wa benign because those specimen were just a small part of the polyp he say that he must remove the polyp totally to see if there were part of cancer in there i wa tell that even if it wa totally benign it still have to be remove because adenoma over time turn into cancer so now wa the search to find a doctor to remove it i go to one surgeon and he say that he would have to remove ten inch of my intestine the lymph nod the polyp and most of the cecum because even though it might be a benign polyp it might be cancerous and he do not want to have to do another surgery i wa tell i would be in the hospital for a week to ten day and home for three week and that this surgery wa being do with general anesthesia also my stomach would never been the same but i would learn to readjust and eat differently to avoid problem go to the bathroom i go to another surgeon and he basically say the same thing so i research the internet and i find an alternate method which few doctor care to mention i discover that large polyp in the cecum can be remove with a special type of colonoscopy use emr i wa tell that the cecum is extremely thin about 2 dime thick and only a handful of very skilled doctor can remove a large polyp with an emr colonoscopy i do my research and i find two renowned doctor from new york city dr haber and dr waye who have the expertise to do this procedure i choose doctor jerome waye to remove my 4 cm polyp i schedule my procedure with dr waye do my prep for this polypectomy walk in on the day schedule and in one hour later walk out feel fine the doctor remove the entire polyp after i have to eat soft food and food with no fiber for 4 day i stay home the next day but probably if i have to could have go to work the following week i call the office and i wa tell that my 4 cm polyp in my cecum wa not cancerous i promise myself that if i have a positive outcome i would post something on this health board because when i originally find out i have a 4 cm polyp and go online to research it everything everywhere say it wa doom and gloom website were give statistic about the size of the polyp in relationship to the possibility of it being cancerous it look to i i could not have escape cancer since it wa so large they were wrong also all the blog i read say that after the speciman say it wa benign when they totally take it out there wa some cancer in it mine have no cancer in it after the entire polyp wa remove all the people were blogge that their 4 cm benign polyp turn out to be stage 3 or stage 4 after totally remove it i wa cancer free people who have benign polyp specimen still go through major surgery i go the colonoscopy emr route my intestine and colon wa not compromise i do not go through major surgery like most doctor recommend and my inside are the same a before so if you just find out you have a large polyp in your cecum and it look benign there is hope it probably will be totally benign have faith because now you know my story also if it is in the cecum you might want to go the emr colonoscopy route i am not a doctor and can not tell you what to do i can only tell you what i do and how my nightmare end on a positive note good luck to you i,positive,positive

i have read a lot of discussion about smoking being a factor for develop lung cancer and also not being one and their thought towards it i agree that smoking for the most part is not the wise of idea if your wanting to lead a healthy life i do not agree with the fact that it cause it since i know too many people that have smoke many year and never develop lung cancer i believe that it is cause from a breakdown in the immune system where essential vitamin are lose or need and of course gene that are pas down to we it seem by now that they could detect these gene and also give something to people especially over the age of 50 to strengthen the immune system and make good cell strong to fight the bad cell that spread cancer my mom do develop lung cancer and do smoke so she do fall under that stereotype of lung cancer but there are very many that never have without cigarette my mom would of been miserable in her later day because that is all she have since she wa a widow by 7 year when she past away and they comfort she and relax she and she enjoy it very much by the way she have degenerative bone disease since her early twenty and have always suffer with bone pain for many year she also become diabetic in her 50 so i have to think that just possibly the cancer come from some of those factor since i see a lot of people have diabete and then cancer i have read an article about cancer and it state that cancer cell love sugar so you should really watch your sugar intake i am glad my mom have her cigarette because they were like a good friend to she and she would of been miserable without in her final month so i do not blame she for that at all or the cigarette a i mention too many people who do not smoke or drink develop cancer a my mother in law even do and die at the age of 53 like her father who do not smoke and it wa determined that it wa an aggressive genetic cancer now we have to worry about my husband and our child whom it would not matter what they do because his mom eat very healthy and do not have bad habit i guess my message is that you should do what make you happy and try to limit some of the bad of course but just be comfortable in what you are do because life can be too short to do without and my mom die do what she love and i would not have it any other way and good for she we love you mom i think you should just do what ever make you feel good because in the end it would not matter because what go to happen will happen and that is that it is aggravating but i really am start to believe 100 in that i also do not like the way people who develop lung cancer are treat by some and especially doctor do not blame yourself for this disease just because it is call lung cancer my heart go out to all of you suffer with this disease good luck and good wish for success,positive,positive

hi newbie here in browse the internet last night i find something interesting and just want to post it here gluten and casein a factor responsible for the characteristic disease of chronic hepatitis c not everyone expose to hcv develop a chronic infection the rate of natural clearance is unknown because most people are not aware they are infect until the condition become chronic one know factor in chronic infection with viral hepatitis a b is selenium deficiency in malnourished population celiac disease the most easily diagnose form of gluten toxicity is know to cause selenium deficiency in well feed population celiac also cause a general deficiency of many antioxidant protein and mineral and vitamin there is a strong association between hcv and celiac disease in many population test there is an even strong association between interferon alpha treatment and celiac disease interferon alpha is the cytokine that trigger celiac disease naturally celiac disease is only the easy to diagnose of the gluten sensitivity syndrome it result in destruction of the intestinal cell vilii damage which can be detect on biopsy even so celiac is seriously underdiagnosed it is likely that anyone in new zealand with the symptom of celiac disease who is hcv positive will be tell that their symptom are due to hepatitis c testing for celiac will happen slowly and most likely not at all unless the patient insist and test for other form of gluten sensitivity is unlikely milder form of gluten sensitivity might only disrupt those gut receptor responsible for function such a immune regulation especially endorphin receptor mineral transport or absorption of specific vitamin antibody may form to the proline rich gluten gliadin and casein sequence release by peptide digestion which enter the bloodstream which then attack the proline rich collagenous tissue promote disease such a liver fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis it so happen that the auto immune symptom associate with celiac and gluten sensitivity disease include liver and gall bladder disease and which usually resolve slowly on a strict gluten and dairy free diet are essentially identical to the various syndrome see in chronic hep c especially during or after interferon alpha treatment syndrome cause by gluten in celiac disease include fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver gall bladder obstruction insulin resistance thyroiditis sicca syndrome dry eye and mouth vasculitis brain fog poor memory confusion depression fibromyalgia fatigue optic neuritis deficiency of selenium magnesium zinc chromium deficiency of fat soluble vitamin a d e k deficiency of those vitamin convert in the intestine include folate b6 anaemia thrombocytopenic purpurea low platelet due to autoimmunity gi disturbance diarrhea steatorrhea these symptom are aggravate by the nutrient deficiency especially antioxidant magnesium and chromium deficiency associate with gluten sensitivity in fact the symptom of both hep c and celiac disease are often partially but significantly relive by supplementation of these nutrient especially when anti inflammatory botanical curcumin grape seed ginkgo milk thistle and so on are add other treatment effective against hep c have obvious link to gluten sensitivity for example low dose naltrexone may exert it beneficial effect on cancer autoimmune disease and viral immunity by repair damage do to endorphin receptor by gluten and casein digest similarly enzyme therapy for cancer may work by promote the complete digestion of gluten and casein exorphin and the ketogenic diet for cancer may work by eliminate grain and lower insulin level and hence inflammation rather than merely by deprive cancer cell of glucose exorphin are chemical find in protein digest the peptide produce by pepsin digestion of food protein which have an affinity for endorphin receptor endorphin are the messenger of emotion and gluten sensitivity is very often find in schizophrenia autism adhd asperger and the various mood disorder however the endorphin system also regulate the immune system and defect of endorphin and endorphin receptor are associate with cancer and autoimmune disease a well a aid endorphin also regulate gut motility the well know constipate effect of cheese is an opioid effect even people who have no gluten antibody and no leaky gut which allow gluten digest to enter the bloodstream in especially large dose are influence by the opioid effect of exorphin at the local gut level diagnose non celiac gluten and casein sensitivity without exclusion diet is difficult if not impossible commonly in new zealand a scratch test for gluten is the doctora s first choice this is bad than useless because we are not talk about an allergy to gluten at all though these do exist when gluten milk and maize are digest in the stomach by pepsin and hydrochloric acid a variety of peptide are release the exact combination of peptide that might appear in the gut vary with the individual the state of his digestion and the strain of wheat milk or maize consume gliadomorphin is a characteristic wheat exorphin beta casomorphin 7 is think to be the most toxic milk exorphin and the maize exorphin have not yet been identify autoimmune reaction to antigenic peptide is not the only way in which exorphin can harm we so the current insistence on immunological testing seem limited also current test do not include antibody to every possible peptide digest of gluten this would probably be impossible luckily no one need to eat grain our ancestor get along in well health without they for million of year grain consumption is a comparatively recent phenomenon in human history very recent indeed in some case in northern europe and in colonized oceania it is a habit of mere century if that in part of the world where grain eating go back long for example the eastern mediterranean there is a high rate of adaptation this do not mean that individual adapt to grain individual die young or become sterile if they lack the more grain adapt gene in order that the race might adapt but this still do not rule out the disease of late life study of remain of grain dependent society such a rome and ancient egypt show that so call a moderna disease such a arthritis and cancer were prolific there it is trendy to think that such disease result from technology radiation pesticide food processing and that it can be prevent with an organic vegetarian diet the sad truth is that in most case wheat and milk even organic wheat and milk a product of the old agricultural revolution a are do more harm than those trace of the modern industrial revolution that we can not avoid if our immune system and our detox enzyme can not cope with some new agricultural chemical the most likely reason is the disruption they have receive from the old agricultural chemical a gluten and casein it wa also agriculture not food processing that first place man in a guilty relationship with his food pre agricultural man kill to eat and take from the forest and have ritual that make peace with the animal and the plant he take from these bounteous god not from captive creature agricultural man kill for money pay other to kill for he and burn down the forest to plant his cash crop if this wa original sin then the wage of sin have indeed been death it is customary to blame lead pipe for the decline of rome the roman people were highly wheat addict they would riot for bread a bread and circusesa wa the formula for keep they happy they were so addicted that the state find it more convenient to supply bread for free like a methadone clinic for the opiate of the people today the state oversee the addition of gluten milk and maize to an ever widen range of food so that a mere bread shortage is not likely to cause withdrawal this is probably not intentional addict tend to assume that everyone want to share their habit in the case of rome wheat and lead may have have a synergistic toxicity both lead poisoning and wheat consumption tend to reduce iron and zinc absorption this is why celiac child are often of short stature the roman would have become increasingly incapable of sensible planning and come to lack the stern old roman self control we know that a decrease birthrate of a true borna roman eventually lead to the conscription of barbarian army and the opening up of roman citizenship today gluten and the antioxidant deficiency it cause is a major cause of infertility research have been do into the link between gluten sensitivity and hep c show a strong association especially after interferon therapy there is also a strong association between hep c and lymphoma a cancer of the lymph gland lymphoma is the characteristic cancer cause by gluten celiac have a 30x elevated risk of lymphoma to date no one seem to have test a strict gluten and dairy free diet for chronic hep c or post interferon toxicity but a great many people with hep c who take their health seriously have gone gluten free often without know of the link between the two condition but motivate by their own well being when avoiding gluten there is no nutritional need that can only be meet by grain nut and seed for example supply the same amino acid fat and vitamin in great concentration for example sunflower and sesame seed are superior source of methionine and vitamin e while legume are rich in complex carbohydrate gluten is also a cause of insulin resistance and everyone who develop liver fibrosis have some degree of insulin resistance gluten itself cause a four fold rise in insulin level unusual for a protein the cure for insulin resistance is two fold a high protein low carb diet the paleolithic diet is the most natural version of this diet and replacement of the nutrient deplete by gluten which are essential for the function of insulin receptor chromium magnesium and the antioxidant mineral and vitamin gluten also seem to cause amino acid deficiency include some of the very amino acid which wheat is suppose to supply methionine and cysteine gluten is very much an anti nutrient once one is sensitive to it recommend reading on gluten

with neurological illness of unknown origin the sensitivity to gluten among sibling of celiac in spite of the absence of genetic indicator associate with celiac disease and my own investigation of the literature regard lymphoma all point to the strong possibility that gluten is a dangerous substance to many more people than just celiac ron hoggan 1997 to which i might add the parallel association

hi all i have lurk on these forum for year but this is my first time post since i do not really know where else to turn and i am just look for some support and advice i am 35 yr old and male early this year i have an ultrasound of my liver due to elevated liver function on my blood test i wa take crestor at the time for elevated cholesterol during the ultrasound they find something which then require a follow up mri mri show a 4 8 cm mass i go to the gi for consultation and he wa call it a complex cyst and he order blood test to check for cancer marker those test come back negative and he say we should wait 3 month and re image and do the blood work again to check my liver function so fast forward to now after see the next round of mri image and blood work which wa perfectly normal by the way the gi is call it an adenoma which he say is most likely benign but have about a 15 chance of turn malignant at some point the mri report say 5 cm this time but he say that the 2 cm wa negligible base on the equipment radiologist and so on so he consider it stable however he do recommend that i consult with a surgeon to have it remove at some point so that is my next stop in 2 week my concern are 1 from my research this seem to be a problem that effect mainly woman due to birth control have any man here been diagnose with an adenoma and what wa the outcome 2 another thing is that i am extremely terrified that this might be metastasis from cancer somewhere else in my body i have gerd and chronic gastritis and those are go crazy due to this anxiety so i feel like every ache and pain is indicative of a terrible problem of course bloat burn stomach and so on is the 1 sign of almost every abdominal cancer should i have my doctor order a colonoscopy is this fear even rational i would love to hear anyone else experience with something like this i think the anxiety is the bad part and not really feel like i am in control at the very least i will update with my result so other can learn from my experience a well thank chris,neutral,negative

http www ajc com health content share 30613 html new compound shrink skin cancer wednesday sept 2 healthday news an experimental cancer drug that switch off the so call hedgehog pathway beat back tumor in more than half of patient with advanced basal cell carcinoma a type of skin cancer the drug also help a 26 year old man suffer from medulloblastoma the most common form of brain cancer in child we were both pleased and surprised we have hope that we might see response like this but we in no way anticipate that within the context of a phase 1 clinical trial we would see this level of anti tumor activity say dr charles m rudin who author two paper on the finding that appear in the sept 2 online edition of the new england journal of medicine these are the first report in the literature of any hedgehog inhibitor being use clinically phase 1 trial are conduct to look at a drug safety profile and determine the right dose phase 2 and phase 3 trial typically look at effectiveness also exciting however is the fact that the hedgehog pathway have been implicate in other cancer notably colon cancer and ovarian cancer albeit in a different way researcher are go forward to look at the potential of the molecule know a gdc 0449 to treat these type of cancer a a one drug regiman and in combination with other drug for other solid tumor malignancy say rudin who is associate director for clinical research at the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center at john hopkins university in baltimore one expert note that find a compound that might control the hedgehog pathway could have far reach implication these are phase 1 trial so they are quite preliminary but the drug is quite effective in at least a subset of the patient treat say dr andrzej dlugosz author of an accompany editorial and a professor in the department of dermatology at the university of michigan medical school and comprehensive cancer center in ann arbor the reason were so excited is that there are now a large number of cancer that have also been link to abnormality in this pathway include pancreatic colon ovarian and prostate it is quite an impressive list the datum is pretty strong suggest that if you shut down the pathway it can have a pretty profound effect on those tumor cell if it can work in these cancer maybe it can work in other cancer even though the signal there is more complex but another researcher warn that it is premature to get too excited about the result it is great to see something with so much potential but it really is potential say dr clifford perlis director of mohs micrographic surgery and dermatologic surgery at fox chase cancer center in philadelphia however he add there are other company develop hedgehog inhibitor a well so i think people should be pay attention to this the hedgehog gene so name because it wa first discover in fly with hair resemble the spike of hedgehog is really important during early embryonic development in pretty much all animal specie from fly to mouse to human and for pretty much every tissue you can imagine explain frederic de sauvage also an author on both paper but remarkably in adult it seem to be mostly turn off de sauvage is vice president of research molecular biology at genentech which develop the molecule and fund the study some 1 million american get basal cell carcinoma each year it often do not spread but once it have there are no approve treatment medulloblastoma is an aggressive form of brain tumor the first trial enrol 33 individual whose basal cell carcinoma have spread locally or to distant organ half of the participant who have distant metastasis see a reduction in tumor size a do 60 percent of those with locally advanced cancer the rest have either stable or progressive disease after 10 month of follow up but stable in this population may not mean much perlis point out a it is generally a very slow grow cancer the man with medulloblastoma also see a significant shrinkage of his tumor along with vastly improved quality of life but only for two month he later die a third study by some of the same author this one publish online sept 2 in science express discover that treatment with gdc 0449 actually spur another mutation in a gene call smo which cause the brain tumor to become resistant to the drug because the hedgehog pathway do not actually do much in adult side effect were minimal say de sauvage gdc 0449 would likely be use very differently depend on which type of cancer it is target in the case of basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma the mutation in the hedgehog pathway really drive the formation of these tumor de sauvage say this molecule inhibit the pathway very specifically and to date we only know of these two type of tumor where the pathway is mutate that mean gdc 0449 is effective on it own but in colon and ovarian cancer he continue the pathway recruit surround cell to promote the cancer in these type of tumor gdc 0449 would have to be

hi i dona t know if ia m write to the right forum but anyway ia d like to share the story of my mothera s disease with you and ask what you think about the a treatmenta shea s get now and ia ll welcome any suggestion a to what should be do in this case on the side of the doctor and family member and generally what would be the good for the patient excuse i in advance that it will be a bit too long but i just dona t want to leave out any detail in case it might turn out to be important so the story is a follow my mom is 70 year old ia m 24 by the way and shea s been smoke since she wa 20 a she is really old now shea s lose almost all her tooth and the few remain one occasionally start ache when she wa eat anyway one year ago when she wa have dinner she feel a sudden sharp pain again in her right tooth jaw but this time the pain wouldna t go away so she go to the dentista s a actually 3 or 4 dentist examine she in the course of the past year a but none of they could find anything wrong and thus couldna t ease her pain i cana t recall whether it wa on the same evening the jaw pain start or a few day later that the right side of her neck get swollen and then she immediately go to the ambulance where she get some injection calcium if ia m right and that solve that problem and the swelling never come back againa the jaw pain remain thougha to be precautious about this neck swell one of the doctor send she to another medical department where they examine her throat and come to the conclusion that there is some lump and a mild oedema on her vocal chord but they tell she that no operation wa need because this type of disease have a tendency to recrudesce and that this is something that generally doesna t become malignant in female anyway however out of precaution again from there she wa send to the pulmonary doctora s office because of the hoarseness of her voice which have been around for decade by the way a and thata s when she wa diagnose with a tumor in her right lung 5 centimeter 2 inch in diameter then but fortunately she hadna t been feel any lung chest pain until that time it wa only 2 month ago from now that she start to feel some occasional pain there but something go wrong on the day of the ct she catch a really bad cold and thus wa not in the right condition for the histological examination or for any further treatment for a few month in addition she wa just really afraid of the histological examination anyway because she hear many bad thing about it and she think she would be risk her life if she undergo that examinationa but that wa all 1 year ago so one thing lead to another there she wa have this ever painfully throb pain in her jaw which become even bad when she wa in a lie position no matter if she wa lie on her right or leave side so she just opt to sleep in a sitting position every day rest on her left elbow hold her head with her left handa and even a lump develop on her head right where her hand use to rest i dona t know whether it wa just a reaction of her body to the constant touching of her head skin or ita s already metastasis of the tumor moreover eat become a torture for she because of the increase jaw pain so she gradually eat le and le and lose quite much weight during this past year actually she wa 65 kilogram at the beginning if ia m right and lose something like 20 25 kilogram a to be really punctual she wa 165 cm tall and her normal weight wa 45 kg throughout her life it wa only when she retire that she put on some weight and have 65 kg so yeah basically i dona t know whether this loss of appetite wa actually due to the lung tumor or the jaw pain but her reason wa the jaw pain and maybe the jaw pain itself wa cause by the tumor i dona t know and to make thing bad she start to take more and more general painkiller to ease the pain a much a 5 6 pill on some day but usually 4 after a while take more painkiller than food so no surprise that after a few month her stomach start to hurt a well at the end in the last 2 month there were day when she just didna t eat anything at all and on well day she would eat like 3 4 bite of food but at least she drink lot of water and tea and coincidentally it wa one year ago too that i have to move away from home to another city because of my job and wa able to be with she only 3 and a half day a week and a being a widower with an only child i a mom just become really lonely and inactivea you know before that we have some nice walk in nearby park or in the city center but since then she just go to the nearby shop every morning and sometimes she visit i at this other city but basically that wa all the movement shea s do so she wa mainly sit in her armchair all day watch tv solve sudoku puzzle read the newspaper or some classic crime fiction novel like most old people do but in the last 2 month she wa mainly sleep almost all daya so her leg muscle become really really weak though her arm and hand remain strong but until the day she wa take to hospital 3 week ago she wa able to go to the toilet or to the fridge by herself by hold onto the furniture and to not leave out anything i have to tell that she start say strange thing 4 day before she wa take to hospital a like call the mineral water a mouth washa and a phone booka and something about she see blue book tie onto the ceiling of the balcony on rope some hour before and tell i it wa frightening she a so i dona t know whether she wa really hallucinate have some linguistic confusion in her brain or just dream and not being able to tell dream from reality and i dona t know what could have cause it cancer metastasis to the brain starvation the painkiller dream or all of they a but it just last 1 2 minute a day and throughout the rest of the day her mind wa totally clear normal anyway i tell she that these thing were non existent and tell she to ask i if she experience anything that seem impossible again before get frightened because probably they are just hallucination or dreamsa and she do she remain calm and ask i whether what she think to be happen wa the reality or not a for her thought on her condition she wa 100 sure that she have lung cancer with metastasis and that she would die soon and she decide that she want to die at home in peace avoid the hectic examination and treatment she would face in a hospital i wa tell she almost every day that she should see a doctor but she just refuse it all the timea she say therea s a time for each and every one of we to die and that her time is soon over and ask to leave she alone to die peacefully but 3 week ago her brother visit she after like half a year shea s get a brother and a sister by the way none of whom visit she much in the past few year anyway her brother decide that it wa now really time to take she to hospital so he and her sister take she there while i wa away at this other city and a quick 1 day examination have been do like x ray but no ct and thing like that and at the end of the day the doctor want to send she to the department where the terminally ill patient are look after but her brother have some connection and arrange that the pulmonary department would accept mom among it patient but a i see it ita s all the same at this pulmonary department they have the opinion that mom is incurable and so they dona t examine she far after the first day they dona t even know much about her tumor only know that ita s probably 9 cm in diameter because the x ray show something like that and they dona t treat she with cancer medication and i manage to find out that they treat she only with the usual infusion a painkill patch on her back and 3 different sedative and thata s what really make i worried and question this a therapya why on earth would any patient need tiapridal seduxen and haloperidol all 3 of they apply every day what i experience at this department where mom is now is that they dona t inform the patient and not even the family member other patient are experience the same and i could only read moma s medical chart secretly when the nurse were away for a momentum and thata s when i see that what they say to be pill injection for nausea high blood pressure and tachycardia are really just sedative and rather strong sedative i must say so strong that now ia m unable to communicate with mom because either shea s sleeping or talk like an infant say non sense thing and have almost no articulation so ita s hardly understandable on the rare occasion the sedative start to lose their impact on she she is read the newspaper and solve some sudoku puzzle like she do before the hospital but then after some 10 15 minute the nurse come again inject some a stuffa in she and then shea s go again mentally and spiritually a for the other condition there a soon a she get there they immediately apply a catheter although they know that she is able to urinate by herself and put a rolling toilet chair beside her bed for the a othera thinga and she could climb down the otherwise really high bed by herself if she want to use the toilet chair in her room ita s a 3 bed room by the way there is no handrail to hold onto when she want to get up there is only the rolling overbe table she can hold onto but one time when she want to get up this rolling thing just capsize and mom fall off the bed so they put rail on her bed so now shea s unable to go anywhere or even to sit up because her leg dona t fit through the bar of the rail and of course after 1 more day they just get bore of mom want to get down to the toilet chair and decide that they wona t take down the rail every time so they put a diaper on she instead a which she take off whenever her mind start to clear from the sedative because she still feel shea s able to go the toilet chair by herself and she doesna t want to make any a messa in her bed and then lie there cover in it the other thing is that the nurse dress up mom almost every time in a way that the catheter pipe is direct towards her back and the pipe itself and some bump on it hurt moma s back because shea s lie on the pipe all day so shea s complain about this back ache all the time and they mainly think ita s her lung that are ache and give she some painkiller and sedative againa and my explanation for they wa basically useless because okay they change the pipe to the other direction downwards right away but they just forget it by the next day so everything stay the same and mom is still have the same pain and there is some in bed bathe washing but that doesna t include brush the patientsa tooth so they just remain unwashed for day until i manage to visit mom and brush her tooth myself and sometimes the nurse ask i to give the pill to mom myself which i think is really cruel know that they are nothing but sedative although they dona t know that i know what they are well otherwise mom seem to have a tendency to get a really bad oedema from the cannula and even her other before midday get swollen a well where there is no cannula at the time and of course shea s have all the symptom of nicotine withdrawal a shea s not been smoke since shea s in hospital for 3 week and at first she just want to go home all the time but a soon a i could first visit her 3 day after she wa take in i tell she that the doctor say she wa incurable and that she would have been dead by then if she wasna t take to hospital and hear all this really suprise mom and she start to take her physical condition more seriously and she say that a okay then i opt to stay in hospital because it seem they can somehow keep i alive and we can be together for some more time and maybe there is some hope that they can strengthen i up with this infusion and then later maybe i can get cancer treatmenta it wa all before they start that heavy sedation treatment but we also decide together that i would bring she to the hospital of this other city where i live so that i could visit she every day and that would be a spiritual relief for she although there is a special lung sanatorium here in my city and there is a doctor that offer to treat she that doctor also say that mom have to be in a condition well enough for the examination and radiation therapy because all they can do in their insitution is to give she a 5 6 day treatment and then let she go home and she say the decision is up to i if i choose to still bring mom here now or later but she recommend to bring mom to my citya s chronic department instead where probably they could strengthen she up a bit so maybe after a while she could reach a well physical condition and that other treatment at the sanatorium wouldna t be so risky then and her present doctor tell i the same before that she doesna t dare to send mom to any further examination even inside the town because there is a risk that she could die on the way there but moma s tell i that even if she would die on the way leta s do it because if she die it would mean that she would have die anyway in a few day even if leave undisturbed but if she survive the examination then there would be a hope for cure her disease otherwise every doctor i contact here in my city a hungarian city call szege which have a famous university with many faculty and have 2 hospital and many clinic a so after read that 1 page examination sheet we get after that quick 1 day examination on moma s first day in the hospital every doctor in szege say that base on those symptom and physical condition describe there they think moma s not in such a bad state a her present doctor say and that they dona t know any possible reason that could exist for that heavy threefold seduction they apply there except that the doctor nurse there are too lazy and dona t want mom to complain or anything and they say that even care for she at home with no medication at all would be well than this a treatmenta shea s get now but my problem is now that moma s brother and sister dona t want i to bring mom here because they think the chronic department would be bad than this present one because there mom would see patient die every day beside she and that would be really despirite for hera true but what they dona t know is that even at this present department patient die almost every other day maybe because they get the same treatment a mom or simply because cancer is such a deadly disease ia m the one who spend the whole day there and i see everything that go on around there not her sibling they her sibling also say that they think this seduction i wa write about may be a part of ease her pain that wa their explanation so they want mom to stay where shea s now because they say now shea s get a friendly roommate who can help she call the nurse when need but at the chronic department every patient is basically die and they cana t help each other and they also tell i that when the time come for the pulmonary department to send mom to the department of the terminally ill they want to pay so that mom could still stay at the pulm dept until the day she die because they think ita s a much well place and her sibling are legally a close relative of she than i am if ia m righta so legally thata s just 2 against 1 so ia m just start to feel hopeless about i ever being able to win against they and bring mom to my town and moma s brother is even a judge and lawyer soa but all i know is that i take my mother there 3 week ago and even then she could walk with aid we have some nice chat she wa read the paper she wa curious about what wa happen in the world she make friend with her roommate and then a few day later they start to apply those sedative and since then it is only an almost totally unconscious body ia m visit 4 day a week ia m just sit beside her bed all day and shea s lie there and sometimes reach out her arm towards i to indicate that she want to sit up in the bed and then i help she but we cana t really talk to each other and then when finally her mind start to clear and she start to talk the nurse come and a mutea she again with that junk and i just dona t know whether there is still a clear sane or an insane mind behind the sedative and if she really go insane by now is that because it would happen anyway or the sedative cause something adverse and irreversible so yeah if shea s really insane then i would say that a okay leta s keep she where shea s now because ita s all the same for she whether shea s here or in another citya but if shea s still sane and would be her normal self again if they stop sedate she then i would just like to help her escape from there or even take care of herself at home myself although i know that it would be really hard but hey that wa what i wa do until 3 week ago anyway and i wa able to manage it somehow so what do you think about this situation what can a 24 year old girl i do when she and her moma s got leave no one but each other to trust my father die grandparent die ia m her only child and her sibling are against our plan and we just want to be together in the sense of both geographically and spiritually close do you think it is possible to come back from such a mental state and regain her normal self state what do you think would be good for she leave she alone and not disturb she with the transportation to another city because it may increase her physical pain or would even kill she or try to do anything thata s possible to save she from the mental stupor shea s in now these are just some question that come to my mind presently but ia d really welcome any advice on any aspect of the situation thank in advance bogi,negative,negative

i have read a lot of discussion about smoking being a factor for develop lung cancer and also not being one and their thought towards it i agree that smoking for the most part is not the wise of idea if your wanting to lead a healthy life i do not agree with the fact that it cause it since i know too many people that have smoke many year and never develop lung cancer i believe that it is cause from a breakdown in the immune system where essential vitamin are lose or need and of course gene that are pas down to we it seem by now that they could detect these gene and also give something to people especially over the age of 50 to strengthen the immune system and make good cell strong to fight the bad cell that spread cancer my mom do develop lung cancer and do smoke so she do fall under that stereotype of lung cancer but there are very many that never have without cigarette my mom would of been miserable in her later day because that is all she have since she wa a widow by 7 year when she past away and they comfort she and relax she and she enjoy it very much by the way she have degenerative bone disease since her early twenty and have always suffer with bone pain for many year she also become diabetic in her 50 so i have to think that just possibly the cancer come from some of those factor since i see a lot of people have diabete and then cancer i have read an article about cancer and it state that cancer cell love sugar so you should really watch your sugar intake i am glad my mom have her cigarette because they were like a good friend to she and she would of been miserable without in her final month so i do not blame she for that at all or the cigarette a i mention too many people who do not smoke or drink develop cancer a my mother in law even do and die at the age of 53 like her father who do not smoke and it wa determined that it wa an aggressive genetic cancer now we have to worry about my husband and our child whom it would not matter what they do because his mom eat very healthy and do not have bad habit i guess my message is that you should do what make you happy and try to limit some of the bad of course but just be comfortable in what you are do because life can be too short to do without and my mom die do what she love and i would not have it any other way and good for she we love you mom i think you should just do what ever make you feel good because in the end it would not matter because what go to happen will happen and that is that it is aggravating but i really am start to believe 100 in that i also do not like the way people who develop lung cancer are treat by some and especially doctor do not blame yourself for this disease just because it is call lung cancer my heart go out to all of you suffer with this disease good luck and good wish for success,positive,positive

vitamin e may be of help in common liver disease over the year the medicinal quality of vitamin e have been both praise and criticize for decade there have been a debate whether this vitamin could prevent cancer or heart disease large study have pretty much determine that cancer and heart disease do not respond to vitamin e supplementation for that reason many physician incorrectly believe that vitamin e treatment is worthless for any purpose for example a recent study in the new england of medicine have show vitamin e to be of great use in the treatment of a common liver disease result from fat accumulation in the liver steatosis the liver normally store some fat but in excess it can lead to inflammation of the liver a condition call steatohepatitis in up to 15 of those with steatohepatitis cirrhosis and liver failure can result steatohepatitis itself is relatively common in my endocrinology practice several patient per day show evidence of this liver disease manifest a abnormality on routine liver blood test patient most likely to show characteristic abnormality on liver blood test are those with high cholesterol particularly if take the cholesterol lower medication know a statin diabetes and obesity if the blood test are particularly abnormal an ultrasound of the liver is usually obtain to be sure nothing else is occur such a liver cancer or cirrhosis simple steatosis itself is generally easy to diagnose on the ultrasound a recent study in the new england journal of medicine volume 362 no 18 demonstrate that vitamin e is beneficial for treat steatohepatitis 247 subject with evidence of steatohepatitis not due to alcohol use or diabetes were give various treatment the group get 800 iu vitamin e per day show a 43 improvement in measure of steatohepatitis also examine a a possible treatment for steatohepatitis wa actos pioglitazone a popular diabetes drug although the result with actos were promise they were not a good a the result with vitamin e a always the researcher conclude that further study will be need to confirm this benefit before use vitamin e in your own program be sure to check with your physician first vitamin e can act like a blood thin so it use in people who have bleed abnormality or on drug that influence blood clotting is of particular concern this article is for educational purpose only and is not intend a medical advice the disclaimer for metabolism com apply to this and all my post gary pepper m d editor in chief metabolism com one response to common liver disease respond to vitamin e 1 clinical nutritionist on may 18th 2010 at 9 20 prime minister hi i d like to add a few more important point about vitamin e vitamin e in it natural state is actually 8 different compound tocopherol and tocotrienol many of the medical clinical study only use alpha tocopherol and often they use the inferior synthetic version dl alpha tocopherol so realistically vitamin have not been study adequately or appropriately the word tocopherol in greek translate into to bring forth offspring and we know vitamin e is important in fertility it is also of primary importance in prevent oxidation of cholesterol and also the fatty acid in cell membrane vitamin e also regenerate vitamin c and therefore is crucial to our antioxidant status so there is a little tidbit about vitamin e more to come later beth ellen diluglio miss rd cnsd ccn ld and,neutral,neutral

http healthyhepper com warning htm thing you need to know if you have hepatitis c or any liver disease 1 hcv threat from the ocean people with hcv should be aware of a bacteria call v vulnificus find in the gulf of mexico and other warm water it infect oyster and other shellfish pollution is not what cause the contamination in the shellfish so just avoid contaminate water is not enough of a precaution this bacteria can be in raw or undercooked fish but get this it is not enough for those with hcv to just avoid oyster sushi and lightly cook shellfish some of my personal favorite but this bacteria can infect open wound when a person go swimming in infect water humor okay so like my vacation i wa plan in the gulf of mexico where i wade in the warm water after savor a raw oyster in my bloody mary and down a few deep fried shrimp and a double chocolate cheesecake is out doc bummer i am like so bum out dude i have hep c i have to find out what the other pleasure are in life right 2 hepatitis c re infection a if one dose of this virus is not enough usually we think about virus well i have have it so i can not get it again not in the case with hcv hepatitis c folk you can be re infect with the virus there are different genotype and you can even be re infect with the same genotype you already have is not that special no but in all seriousness if you become infected with hcv because of risky behavior or lifestyle use illegal drug and so on by all mean stop do not think well i already have it so what s the use or i already have hep c so what s get a tattoo go to do of course you want to take all precaution not to spread the disease but you also want to take these precaution for yourself the center for disease control state prior infection of hcv do not protect against re infection with the same or different genotype of the virus the point is no matter how you get the virus you must protect yourself a well a other from infection 3 raw shellfish for those with hcv no way eat raw or undercooked shellfish yes even from the ocean can be a serious danger and even cause death especially in people with liver disease a warning from a posting in the hepc bull comply by joan king on thehepcbc website the fda issue an advisory warning to high risk individual that would be we with chronic liver disease or weaken immune system urge they to avoid eat raw or partially cook oyster however the good news is you can eat shellfish cook however it is important to note that it is advise for people with hemochromatosis a condition involve iron overload are advise to avoid shellfish oyster completely due to iron in they see my special report on iron overload 4 hav vaccine get it hepatitis a and hepatitis c do not mix hepatitis a hav is not ordinarily a lethal disease although it can in some rare case cuase liver failure but if you already have hepatitis c hcv then hav can be deadly accord to an article by dan oneill hepatitis a and hepatitis c do not mix source it is highly recommend by many doctor to get the hav vaccine 5 vitamin a and hcv most source i look up about vitamin a say that excess vitamin a can be very toxic to the liver prescription for nutritional healing by james f balch m d say excessive amount of vitamin a over long period may cause liver enzyme to be elevate when ask my doctor what too much vitamin a would be he tell i meagadose beyond what any multivitamin would contain james f balch suggest anyone take over 50 000 international unit a vitamin a daily for over a year should reduce his or her intake or switch to natural beta carotene which should not have any side effect the typical dose in a multivitamin is 25 000 ius 6 mold aflatoxin and peanut do not mix with hcv to make a long and boring story short an aflatotoxin is a mold these are substance that grow on certain food especially nut peanut store in hot and humid condition are especially prone to this this is one reason why some nutritionist advise hepatitis patient to avoid all nut mostly i have hear that peanut are to be avoid matthew dolan in his book the hepatitis c handbook write although many nutritionist appear to be unaware of the severe risk pose by aflatoxin in the diet particularly people who already have liver disease aflatotoxin are a definite dietary cofactor in the development of liver cancer he continue by explain that they are carcinogenic and they are a particular problem in peanut sum it up avoid all food that might potentially contain any trace of aflatoxin peanut food that have low level of it may not be a danger to the general population but they may present a small risk a cofactor to hcv in trigger the development of liver cancer and if you do eat nut do not eat discolor or damage nut of any kind or one that have been leave uncover for long period of time store they in a cool dry place to avoid contamination 7 mix alcohol pain reliever alcohol is a no no for your liver acetominophen aspirin paracetamol and ibuprofen can all be liver toxic and a have an impact on liver function the fda warn and require warning on over the counter pain reliever about the danger of mix alcohol and these various medication the combination can cause damage to the liver of people who do not have hep c so image what it can do to people who do have a chronic liver disease here is a simplistic but accurate conclusion alcohol is bad drug are bad mix they is really bad for those with hcv i could give you a bunch of scientific evidence and article and source but you do not need they for the general purpose here which is just to avoid what hurt you 8 aspirin acetaminophen ibuprofen paracetamol all these over the counter drug can have impact on liver function and potentially cause liver damage it is advise to not take any of these unless absolutely necessary persistent long tern use in contraindicate for people with hepatitis c if you have a condition that involve chronic pain and need a pain reliever on a regular basis it is good to consult your doctor about what would be safe in the hepatitis c help book by misha ruth cohen and robert gish it is advise although high dose of acetaminophen can be toxic to the liver it is still the safe pain remedy available if take in dose of le than 2 gram a day acetaminophen is tylenol,neutral,neutral

it is complicate by jodi scott 2 hour ago it always is when it come to elinor health but a her oncologist say today you re not average but no one is so let we start from top to bottom cover the ct scan a we do with the doctor the lung were clear the clot are still there but small but they do not see the nodule that wa previously there the liver tumor are all small some much small the previously 5 cm pancreatic mass is now 2 9 cm she do have some ascite which is an accumulation of fluid in the abdoman make by the cancer cell this is contribute to she bloat and fullness the red herring is the ovary both ovary have increase in size the left is just cystic and likely benign the right ovary is now 11 6 cm and complex appear so what do this mean that is the million dollar question it could represent a mixed response to chemotherapy some of the pancreatic cancer is respond and some is not or this could mean a second process possibly something call a borderline ovarian tumor which mean it can behave like a malignant tumor but is usually much slow grow or much le likely a second ovarian primary cancer the only definitive way to answer this question is with surgery the issue with that blood thinner and chemotherapy we would have to stop the lovenox which would risk a recurrence of a pulmonary embolus blood clot in the lung and we would have to stop chemotherapy for at least 3 week which would not be the end of the world but i would really prefer not to do that since were see a response so in the end we all agree to proceed with a paracentesis a the next step so we will go into radiology tomorrow morning and they will drain off the ascite in the abdomen through a very small needle this provide 2 benefit first it will hopefully help improve the bloating and fullness second they will send the fluid to lab to see if there is any way to determine what type of cell are in the ascite probably not high yield but worth send elinor also have an mri to re evaluate the lesion on her sacrum that wa discover on an mri do on 12 26 13 this have grow slightly but do not change the plan in any way follow the doctor appointment we proceed with chemotherapy a plan elinor will have tumor marker draw every 2 week and scan repeat in 8 week they will follow a ca 125 which is a tumor marker that can be associate with ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumor other thing can make this elevate so it is not highly specific but the general trend may give we some answer she ca 19 9 which is the tumor marker we are follow for the pancreatic cancer have drop over time and wa down to 28 000 on february 26th she have one draw today but we would not get those result back until thursday or friday now well move on to the mg neurology talk for all of you out there whom elinor so gratefully rely upon for support after do some investigate i personally in my ob gyn opinion wink wink think it is more likely that elinor have lem lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome which is highly associate with a malignancy and her symptom just seem to fit this pattern well than mg we ask elinor oncologist if he could order a voltage gate calcium channel antibody which can help diagnose this and he wa more than happy to add this on to her other lab work it would be silly not to this is not always positive in lem but if it is then that is a slam dunk we can ask the neurologist for 3 4 diaminopyridine 3 4 dap which should improve her symptom for muscle weakness well than the mestinon alone now well move on to the running talk for all of her run family cheerleader and fan she have hear back from the race director of the boston mararthon and the board say yes to let she run walk just the last mile now security and the boston police department have to ok it finger and toe cross today the woman sit next to my sister in the infusion center overhear we talk and turn and say that wa you in that interview when i see that i wa cheer you on she wish my sister luck and tell she she wa out there run for a lot of people with cancer that she have a huge group behind her elinor reply i will run for everyone who sit in one of these chair i will provide a link to the interview that she and martha do with wcco neither one of they have watch it but the rest of we are very proud of their grace feel free to share it like it on facebook tweet it anything to get the word out there http minnesota cbslocal com 2014 03 10 woman aim to finish boston marathon despite pancreatic can wowza that wa a long update i do not think i have anything else to add except my final thought we can not possibly say it enough we appreciate you each and every one of you we appreciate the warm thought the kind word act of kindness the prayer the support the love everything it mean more than anyone could possibly imagine we use it to lift ourselves up in the darkest moment and make our bright moment even brighter thank you,neutral,neutral
ok so i talk to my bone marrow transplant doctor today about collect the baby umbilical cord for stem cell he say that it really is not that effective for anyone that is have just one baby in all likelihood they would not be use for the same child even if they were to develop leukemia they look at the national marrow registry but he do say that with all the advance in technology that it could someday change he do say that if there is any kind of familial disease that could be treat with a stem cell transplant you never know what the future may hold if you have more then one child he do recommend it i specifically ask he if use an egg donor change anything he say no not really but if money is not an issue he say that it could be a wise choice so now i stand undecided money really is not too much of an issue especially when i think what the future may hold i obviously am alive because of a stem cell transplant from my brother heaven forbid my child ever develop cancer some degenerative disease or even a spinal cord injury medicine advance every day it could save their life so even a doctor that specialize in stem cell transplant say umbilical cord preservation have it pro con i guess it turn out to be a personal choice is it worth the money could it actually be useful in the future could medicine advance enough in our child lifetime to make it worth while at this point i want to say yes i am think hard seriously about this one i hope this give you each something to think about,negative,negative

wa diagnose with cancer on the friday and move to a hospice and die on the follow tuesday the pain i am feel is almost unbearable for many reason which i hope you will not judge i for i begin work with s almost a year ago and we become close friend very quickly there wa an amazing connection and we just love being in each other company a time go by we get close and i find myself talk about he outside work we would often be in contact in the evening and the weekend and he quickly become my good friend rather than being my colleague and bos i think i need to tell you now that i am openly gay

although i feel the same i try to fight the attraction a i know he have a family but with we spend so much time together it wa impossible he never want to hurt his family but he tell i how much he care for i and want we to have a future together he torture himself through christmas and agonise about what he should do next during december he wa also lose weight and have some stomach pain but i think he and i just put this down to the stress of the situation in january he tell i he want to be with i but feel that he need to give it one last try with his wife so that he could look at his child in the future and tell they he try he want to do the right thing which i understand i love he and understand this although at the time i wa quite distant a i wa hurt a few day later he get some test result from the gp that indicate the possibility of a secondary cancer on his liver when he tell i we do not mention our relationship but just focusse on get his diagnosis treatment and how i would do everything i could to support he through his illness two week later he wa admit to hospital he would been wait 2 week for a referral for mri scan with stomach pain after he leave work i visit he once in hospital he would visibly lose weight and i have to help he sit up in bed which shock i we talk about mundane stuff i do not say anything about how much i love he or how much he mean to i i do not want he to know how worried i wa or for he to think or even consider he might die which i think he would if i would tell he i love he a if i wa say goodbye in the last few week s buy i a key ring with a map of the town i am buy my first flat in on he wa very excited for i he also text i to give i his favourite book that wa on his book shelf at work follow this he have two week of test which initially prove inconclusive but cancer wa then diagnose s have keep in contact via text throughout but do not tell i how serious thing were just that he wa have a couple of hard day that his dad wa stay with he and that i should not worry his wife contact work two day after his last text to i to say he would passed away from a very aggressive cancer my world have been turn upside down although nothing wa for sure i would dreamt of a potential future we might have together the guilt i have feel over what have happen and the question s wife may have have over his change in behaviour over the last few month have also been a concern despite the fact that i am not ashamed over what happen it would serve no purpose for she to find out what happen i have have to tell a few friend to help they understand what i am go through i am in agony work have been utterly horrendous though s run my division and i am now in charge i love work because of he and i am not ready to lead the team or feel in any position to do this because of the grief and turmoil i am go to i have never really have to deal with bereavement before but i think i could have deal with lose someone i love but lose someone i am in love with seem like the bad thing that could have ever happen the feeling of loss and the wondering of what could have been are unbearable i can not understand why these thing happen and can not understand what high force would allow this to happen i am not religious and neither wa s but do not believe that religion could be of any comfort during this time i feel guilty about the pain i am go though a it can not even compare to the pain his wife and child are go through or his parent i do not feel i am entitle to any legitimate feeling of grief i am almost start to feel that i do not care about my life if i die tomorrow next week next year it do not matter i keep wonder what happen when we die i worry that he wa in pain and that he wa scared and i could not help he i wa not there i attend the funeral last week which wa very hard and i cry throughout people know i am struggle at the loss of a friend but they do not know the extent of how much i am suffer i do not know

impossible i speak to s dad at the funeral and he wa lovely say he would heard a lot about i i can not sleep and am have nightmare all the time he truly wa a beautiful man i love and i can not bare to

i hope this answer everyone question about this serious disease i have late stage fibrosis due to this complication i know nothing about until i have my biospy nonalcoholic steatohepatitison this page diagnosis symptom cause treatment hope through research point to remember for more information nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or nash is a common often silent liver disease it resemble alcoholic liver disease but occur in people who drink little or no alcohol the major feature in nash is fat in the liver along with inflammation and damage most people with nash feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem nevertheless nash can be severe and can lead to cirrhosis in which the liver is permanently damage and scarred and no long able to work properly nash affect 2 to 5 percent of american an additional 10 to 20 percent of american have fat in their liver but no inflammation or liver damage a condition call fatty liver although have fat in the liver is not normal by itself it probably cause little harm or permanent damage if fat is suspect base on blood test result or scan of the liver this problem is call nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld if a liver biopsy is perform in this case it will show that some people have nash while other have simple fatty liver both nash and nafld are become more common possibly because of the great number of american with obesity in the past 10 year the rate of obesity have double in adult and triple in child obesity also contribute to diabete and high blood cholesterol which can far complicate the health of someone with nash diabetes and high blood cholesterol are also become more common among american biliary system top diagnosisnash is usually first suspect in a person who is find to have elevation in liver test that are include in routine blood test panel such a alanine aminotransferase alt or aspartate aminotransferase ast when further evaluation show no apparent reason for liver disease such a medication viral hepatitis or excessive use of alcohol and when x ray or image study of the liver show fat nash is suspect the only mean of prove a diagnosis of nash and separate it from simple fatty liver is a liver biopsy for a liver biopsy a needle is insert through the skin to remove a small piece of the liver nash is diagnose when examination of the tissue with a microscope show fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cell if the tissue show fat without inflammation and damage simple fatty liver or nafld is diagnose an important piece of information learn from the biopsy is whether scar tissue have develop in the liver currently no blood test or scan can reliably provide this information liver biopsy top symptomsnash is usually a silent disease with few or no symptom patient generally feel well in the early stage and only begin to have symptomssuch a fatigue weight loss and weaknessonce the disease is more advanced or cirrhosis develop the progression of nash can take year even decade the process can stop and in some case reverse on it own without specific therapy or nash can slowly worsen cause scarring or fibrosis to appear and accumulate in the liver a fibrosis worsens cirrhosis develop the liver become seriously scarred hardened and unable to function normally not every person with nash develop cirrhosis but once serious scarring or cirrhosis is present few treatment can halt the progression a person with cirrhosis experience fluid retention muscle waste bleed from the intestine and liver failure liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis with liver failure and transplantation is increasingly perform in people with nash nash rank a one of the major cause of cirrhosis in america behind hepatitis c and alcoholic liver disease stage of liver damage top causesalthough nash have become more common it underlying cause is still not clear it most often occur in person who are middle aged and overweight or obese many patient with nash have elevate blood lipid such a cholesterol and triglyceride and many have diabete or pre diabete but not every obese person or every patient with diabetes have nash furthermore some patient with nash are not obese do not have diabete and have normal blood cholesterol and lipid nash can occur without any apparent risk factor and can even occur in child thus nash is not simply obesity that affect the liver while the underlying reason for the liver injury that cause nash is not know several factor are possible candidate insulin resistance release of toxic inflammatory protein by fat cell cytokine oxidative stress deterioration of cell inside liver cell top treatmentcurrently no specific therapy for nash exist the most important recommendation give to person with this disease are to reduce their weight if obese or overweight follow a balanced and healthy diet increase physical activity avoid alcohol avoid unnecessary medication these are standard recommendation but they can make a difference they are also helpful for other condition such a heart disease diabete and high cholesterol a major attempt should be make to lower body weight into the healthy range weight loss can improve liver test in patient with nash and may reverse the disease to some extent research at present is focus on how much weight loss improve the liver in patient with nash and whether this improvement last over a period of time people with nash often have other medical condition such a diabetes high blood pressure or elevate cholesterol these condition should be treat with medication and adequately control have nash or elevated liver enzyme should not lead people to avoid treat these other condition experimental approach under evaluation in patient with nash include antioxidant such a vitamin e selenium and betaine these medication act by reduce the oxidative stress that appear to increase inside the liver in patient with nash whether these substance actually help treat the disease is not know but the result of clinical trial should become available in the next few year another experimental approach to treat nash is the use of new antidiabetic medicationseven in person without diabete most patient with nash have insulin resistance mean that the insulin normally present in the bloodstream is le effective for they in control blood glucose and fatty acid in the blood than it is for people who do not have nash the new antidiabetic medication make the body more sensitive to insulin and may help reduce liver injury in patient with nash study of these medicationsinclude metformin rosiglitazone and pioglitazoneare being sponsor by the national institute of health and should answer the question of whether these medication are beneficial in nash top hope through researchwhat is most need in the management of nash is more research to well understand the liver injury find in this disease when the pathway that lead to the injury are fully know safe and effective mean can be develop to reverse these pathway and help patient with nash recent breakthrough in map the human genome and uncover the individual step by which insulin and other hormone regulate blood glucose and fat could provide the necessary clue the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney disease fund the nash clinical research network which comprise eight clinical center locate throughout the united state and a coordinate center at john hopkins university the nash network research the nature and underlying cause of nash and conduct clinical study on prevention and treatment more information on the nash clinical research network and the location of the clinical center are available at www jhucct com nash top point to remember nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash is fat in the liver with inflammation and damage nash occur in people who drink little or no alcohol and affect 2 to 5 percent of american especially people who are middle aged and overweight or obese nash can occur in child people who have nash may feel well and may not know that they have a liver disease nash can lead to cirrhosis a condition in which the liver is permanently damage and can not work properly fatigue can occur at any stage of nash weight loss and weakness may begin once the disease is advanced or cirrhosis is present nash may be suspect if blood test show high level of liver enzyme or if scan show fatty liver nash is diagnose by examine a small piece of the liver take through a needle a procedure call biopsy people who have nash should reduce their weight eat a balanced diet engage in physical activity and avoid alcohol and unnecessary medication no specific therapy for nash exist experimental therapy being study include antioxidant and

i have been read another book this summer i think i would share some point from it at the senate select subcommittee hearing on cancer research 1946 all five doctor state one therapy have surprise and encourage by the result one doctor state relief of severe pain wa achieve in about 90 percent of case for cancer however since much of the inflammation is trigger in the gut and this can lead to pain i wonder if it would work for other type of pain this therapy state to have the follow benefit dilate blood vessel and counter inflammation of the gut palmitate enhance glutatuione s transferase i huge antioxidant remove toxic radical from blood stimulate the visceral nervous system promote peristalsis i muscle movement in intestine that push out poop and the transit of diluted toxic bile from the duodenum out the rectum since the therapy take 15 minute and the blood in the body pas through the liver nearly every three minute it is a form of dialysis of blood across the gut wall improve cell potassium k while decrease salt therefore reduce swelling of cell that can damage it increase mitochondrion count and activity so what is this therapy something i have read other doctor have do for about 3 year however none state what benefit there are and what mechanism by which it act i wonder about the safety of it i speak to an rn over a year ago and she state that they use to put this therapy in manual give to nurse but well over a decade ago it wa take out so it wa safe it is a coffee enema hold for 15 minute and then evacuate out so i bite the bullet buy the enema bag online and do it to see if it would help i since i have uc of colon inflammation and yeast over growth that release toxin liver have to deal with honestly i lay on the floor the first minute i have to evacuate then i continue with the rest of the 15 minute however you know i do feel well i just think i would share this information if you want a good read it is call the gerson therapy i think ezone mention it i am reference page 162 169,neutral,neutral

cirrhosis result from the necrosis of the liver cell it is characterize by fibrosis formation of scar tissue and regenerative nodule the disease of cirrhosis and it stage lead to some or complete loss of liver function it may occur at any age of life cause of cirrhosis cirrhosis is most commonly cause by extensive and excessive drinking of alcohol there are other cause which include postnecrotic cirrhosis hepatitis b hepatitis c non alcoholic fatty liver disease autoimmune disease primary sclerose cholingitis stage of the liver disease cirrhosis autommune hepatitis metabolic disorder hemochromatosis wilson disease alpha antitrypsin defeciency galactosemia biliary primary biliary cirrhosis secondary biliary cirrhosis cystic fibrosis genetic hemochromatosis wilson disease chronic venous outflow obstruction budd chiari syndrome pathology of cirrhosis liver cirrhosis is characterize by the formation of regenerative nodule with loss of normal structure there are three type of cirrhosis a micronodular cirrhosis in this type the whole of the liver is uniformly involved regenerative nodule are on the small side being le than 3 mm in size this is due to excessive alcohol consumption b macronodular cirrhosis in this type some section of the liver are normal the size of the nodule will be variable and this type of cirrhosis is see in chronic viral hepatitis c mixed cirrhosis in some case a mixture of both small and large nodule are visible on and through the liver there are 4 stage of liver cirrhosis knowledge about the stage of liver cirrhosis is important for well prevention early diagnosis and effective preventative treatment stage 1 is the early stage which is characterize by minimal damage and a good prognosis for recovery and prevention whereas in the final stage 4 the liver is virtually completely damage and a liver transplant is the only treatment of choice read on to find out more about the different stage of cirrhosis stage 1 the first stage is know a the compensate stage this stage is characterize by inflammation of the liver tissue inflammation is confine to the portal area and do not involve other area of the liver this inflammatory process lead to minor connective tissue formation and scarring of the liver but a the name say these change can be compensate for by the body mean the body will adapt to offset the disease effect this stage is usually asymptomatic but on close examination some patient may have mild jaundice fatigue loss of appetite weight loss dry mouth nausea swelling of the abdomen abdominal pain stage 2 the second stage of cirrhosis is also characterize by inflammation of the liver tissue but at this stage the liver start to show area of fibrosis fibrosis are the stiff band that are form by the replacement of normal liver tissue with the scar tissue it is irreversible and can never return back to normal liver tissue however new liver cell can generate in this stage inflammation is not only limit to the portal area but involve the whole liver the change in this stage can be compensate for by the body stage 3 in the third stage the inflammation and fibrosis start to involve other area of the liver and the condition become more severe a the fibrosis extend to the other tissue it form bridge fibrosis bridging fibrosis not only impair the normal functioning of the liver but also affect the blood pressure level in the liver a condition know a portal hypertension a patient with stage 3 cirrhosis will not be able to digest fat so he may present with fat soluble vitamin deficiency vitamin a d e and k stage 4 stage 4 of liver cirrhosis is also know a the decompensate stage or end stage liver disease esld it is the most advanced stage and in this stage the body can no long compensate for the damage liver fibrosis extend to every part of the liver and a liver transplant is need to save the patient life stage 4 may also involve the spleen and kidney a patient with the 4th stage of liver cirrhosis may develop the follow symptom in addition to the symptom of the 1st stage fever pedal edema ascite jaundice pruriti plamar erythema easy bruise bleed stage 4 liver cirrhosis increase the risk of many complication e g ascite variceal hemorrhage spontaneous bacterial peritonitis hepatic encephalopathy and liver cancer some of these complication can be life threaten investigation of cirrhosis the follow test are perform to check which stage and what type of liver cirrhosis the patient may have liver function test albumin prothrombin time liver biochemistry serum alkaline phosphatase serum aminotransferase serum electrolyte sodium level serum creatinine viral marker serum autoantibody serum immunoglobulin iron index and ferritin copper ceruloplastin alpha antitrypsin in addition to these laboratory investigation imaging study check for the change in the size and shape of the liver some of these include ultrasound ct scan endoscopy and mri scan a liver biopsy is usually necessary to confirm the type and severity of liver disease management of cirrhosis of the liver in the compensated stage treatment of the underlying cause of cirrhosis can reverse the cirrhotic change in the liver if catch early enough and patient can lead a normal life patient should reduce their salt intake and should avoid aspirin nsaid and alcohol in the de compensate stage management of complication should be do ultrasound test should be do after every 6 month to detect the early development of hepatocellular carcinoma a liver transplant is usually need in the 4th stage prognosis of cirrhosis in general the survival rate of cirrhosis is 50 but this vary with the etiology stage and presence of complication much can be do through early intervention and look at lifestyle factor such a the food you eat and follow a strict liver friendly diet complimentary medicine no alcohol exercise supplement to boost your whole system and especially take care to look after yourself on every level when you have cirrhosis of the liver please use this a you wish i post this because i notice that there is some confusion in this forum regard the progressive stage and treatment available a well especially certain diet that are helpful in prevent the liver from progress to rapidly from one stage to the next which is the key to survive and avoid the decompensate stage 4 where only a transplant can treat such a damage liver for now one day this may change for the well but until then the good we can do is to stop it is progression and aid in regenerate new liver cell which if do efficiently enough can promote improvement in liver function all the good to you bless you all peace,neutral,neutral

http www emaxhealth com 2 39 32952 how hepatitis c virus remain body html a study publish in the proceeding of the national academy of science pnas show that the virus block the action of a specific ion channel in the cell membrane that would usually trigger apoptosis the cell self destruct programme and in do so have evolve another way of protect itself from being eliminate from the body apoptosis occur naturally in the body to allow the removal of unhealthy cell or the replacement of worn out cell one of the way in which apoptosis can be trigger in a cell is to reduce it potassium level this can happen when the cell is expose to oxidative stress that activate a specific ion channel which act a a pore in the cell membrane cause it to open and allow out potassium ion however the research team have discover that a protein make by hcv know a ns5a is able to block the activation of this ion channel in liver cell enable these cell to resist cell death for long for a virus to persist in the body over a long time it have to find a way of manipulate the host cell so that it become resistant to apoptosis say lead researcher professor mark harris of the university faculty of biological science we know of many way that virus have evolve to do this but this is the first observation of a virus prevent cell death by manipulate an ion channel hcv affect some 170 million people globally and only around half of these will respond to treatment many sufferer will be asymptomatic some for twenty or even thirty year but the virus remain in the liver and it long tem damage can ultimately cause cirrhosis or cancer cell in the liver are often expose to high level of oxidative and other stress a they work to detoxify the blood of foreign compound such a drug and alcohol and to remove chemical produce by our own body say professor harris in addition the virus itself cause oxidative stress a it replicate in the cell the research show that the virus have evolve another way of protect itself from this natural process and to avoid elimination from the body for long the research team believe that continue research may offer a potential target for drug development perhaps through combination therapy we need to find out exactly how the block action work but it possible that two drug could be couple together one to prevent the virus from block the ion channel and another to induce stress to force apoptosis say professor harris it a very exciting discovery and ideally we d like to expand our investigation to see whether other virus that cause long term or chronic infection such a hiv have evolve the same ability source university of leed,neutral,neutral

the doctor advise we he could not remove the abnormal polyp before christ of it is size and that laparoscopic surgery is necessary they have to make an incision in his belly open he up do a colon resection and stitch everything my father recently have a colonoscopy do there were 6 small polyp that were easily remove during the colonoscopy but one wa abnormal in size and close to the anus the doctor take a sample of the lesion which will be test for cancer g back up not only do i pray that the lesion is benign but wa hope that laparoscopic surgery could some how be avoid and be do via a colonoscopy i read on the internet rarely a polyp will be too large to remove during colonoscopy which mean that a surgical procedure will be need at a later time i guess my question is what size is consider too large i am hope this doctor is not just eager to use his knife is all and do not want my 64 year old father with diabete to have to go through the recovery stage thank in advance,neutral,neutral

i have never post anything here before but i have often come here to read post and i would like to thank all of you for share your story a they have help i and my family alot i hope that i can bring some hope to all of you my father have nsclc that have spread all over his lung and to the adjacent lymph node numerous chemotherapy help to shrink the tumor but eventually stop work in decemberhe wa put on iressa a a step to merely prolong his life it work great and not only stop the cancer from grow but considerably shrink the tumour along side this he wa also take a number of chinese herbal combination to boost his immune system eventually the iressa stop shrink the tumour and just prevent their growth this wa good enough for we slowly my father start develop some tingle sensation in his leg and foot and have back pain he wa check out and they find a mass of inflammation in his spine the doctor initially think it to be cancer because they do not know what else it could be they decide to radiate the mass and this mean that for three week my father would have to go off of iressa i have do some internet research and find an herbal remedy for cancer call essiac tea i think that we would get he drink it 4 oz twice a day while he wa on radiation because it wa know to be excellent for deal with the side effect of cancer treatment after 3 week the doctor decide to take an x ray of his lung to see how badly the cancer have grow while he wa off the iressa they say not to worry to much a any new growth would be handle by the iressa to everyone surprise the x ray reveal that my father lung were completely clean the are plan still to do a ct scan to double check but nobody can believe what they see on the x ray i do not know if it wa the tea but i do not know what else it could have been the radiation wa point at his throat area not his lung take home message 1 do not believe everything your oncologist tell you a year ago they tell he that he have 2 month to live do your own research and try everything you can the doctor now are say they do not know what s in his spine and the radiation have make it bad if anybody have ever hear of any spine disorder let i know we are still try to understand what this is so while we are happy the cancer is go in his lung we have a new le scary problem to face 2 prayer is important i do not have the space here to discus all the particular but god will guide you to any answer if you ask he to do not concern yourself with which religion to follow they are just tool to uncover god they are not god themselves is the cancer the choice of the god above you or the god within you everything have it purpose when you figure out what that is you will move on take time to expand your mind and enlighten yourself to infinite possibility and understand 3 herbal and natural remedy do work try to find an experienced herbalist to examine you and give you the proper herb give essiac tea a shot it might work for you too i know how hard this can be but do not lose faith my prayer are with you,positive,positive

i know most of we with anxiety also suffer hypochondria which is what start our anxiety anywhoo i come across this story i hope you all enjoy i descend into hypochondria at age 39 when i find a tiny lump in my breast normally i would not have worry my breast are naturally very dense and lumpy and my doctor have never seem concerned but this particular lump appear during the most difficult time of my lifein the midst of watch my father die of cancer right after i find it i go with my family to dad oncologist office where we would find out whether a hellish about of radiation and chemo have kill the cancer grow in dad esophagus while we wait i look at one of those plastic card that explain how to do a breast self exam i wa still hold the card when the doctor come in and clip some x ray to a light board he point to a small dark spot on my father liver the cancer wa spread when i could stop cry i realize i wa still clutch the breast exam card it seem like a sign i go home and google breast lump and what i read make my hand shake and my heart race suddenly i could not think of anything else in the shower at the dinner table drive the kid to school all i could think about wa die after that i really wa sickjust not with cancer hypochondria might seem like a joke a label you pin on a friend whose health drama never amount to anything but like depression or anxiety hypochondria is a recognize psychiatric disorder it affect an estimate 1 to 5 percent of american and like those disorder it exist on a continuum from people who simply worry excessively about their health to those who are completely debilitate by fear true hypochondriac do not just make up fake symptom and imaginary pain in a bid for attention instead every time a genuine symptom appear they believe that something is terribly wrong when a test turn up nothing a hypochondriac worry anyway sure the next test or doctor will uncover a serious or even fatal illness i do not imagine the lump in my breast what make i a hypochondriac is that no reassuring mammogram ultrasound or mri could ever convince i i wa not die after that first panicky google search i go straight to my ob gyns office to get the lump check out a a nurse gently prod and knead i chat with she try to calm myself down i wa probably overreact i say and explain that my fatherthe one person who could make i feel both completely protect and completely sure of my own strengthwas die a close a dad and i were it wa hard to separate what wa happen to he from what wa happen to i the nurse nod kindly then she say oop there s a mass a word like mass have a way of strip all logic from the conversation the nurse say it wa probably nothing but i need a mammogram and an ultrasound to be sure she tell i repeatedly that this mass do not feel like cancer to she that 80 percent of lump even the really suspicious one do not turn out to be cancer that it wa not time to start plan my funeral but to a woman with a mass in her breast and a die father the word funeral work like a dirty bomb explode into fragment that lodge deep in the brain the test only confirm that i have extremely dense breast tissuethe kind that make it nearly impossible for a radiologist to see anything in a mammogram or an ultrasound the next step a biopsy that turn out fine and the cheerful surgeon report that he wa not worried about i at all but then he say i need to return for another ultrasound in three month wa he hide something if there wa nothing amiss why do i need to come back a it turn out dense breast tissue is a risk factor for cancer which is why neither that surgeon nor one i consult for a second opinion would give i an all clear three time that first year i return for schedule exam on two other occasion i show up with new lump i wa worried about every time my test result show nothing wrong but instead of feel relieved i would brood about the cancer in hide the one the doctor do not catch i get so worried i could hardly work i cancel dinner party refuse to plan for the future when decoration go on sale after the holiday i d think i might not live to see next christmas and buy nothing meanwhile my parent come to stay with i and my family so i could help mom care for dad one of my son try to understand his grandfather illness say you are not go to get sick too are you mommy he look up at i trustingly and the fear rise up in my throat so thick i could hardly breathe before long the stress lead to more symptom that seem to warrant follow up insomnia heart palpitation irregular period a constant stomach ache over the next few year i have pelvic ultrasound a colonoscopy an endoscopy a colposcopy an ekg and countless blood testsand nothing wa wrong most of the test i suspect were order by my amazingly patient doctor to quell my fear but the more testing i have the more worried i become good test result were no solace during the three year it take my father to die and the grieve year afterward for people debilitate by hypochondria antidepressant and therapy may help but i never consider these option because like so many hypochondriac i do not realize i wa one what cure i is the fact that i do not die time pas after my father death and i begin to recognize the connection between my fear and my grief over his loss i realize that even if i could not banish that fear entirely i could take step to keep it from spiral out of control eventually i stop think of my body a a time bomb and begin finally to think of it a the very thing that let i live a happy life these day i sleep well and i laugh more checkup still make i nervous but i talk myself out of the tree by remember all the test and biopsy that turn out fine i no long google every little ache and pain because of the inevitable caveat rarely these are also symptom of a more serious condition instead i take a wait and see approach i m more likely to worry if i m exhausted or stress so i get eight hour of sleep and i never skip my workout i have a happy marriage healthy child deep friendship interesting work that s always been trueby themselves such blessing are no protection from hypochondria but i now understand that a constant fear of death is the sure way to ruin my own bless life and in it own way my about with hypochondria have turn out to be a gift the daily irritation that use to drive i to distractiontraffic delay flaky coworker

i have surgery for carcinoid lung cancer almost 3 year ago my right middle lobe wa remove since then they have been monitor my chromagranin a blood level every 90 day after a while of it stay around 3 max is 32 it start to rise it go from 3 3 to 8 to 11 to 13 still normal range but not a good trend my oncologist wa try to get i set up for an octrescan to see where it might be come back they are expensive and medicare do not want to pay for it pet scan are usually useless for find carcinoid i start do some research on the actual carcinoid test itself and find some thing the oncologist do not know turn out that if you are on prilosec it will screw up the result he do not know that and neither do the lab do the test i have been on prilosec for a long time for acid reflux my mom die of esophageal cancer from acid reflux i stop take the prilosec and wait a month for it to clear my system and get the oncologist to repeat the chromagranin a test again this time it wa 4 1 so that mean all the result while i wa on prilosec were useless so now we are basicly start over to get a baseline and so on i guess the moral of the story is do not trust the doc or the lab to know all the interaction and if you are get lab result that are disturb do some research on your own to make sure something else is not affect the result dave,negative,neutral

greeting and blessing to all today i celebrate my 5 year since diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia who celebrate being diagnose with aml or any cancer for that matter but leta s be honest in the cancer lottery aml is not one of the preferred at least if you cling to cancer stat which is something i highly discourage first problem with aml stat specifically the mean dx age of 68ish i have spend substantial time around several aml support group and i routinely meet people in their 50 40 30 and 20 stricken with this demon an amazing christian brother of mine who also is a physician recommend i read an article on cancer stat that i re read often the median is not the messagea i highly recommend it http www cancerguide org mediannotmsg html so back to my celebration first thing you must know about i i am an on fire bible believing sell out save by grace forgive sinner second i absolutely do not believe god give i cancer because nothing bad and i believe all of we know cancer to be very very bad come from a love gracious merciful god such a ours nor is cancer some sort of evil test where god is test i or try to prove my strength for i firmly believe 2 corinthian 12 9 my grace is all you need my power work well in weakness so now i am glad to boast about my weakness so that the power of christ can work through i fight cancer certainly do not show i how strong i am wa the opposite occur for the first time in my adult life i wa completely out of control helpless feckless a powerless a a new bear babe and in that lay bare state for the first time in my life i completely surrender my life my will my future my child over to almighty god and he wa and is faithful i truly leave the peace that pas all understanding like a blanket of comfort on my darkest day that act of surrender and blind faith change my relationship with my lord and savior forever and i will never be the same that is what i celebrate five year ago i wa an otherwise healthy 48 year old mother of three amazing daughter 8 10 and 12 married to the love of my life i work full time for the u air force a a civilian manager and teach mastera s level graduate course part time primarily online i have absolutely no symptom at dx other than a few bruise very typical for i and a very wonky cbc that wa do a part of routine blood work at dx my platelet were 98 wbc wa 1ish and my anc wa 02 and have been there for month i would discover later like most of you i wa refer to a hematologist who base on the cbc and the fact that i have not have any illness to include a cold for year do not think a i have anything to worry abouta but just to be safe go get a bmb to rule anything out 12 hour later i wa admit to the hospital with confirm aml with the dreaded 7 3 red devil chemo drip into my hickman six hour later i wa bless with an amazing medical team at lds hospital in slc ut lead by the amazing finn peterson from denmark who have been specialize in acute leukemia for 30 year he immediately see the shock an awe in my eye and graciously prescribe anti depressant and anti anxiety med that help i so much during my year of chemo dr peterson do an amazing job literally draw on my stainless board in my room cytogenetic component of aml because my very first question wa is aml hereditary with thought of my precious daughter he confirm not hereditary but certainly genetic wait what he ask about exposure to benzene and explain that people around military installation yep 30 year of that and those expose to secondary smoke yep both parent chain smoker have high chance of blood cancer by the way my brother wa dxd with nhl about a year after i so back to my previous comment about cancera s cause yes i believe there is an environmental causation and possibly hereditary for some type but i do think most cancer are random a discus in the johna s hopkin study http hub jhu edu 2017 03 23 cancer mutation cause by random dna mistake and whenever i would start down a pity party about a why mea relative to cancer my mind would always go to child stricken with this disease a adult we can be reason with make to understand why this procedure bmb is necessary but a child good lord how heart wrench that must be my advice to any adult do the why i business go volunteer in a childrena s cancer ward that syndrome will be cure forever he far explain the three category of aml favorable intermediate and unfavorable if i wa in the favorable category i may be able to be treat with chemo only otherwise stem cell transplant wa the treatment path he promise i would know my sub type and any mutation flt3 cebpa ect within two week but job one wa to get i into remission fortunately i tolerate the induction chemo well with only slight mucositis and no other complication not even a fever i manage to walk 3 to 4 mile everyday whether i want to or not a promise 2 week in i wa overjoyed to learn i have inversion 16 with no mutation chemo only for i i spend 28 day in the hospital and send home to return in four week to begin consolidation now this is where my smooth cancer journey go somewhat off the track but i share it in case other have or will experience this

it sound like there are many bowel colon disorder that present with similar symptom i am a 51 yr old male 40 pound overweight do not smoke or drink yesterday i again have bright red blood on my stool and dripping in the water this have been occur for a number of year now and doctor have tell i it wa hemmeroid but i am go in for a check up today 4 week ago i have severe pain in my low left abdomen the doctor could not even touch my belly without tenderness severe pain go to the emergency room for a ct scan check for diverticulitis i believe and the er doc say everything look normal bloodwork wa also normal whatever that mean however the dull pain in my low left abdomen have remain off on for the past 4 week my bowel movement have been loose to runny and sometimes thin than usual i have been go 3 4 time a day and i seem to have gas more than normal these are what have have i worried since these are all symptom of colon cancer question would a tumor in my colon have show up on the ct scan i have read where polyp might be difficult to see if the proper colon prep cleansing wa not do prior to the ct but you would think a tumor cancer would have been visible correct also would the blood test have show anything what in the blood test would they have been look for to rule out anything bad i have a colonoscopy do 5 6 year ago and everything wa clean no polyp i think that 5 10 year is what it take for polyp to grow and turn cancerous so if i wa clean back in 2002 2003 is colon cancer unlikely either way i want to get another colonoscopy soon just to get an exact clear diagnosis for those hesitant about get a colonoscopy because of what you ve hear or read about the prep procedure do not procrastinate it is not bad at all and you ll sleep during the entire procedure so you spend the day before on the pot getting clean out no biggie i am fight with my wife about get her check and she have the same fear about the test it is not worth gamble your life away when this type of cancer is easily cure if catch early go get it do postscript i have also order the fecul occult blood texte kit so that i can get it check a well you can order on line and do it yourself at home there are supposedly good accurate testing kit out on the market for you to screen yourself annually,negative,negative

ot for some but not for other new blood test detect cancer early british scientist have devise a test that can spot cancer before a tumour develop write lesley dobson catch cancer early is one of the most important step to treat it successfully now a new blood test have been develop that scientist believe could help to detect cancer up to five year early than is possible with exist test the test know a earlycdt for early cancer detection test is base on the work of professor john robertson he is a renowned breast cancer specialist and professor of surgery at the university of nottinghams faculty of medicine and heath science professor richardson start his research in this area use blood sample from people with breast cancer and from a group of high risk woman who give blood sample with their annual mammogram his test were able to identify the signal for the presence of breast cancer in the blood of a percentage of woman who develop the disease the test were also able to detect the signal in some of the high risk patient before they develop breast cancer new technology develop by oncimmune limit a spin off company from nottingham university have refine the testing process the company believe that this mean early detection of cancer and a change to the way many cancer include lung breast ovarian colon and prostate are diagnose and treat the first test for lung cancer early cdt lung tm is being launch this month in the usa and will be launch in the uk early in 2011 geoffrey hamilton fairley executive chairman of oncimmune say we believe this test along with the other we will launch in the next few year will lead to a well prognosis for a significant number of cancer sufferer a simple effective blood test that can detect cancer before it take hold sound like all our christmas come at once but perhaps we should not get the bauble out just yet nell barrie science information officer at cancer research uk say diagnose cancer early will save life so research into way to detect the disease is vital this approach could be helpful but we need to see the result of large trial before we know for sure how effective these test are at detect cancer in the general population professor stephen spiro deputy chairman of the british lung foundation agree that more work is need before we celebrate the test put people who screen positive into the arena that they may be susceptible to a lung cancer or are develop a lung cancer that is still too small to be see explain professor spiro it a series of test look for a panel of six or seven antibody in the blood each antibody is not a very strong predictor of anything but if people have several of these antibodie the concept is that they may be brew or be susceptible to a lung cancer when they ve look at people know to have lung cancer these auto antibody are find in a high percentage of people there are a lot of people with lung cancer who do not have these antibodie the bottom line will be when they take people who are at high risk of lung cancer say heavy smoker or people who smoke and have copd how many of they will have these auto antibody and if they do have these auto antibody do they eventually turn out to have a lung cancer that study still have to be do having say that it is definitely a step forward because the mean that we have now of detect lung cancer early are pretty hopeless we can not detect it early if you can pick up sign that someone might be susceptible to it in a blood test the challenge then is what to do with those people how carefully should we watch they and how often should they have x ray and thing like that i still think it probable this type of test may well be the way that the field will move to pick up a lung cancer before it become visible on an x ray it go to be a lot of worry if you get a positive blood test any individual will want to know how certain the doctor is that they will or will not develop a tumour and that we do not know stay cancer free is our good option but early detection have get to be second good,neutral,neutral

i am new here but here is my story the nodule is visible on pet scan large than previously think now 8 mm x 9 mm and apparently do lite up with moderate uptake they say if biopsy is defer than cat scan should be do at regular interval to monitor the stability of this nodule although the spot where it locate is atypical for malignancy they can not exclude it i also have picture and it quite apparent this wa a preliminary report so i sleep on it i think that the rational for do the pet scan wa to see if there were any cancer cell those that suck up the glucose uptake so i wonder is it ever possible that something can uptake and not be cancer i can not seem to find that info anywhere if anyone is go to do any biopie or whatever i want someone who know what the hell they are do of course hopkin just creep i out a they nearly kill i with the pe this wa something i wa not expect cause the pain in my chest subside and the pulmonologist say it would definately come back negative we never discus what would happen if it do not the pulmonologist want to refer to a thoracic surgeon i freak out she say they will have to go in and remove it can not be biopsie and if it cancer they will take the entire lobe i could not breathe this wa over my cell phone i hang up and leave work cry i am go to i think get a second opinion from a pulmonologist oncologist type doctor probably at hopkin when i manage to eek that out she agree i should go wherever i feel most comfortable because no one wa go to tell i it wa not cancer might not be but either way accord to she it must come out i wa think that when i have suspect ovca i have a gyn oncologist do that exploratory surgery that net i a pe last year no cancer either so it probably never need to be do i am all for avoid uneccessary surgery i do not think i would survive another major surgery and the pulmonogist suggest i get breathing test do or lung function test or something like that i am stress do anyone have a similiar story with a happy ending i am a non smoker who is married for 20 year to a smoker go figure,negative,negative

10 he say 9 5 10 he then say she need immeadiate surgery and that it spread to the liver he say she will need chemo rad and it will basically prolong the inevitable the next person to see we wa her oncologist who basically say the same thing then we meet the surgeon this guy could have been possese by a demon or in fact be the devil himself he look at my mom in the cold way show no interest in care for she and if she try to say anything he would cut she off he even complain while sit on her bed say how lousy his day wa at one point he tell she that her colon could fall apart in his hand and he would have to put a bag there at this point i know this wa not the doctor for my mom my entire family agree on this we request a new doctor and a new hospital i personally speak with the person in charge and they agree if you are not comfortable with the doc you should find another one she say she would be in the room around 9 am to set up arangment i stay with my mom every min i just do not trust anyone in this hospital and at around 6 am i awake to my mom gasrologist talk to my mom say he know she want another hospital and doctor but he do not see it happen wth my mom then tell he she

i wa read and come across this gem i am no professional here and i have been compile stuff for hour the question i am ask may not really relate but i feel a strong enough connection between the point that i see it a more possible than impossible and i want to share what i have been read up on a lot of folk have post here that cut back on their meat intake seem to help with control h flare meat glue is an additive find in many form meat pink slime is different though equally disturbing in that the slime is a filler where the meat glue is actually bond the meat together at a chemical level meat glue is not require to be list on packaging meat glue is odorless and tasteless and use in all type of meat production beef chicken pork and so on and even use in high price cut of meat such a fillet mignon it have a large presence in the restaurant industry if you eat meat you have no doubt eaten meat glue once more if you do not eat meat you have probably still eat meat glue a it is the bond agent in many vegitarian or otherwise non meat product again nobody is require to list it therefore how do you actually know what is being use there are two main type of meat glue the first go by the name of fibromex and consist of blood plasma from pig and cow the follow is quote directly from the website of sonac affiliate with vion food group what is in fibromex fibrinogen that is fibrinogen enriched plasma that is blood plasma with additional fibrinogen add thrombin an enzyme which initiate the gelling and the subsequent bind process of meat or fish piece that is the enzyme which bond with the fibrinogen and the fibrinogen in the meat to make it a solid chunk plasmapowder fg is only consist a high concentration of fibrinogen there is no thrombin present in this product however the bind process of meat piece is induce by natural present thrombin also activia the yogurt have nothing to do with it completely coincidental which is a powdered form of the coagulant like enzyme transglutaminase i believe it is produce by ajinomoto but have not go too deep into research that a of write this it is already crazy long let i be clear these are both make of the same substance derrive from animal and is already present in our body there are a couple of thing that pique my interest a i wa read about this i could not help draw comparison first the idea that there is something in our fat that may be cause our h outbreak second is the case for tissue transglutaminase it is relate to gluten sensitivity also the interesting thing about tissue transglutaminase is that it have stem cell like property what this mean is it can both renew itself and it can become any type of cell live bacteria can pick up code information from dead bacteria is it possible that stem cell may pick up code information from our tissue or dead foreign transglutaminase and produce the defective or thickening of tissue most of the mri scan i have see note that there is a thickening of skin flesh in h patient third our body are believe to have a set amount of fibrinogen a produce by our liver if fibrinogen is over abundant in our body it cause likewise an over abundance of fibrin production lead to thing like blood clot stroke heart attack and cancer but what if the amount of our fibrinogen is only synthesize by our liver in response to the amount of fibrinogen we get from our diet fourth the tnfa tumor necrose factor alpha number in h patient are extremely high tnfa play a role in the immune system and present with inflammation one of the role it play is to break down tough tissue fibrin is a tough tissue that resist breakdown through proteolysis breakdown by enzyme fifth and this is slightly leave field brief comparison with another disease dermatitis herpetiformis dh is a skin disease that cause blister that come and go they display similar symptom such a itching redness and burn a well a fluid fill blister it is classify a autoimmune and cause by the autoantigen action of epidermal transglutaminase this respond well to change in diet limiting gluten ok so i realize how far of a stretch this might seem but the transglutaminase in meat glue can bind different type of meat i would like to see the metabolic pathway for this stuff how is it being break down and store how is it eliminate from our body and in what form are we reuse it what is it about the area where sweat gland occur most what would increase the reaction if we are treat h patient with tnfa inhibitor is there an increase risk of cancer because our natural response are no long destroy the abnormal cell or process ok now i am just down to question and a severe lack of sleep interesting all the same hsintolerant,neutral,neutral

a friend on here say i should ask the dr abt alt an ast so i ggogle it an read upon it it say these test are usually wrong an have no meaning is this really true this is what it say frequently ask question about ast alt ggtp ap jeff punch md division of transplantation university of michigan what do these letter mean these letter are acronym for enzyme protein inside of cell ast for example stand for aspartate amino transferase this enzyme use to be call serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase sgot hence the two name alt amino alanine transferase ggtp gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and ap alkaline phosphatase different cell have different enzyme inside they depend on the function of the cell liver cell happen to have lot of ast alt and ggtp inside they when cell die or are sick the enzyme leak out cause the blood level of these enzyme to rise which is a way of determine if the cell in question are sick alt is more specific for liver disease than ast because ast is make in more place e g heart intestine muscle so the ast will rise after a heart attack or bruise kidney ggtp and ap are say to be more specific for biliary disease since they are make in bile duct cell in liver disease cause by excess alcohol ingestion the ast tend to exceed the alt while the reverse is true to for viral hepatitis however this particular generalization is often wrong some point these test have meaning but they generally can not be interpret without clinical information they are probably most useful to track or follow a particular problem but even then they often bounce around greatly these number are not linear an ast that is 300 is not twice a bad a 150 normal is le than 50 we are use to number like temperature and dollar if it is 94 degree f outside it is warm than if it is 80 every time and if one have 94 dollar one have more money than if one have 80 liver enzyme value do not behave this way an ast of 94 and 80 are essentially the same to a liver specialist these number do not always detect all liver disease some very patient with severe advanced liver disease will have normal or nearly normal enzyme level are these number indicative of liver funtion not really unfortunately they are often call liver function test or lft but in actuality they do not measure function per se then how is liver function measure other test include albumin and bilirubin and prothrombin time are more truely measure of function but clinical factor must be consider a well,neutral,neutral

risk factor for develop copd include environmental hazard such a cigarette smoke or work in environment that lung damage is likely to occur age most case of copd are diagnose after the age of 40 a this is a disease that progress slowly and genetic just like some people are able to smoke from the time they are 14 until they are 85 with no real ill effect other people find that after ten year of smoking they are face serious consequence genetic play a huge role in who is affect and who is spare i know this subject have come up time and time again but i feel it is something that should be push and push so i am go to push it one more time test can be run for patient experience copd symptom combine with a health history point to the likelihood for a clear diagnosis copd can often be diagnose before symptom begin with the use of a pulmonary function test a chest x ray an arterial blood gas analysis a sputum examination and a ct scan can usually reveal enough information to determine the condition of the lung complication can result from copd include high blood pressure chronic or frequent respiratory infection heart problem lung cancer and depression patient experience copd should follow the physician outline for treatment a closely a possible to decrease the risk of further illness there is no cure for copd treatment option focus in make the patient more comfortable and dispel any further damage to the lung the most important key factor to survive copd is smoke cessation medication that help open the airway pain medication and medication to help fight off infection are all part of the treatment plan however if the patient continue to smoke there is little chance that the physician will be able to do anything to prolong life or enhance the quality of life jame,neutral,neutral

i am grasp at straw on how to approach a health issue i have been deal with for the past 6 8 month or so this board seem to be a good a forum a any but if there is somewhere online well suit to seek advice with these problem please feel free to direct i there this post could have go under a few different forum on this board alone but when you re talk amylase lipase the pancreas is the main concern i honestly do not know if this is a pancreas problem though this is go to be a lot to read and i thank anyone in advance that take the time to do so and share any feedback i am a male in my early 30 generally in good health i have a stretch of about 10 day early this year where my bowel movement increase from the normal once per day to 3 5 time per day i wa very concerned and my doctor suspect ib but after some blood work she see that my amylase wa in the 500 level and send i to get a cat scan she do not let i know that my lipase wa normal though and after read online about elevated amylase i jump to the conclusion i probably have pancreatitis i do enjoy drink alcohol on a regular basis and this period of irregular bowel movement do come around the time of a particularly bad weekend in term of my alcohol consumption i figure that a decade of drinking have probably do this to my pancrea when i go to the hospital for the cat scan the technician think it wa strange that my script just with the barium milkshake prep and not with an imaging injection she almost try to convince i to go ahead and get the imaging anyway to eliminate the need to come back and do the scan again with it i think this wa outside of the area of expertise of the technician to decide and tell she so she go and consult with the doctor who wa go to review the scan and he confirm that i just need the barium drink milkshake and they have i chug even more to get the good scan possible that stuff is le than pleasant from there i go to a gi specialist where i wa see by a nurse practitioner she wa also consult with a doctor on staff no appointment were available with a doctor in the immediate future at the time by the time of this appointment my bowel movement have return to normal i should note that i have no other unusual symptom during this time period no pain cramp nausea or anything of that nature when i explain this to the nurse practitioner and she review my blood work and the cat scan she basically tell i there wa no reason she could see why my amylase wa so elevated this wa the first time i find out that my lipase level were in fact normal so pancreatitis wa unlikely wish my doctor know this because i have work myself up that i definitely have it for the 2 3 week this wa go on the cat scan result were completely normal or unremarkable a the terminology go after examine my abdoman and review with i the lack of other symptom the nurse practitioner say the other possible culprit such a ulcer liver problem cancer and so on were unlikely she speak with the doctor and come back and let i know the most likely scenario wa either that this wa a one time anomaly or that i have a condition call macroamylasemia which is benign and cause elevated amylase level either way she do not think i have much cause for concern she write a script for i to take a 24 hour urine sample to check for amylase level there and to get more blood work in a month or so she also point out that if i have macroamylasemia my amylase level have probably been elevate for a while and were most likely unrelated to the stretch of irregular bowel movement i have the urine test come back normal but the blood work have my amylase level still in the 400 level at this point i wa tell to go back to the gi specialist but i do not understand why maybe the nurse practitioner do not explain this well but from what she tell i there wa not much more they could do for i in this situation i do not believe there is a way to test for macroamylasemia although a i say i may be mistaken a my symptom have subside and i wa at a point in my health insurance where i would be pay 100 out of pocket up until october i make the decision not to go back to the gi specialist my logic being we were probably go to need to start a whole new batch of test and in the end i wa skeptical that they would provide any new information i tell myself if my symptom return i would address it then now i have notice a i have get old that the day after drink i tend to have much high frequency of bowel movement and since thanksgiving i have have another stretch of time where my bowel movement have noticeably increase for the first time consistently since the first episode 6 8 month back while i do think the most likely scenario is that i have macroamylasemia i also do not doubt that the drinking i have do have take it toll on my body and my bowel issue could be relate this period since thanksgiving have not been a constant problem every day and have not been a bad a the previous stretch so i am not a concerned about it but i do coincidentally have an appointment with my doctor come up later this week just for a check up i am not sure how to approach these problem with her past another cat scan with imaging i do not know what else can be do to determine what s go on with i and for the problem i am have i am not certain what the imaging will show that the previous scan do not show maybe a more detailed look at my liver with my insurance i am back at a point where i can easily afford some expensive work but i do not want to do it just for the sake of have it do and then hit that donut hole in my coverage again once again i am very thankful for anyone who take the time to read all of that and give i any feedback half of i feel like i am make too big deal out of this and that i am probably just a normal male around this age who have indulge in a bachelor lifestyle and whose body can not handle the abuse i have put it through the same way i could in my 20 but the other half of i is concern i am ignore what could be a potentially very serious problem,neutral,negative

copd is associate with several comorbiditie traditionally comorbidity is define a a disease coexist with the primary disease of interest in copd this definition is slightly problematic since certain coexist illness may be a consequence or may present a causal association with copd the most common comorbiditie describe in association with copd are hypertension diabetes heart failure ischaemic heart disease cancer osteoporosis depression and anemia copd comorbiditie should be consider when estimate the social and economic burden of the disease these comorbid disease clearly affect health outcome in copd in fact copd patient are think to mainly die of non respiratory disorder such a cancer or cardiovascular disease although it is difficult to determine the underlying cause of death among patient with multiple disease especially when a common risk factor such a tobacco use is involve in arecent study it wa show that in copd patient treat with long term oxygen therapy comorbiditie were one of the predictor of all cause and respiratory mortality moreover comorbiditie are associate with a high risk of hospitalization and are one of the strong predictor of increase cost in copd clinical practice guideline seem to ignore the fact that most patient with copd quite often have additional comorbiditie the increase recognition of the role of comorbiditie in copd have make all cause mortality a paramount end point for the evaluation of novel therapy the two recently publish large copd trial torch towards a revolution in copd health and uplift understand the potential long term impact on function with tiotropium are example of how copd study have change because of comorbiditie a recent evaluation of the usa national hospital discharge survey analyze more than 47 million hospital discharge for copd that occur in the usa from 1979 to 2001 in adult great than 25 year of age the prevalence and in hospital mortality were great in hospital discharge with copd mention a a primary or secondary diagnosis versus those that do not mention copd specifically a high rate of in hospital mortality for pneumonia hypertension heart failure and thoracic malignancy wa associate with a hospital diagnosis of copd copd is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease strong epidemiological evidence point to reduce fev1 a a marker for cardiovascular mortality in a longitudinal population base study include patient from the nhane i it wa show that patient with poor lung function have the high risk of cardiovascular mortality10 this association of decrease lung function and increase cardiovascular mortality is far support by other study such a the copenhagen city heartstudy the underlie mechanism link copd to atherosclerosis ischemic heart disease and stroke are not fully elucidated persistent systemic low grade inflammation is believe to be one of the central event lead to plaque formation under normal condition the human endothelium do not support leukocyte adhesion which is the building block of plaque genesis however in an inflammatory state such a copd the endothelium overexpresse surface adhesion molecule that allow circulate white blood cell to adhere to damage endothelial surface and accordingly trigger inflammatory reaction exaggerated subclinical atherosclerosis have been find in smoker with airflow obstruction compare to control smoker and control non smoker without airflow obstruction impair vascular reactivity is an important factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and endothelial function seem to be significantly impair in patient with stable copd it have been show that arterial wall stiffness which relate to cardiovascular risk is increase in patient with copd compare to smoking control subject and healthy subject these finding suggest that copd may result in endothelial dysfunction which may be a mechanism for the enhanced cardiovascular risk in copd moreover in another study systemic arterial wall stiffness wa associate with emphysema a ass by ct scan moreover in a recent study in a greek cohort of copd patient without cardiovascular comorbiditie the presence of emphysema in highresolution ct scan wa relate to increase systemic oxidative stress and fibrinogen these finding indicate that mechanism involve in airway wall destruction and emphysema may also produce increase cardiovascular risk in patient with copd mortality due to copd continue to rise whereas mortality relate to cardiovascular disease appear to decline this is partly due to the widespread use of preventive therapy that have been show to reduce cardiovascular mortality accordingly a question arise whether appropriate use of such therapy could have a similar impact on copd mortality statin therapy may provide a new therapeutic option in copd statin which are mainly use a lipid lower agent for treatment of metabolic syndrome have been show to exert both local lung and systemic anti inflammatory and antioxidant effect statin treatment wa associate with a slow rate of decline in fev1 in elderly subject this wa support by further retrospective study use large database that have show an effect of statin on mortality of copd patient randomize control clinical trial are clearly warrant to ass whether these finding can be confirm prospectively thus provide a new treatment for these patient similarly drug use to treat respiratory disease could have beneficial effect in cardiovascular disease an intriguing finding raise from a post hoc analysis of the european respiratory society study on copd euroscop wa that long term inhale corticosteroid ic although not effective in reduce the long term rate of decline in fev1 they lower the incidence of ischemic cardiac event in patient with mild copd this finding wa far support by other retrospective database study clearly show that ic may reduce systemic inflammation in patient with copd there is a clear link between copd and lung cancer independently of active smoking there is grow evidence that chronic inflammation may play a salient role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer at the molecular level activation of nuclear factor nf kb transcription factor may have major relevance for both cancer and copd there are study suggest that nf kb activation in the airway of copd patient cause chronic inflammation and increase the risk of lung tumour development an analysis of 22 year follow up datum from 5402 participant from the first national health and nutrition examination survey nhane i include a total of 113 case of lung cancer reveal an inverse correlation between lung cancer risk and the degree of airflow obstruction copd is also associate with osteoporosis in up to 70 of patient and is relate to several underlying mechanism include malnutrition sedentary life smoke steroid treatment and systemic inflammation the prevalence of osteoporosis is increase in more severe disease and both osteoporosis and osteopenia are invariably present in patient with low body mass index and fat free mass moreover copd have been recently recognize a an independent risk factor for the identification of osteoporosis in man anemia have been show to be an independent risk factor for reduce functional capacity and increase mortality in copd in a retrospective analysis of hemoglobin level in a cohort of 683 copd patient anemia wa present in 70 of patient and polycythemia in 6 depression represent another frequent comorbidity in copd patient especially due to the fact that they often face major physical impairment and chronic dyspnea patient with severe disease are in even great risk of develop depression the treatment of depression in copd patient is important a it far diminish the functional performance of individual patient and is associate with impaired quality of life massive evidence suggest that clinical feature of copd and airflow limitation are poorly correlate so that a more comprehensive approach is need it is clear that prognostic tool that well capture comorbiditie demonstrate superior performance that do fev1 alone the bode index body mass index airflow obstruction dyspnoea and exercise capacity is a multidimensional instrument that wa find to predict prognosis of copd patient well than fev1 in fact the bode index wa more effective in predict copd all cause and respiratory mortality than fev1 alone this indicate that it is important to evaluate globally each individual patient when ass copd prognosis beyond the goldstandard fev1 measurement this global assessment definitely include comorbiditie since they may well interfere in the vicious circle of dyspnea and impaired exercise capacity of copd patient the causal relationship of copd and several comorbiditie is not clear do comorbiditie make patient more susceptible to the consequence of copd do copd increase their susceptibility to these comorbiditie or is it a combination of both definitely more work is need to establish the potential mechanism and causal pathway that link comorbiditie and copd,neutral,neutral

hi everyone i am fairly new to the board but just need to vent today i wa diagnose with bowel cancer in 2003 and have chemo radiotherapy and then surgery ileostomy then follow up chemo eventually the cancer spread to the liver which i have remove last july but unfortunately my surgeon wa unable to get it all a it wa in the lymph gland and node anyway i have been in horrific chronic pain lately and i have some exploratory surgery do two week ago a biopsy wa take and come back positive for cancer back in the rectum i have not really been happy with the treatment i have been receive from my oncologist or surgeon and so i start a search to find the good of the good which to cut a long story short i find and go to see today he find that i have cancer around the anus and far up and at the site of the first operation in order to remove it he would have to remove my rectum vagina bladder uterus and i would be leave with 3 bag rather than the one i already have he also say that he would not want to do the surgery a it is difficult very big surgery and at least 6 month recovery plus i would lose quality of life and the main reason is that the cancer have spread and there is no cure for it now they can only hope to palliate i to buy i a little time in le pain i am so sad i am only just turn 39 and i have a little 6 year old boy who adore i and i he we really have the most special bond you could have a mother and son i do not have long to go perhaps 12 18 month at a guess and i can not bear the thought of leave he i am separate from his dad and my little boy do not see his dad all that much they do have a relationship but it could be a whole lot well he will not feel secure have to go and live with his dad who by the way have make it clear will not move down here so jack could stay at his own school with his own friend and family but he will move he up where he live 1 1 2 hour away regardless of what is good for jack so not only do jack lose his mum he also lose his home his school his friend and neighbour and family member from down this way the one thing that stand out in my mind apart from everything this brilliant surgeon say to i wa that he believe naturopathy is well worth a go a he believe it will prolong my life somewhat so i am of course go to give this everything i have get to give and also do positive thinking and every other alternative thing i can possibly do so who know maybe i will at least last a few more year than what they predict i hope so a i really can not bear to leave my son please pray for i and send positive vibe to the universe a i can use all the help and support i can get also feel free to speak with i a i love get to know people and also help other if i can thank for let i waffle on so long here and get this off my chest,positive,positive

most know that copaxone rebif avonex and betaseron plus other medication require periodic liver enzyme test i do not think many people think much about this so i am make this post later in this post i am go to cover some of the many thing your liver do for you it is important that if you are stress your liver with extra burden of thing like these medication that you try to be easy on your liver in other way since a healthy liver let we live well hepat itis mean liver inflammation many thing can trigger this but to understand more about the cause you need to understand what your liver do the liver do the follow thing 1 recycle the hemoglobin off your red blood cell rbc which die every 120 day but you make like 5 million rbc per minute so this is a huge job in itself 2 filter toxin out of the blood 3 process vitamin that is d your skin make into 25 hydroxy vitamin d3 once kidney process it far it is a message to gut to absorb calcium 4 process most medication you take 5 process hormone that is sex hormone 6 make bile to help emulsify fat so you can absorb it use for skin brain cell some hormone 7 work in conjunction with the pancrea to break down sugar and store it 8 make enzyme chain of amino acid aka protein and so on and so on so the liver can easily get over work and damage do to it effect it ability to do the above and more task virus can attack the liver to cause inflammation most people think of this when they hear hepatitis however alcohol drug and autoimmune problem can cause issue with inflammation too i would think certain bacteria could damage it but i digress i do not know all the medication that could cause problem obviously the crab miss drug can here is a list of other med i look up http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmedhealth pmh0001273,neutral,neutral

will beat this cancer in her body because we are all togetherfighte january 12 2016 so the decision have been make tonight that on thursday meredith anno will be cut her hair off now there are a couple of option here i can do a cut her hair then shave it off myself b take she somewhere that will not overcharge i to shave she bald i have no problem do the job myself i am just scared that since cut hair is not my profession i may hurt she more than help she her decision to shave it off is so that the chemo will not tell she when it will take it away she is show she still have a say and control in what happen i personally think this is a great statement to make a it show she is still fight so i am open to suggestion a to who to use on thursday or if it is well do by i i am all ear

i am sure all of we remember a point in time when we a kid think nothing could hurt bad than a stubbed toe since then a we have get more and more damage our definition of the bad pain ever have change and change again this is why i think the doctor ask i what my pain level is on a scale of 1 to 10 is so useless what someone else find a 9 like get a tattoo i might not even notice what i consider a good day at a 4 might be someone else 10 or even bad their 4 might by my 10 when i wa work a a nurse a zillion year ago a teenage kid come into the office in a wheelchair two week early he wa the captain of the basketball team the doctor demand he be on the table to be check out so a carefully a i could i pick he up and put he on the table and he scream for five minute this wa repeat when i put he back in the wheelchair that always strike i a what a 10 look like the good news is that the doctor i work for find the correct diagnosis of leukemia and within a month he wa out play basketball again but i will never forget that 15 year old kid so where wa i go with all of this level of pain we can all understand an immediate ouch of hit our hand against something most of we are hip on the dull ache of old injury or arthritis of of arthritis bring about by old injury that pain that is always there but that we can still say that this spot hurt and this area ache and this spot hurt most of all but after that come where the pain area start to blend together instead of my know hurt my whole leg hurt or i do not know where the pain is originate but this whole area of my body is kill i then there is what i call a fine line and hubby call a shelf where the amount of pain exceed the brain ability to process it anymore at which point everything hurt more of le equally high brain function are overwrite a the brain use all synapsis to try to process pain everything below that point can usually be treat more effectively with pain med or otc method massage aleve ten unit and so on once the brain can do nothing but rattle around with the pain impulse it is hard to get back under the line that shelf to where something can be do to fix it i have find that there is actually one more level in pain it is one i try to avoid at all cost it is where the brain just stop accept pain input a blockade go up and pain sense are not feel anymore a numbness fill the place i know should be scream i can feel nothing but i get cognitive function back but i pay for any activity i do while numb when i go back to pain,positive,positive

hi guy i would like to thank everyone for their post a it is help i a good deal figure out my dad situation i wa wonder what anyone else experience with gene mutation is let i start from the beginning we were under the impression a week or so ago that dad do not have a whole lot of time leave at 58 a a non smoker he wa diagnose with stage 3c assume 4 adenocarcinoma of the lung it is spread to his local lymph node and also into his trachea assume that it is spread to his adrenal gland because there wa suspicious activity there during the pet scan nearly 6x suv but the nodule is very small and my dad is not so they say it a very difficult biopsy to do to find out it is go to a very popular place for lung cancer to go they would also treat stage 4 like they would stage 3c anyway so that is how we get to the assume stage 4 part his oncologist do his fellowship at this place where they test for gene mutation sound like they are really back log but he send my dad tissue to they not sure if standard practice or not start the first round of chemo i believe the platinum base one but i have learn and forget so much over the last two month please forgive i on any error we are deffinitely in info overload at the moment anyway get in a light dose champ through it work a week of half day immediately after chemo when the doc say it would take he down for at least a week or two anyway stress depression anger any and every emotion we seem to have feel the extreme of over the last couple month so right now i do not want to get my hope up on the info that we receive yesterday i do not know if i can go through that again in a week or month or 3 month or whatever come to find out it a gene mutation efgr exon 19 now what google say and what the oncologist say are a little different the article i google give i the impression that the progression will be block for an average of 20 month now i wa not in the room with the oncologist so all i have is my mother repeat of the information but he wa make it sound like significantly long and there wa a chance the medication might even shrink the masse and potentially extend his life indeffinitely i really do not want to get my hope up i am extatic at a free extension of 20 month it feel like a miracle and that i should not ask for more otherwise i might lose the first miracle but is anyone here familiar with mutation first hand i really do not want to get my hope up and stay realistic prepare for bad case scenario and hope for good is how i have manage to keep my head together for the last two month what can i expect,neutral,negative
hello all i finally have the colonoscopy schedule i call my gi doctor and speak with his nurse on friday and tell she these symptom and the way i feel are afeecte my life and that i need answer they were wait to schedule it until after the result of the stool sample come back i just drop those at the lab today so they will not be back for a few day i am an emotional mess along with being in physical pain and just could not stand wait any long she speak with the doc yesterday and he tell she to fit i in next tuesday i wa thrilled until i speak with my husband i have completely forget that he is out of town all next week i refuse to have the test without he being here so it is now reschedule for oct 30 i know it is not that far away but i feel like it is year and year away i ask about the pill for prep but his nurse say he will not have his patient use those and believe the liquid do a well job i can not recall which liquid he use anyway my question is regard the colonoscopy i am not at all nervous about the test itself but i am terrifed panic stricken about the result and i hate anesthesia i will get through it though i have too during the colonoscopy i know they will remove any polyp they find i guess i am a bit confused on whether the doc can tell if it is a tumor cancer or just a polyp obviously it is all base on the pathology report but when he is do the procedure how do he know the difference and how will he be able to tell whether he should remove it or schedule surgery for a later date will he tell i upon wake whether he feel it is cancer i am miserable i have totally convince myself that this is rectal cancer with all my symptom it really can not be anything else i am even have pressure and fullness sensation that have been increase for the last 2 week thank again for all your support trish,negative,negative

i when into the web site and look up my illness and though it talk about have cancer i do not have cancer but i still get the symptome that go along with it but because there is still a gland leave that they can not find because it is a small a the end of a safty pin and they can not find it but they teast i yearly for cancer because they are scared that some doy it could turn into cancer a lond a that parathyroid gland is leave in side of i i am send you the information that i find so if you want to read it you will beable to understand what i am try to fight through and pray thay i have the streangh to get through this sorry that it is so long but there is just so much information on how this illness is affect my health hypercalcemiaoverview an increase level of calcium in the bloodstream is most often a complication of cancer and is refer to a hypercalcemia of malignancy in it severe form hypercalcemia may be a life threaten emergency management of hypercalcemia may involve increase fluid intake a well a the use of diuretic and bisphosphonate drug what is hypercalcemia what cause hypercalcemia what are the sign and symptom of hypercalcemia how is hypercalcemia diagnose how is hypercalcemia treat what is hypercalcemia hypercalcemia is an increase level of calcium in the bloodstream this disorder is most commonly cause by malignancy call hypercalcemia of malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism other cause of elevated calcium are le common and are usually not consider until it have been determine that neither malignancy nor parathyroid disease is present hypercalcemia of malignancy occur in approximately 10 of patient with advanced cancer the occurrence of hypercalcemia may rise a high a 40 in some type of cancer include breast lung and multiple myeloma what cause hypercalcemia hypercalcemia of malignancy have many cause it may be relate to the spread of cancer from it site of origin to bone in the body a process call metastasis cancer cell can spread or metastasize through the blood and lymph system a cancer cell may break away from the original location in the body and travel in the circulatory system until it get lodge in a small capillary network in bone tissue cancer may also spread to bone from the adjacent cancer though this occur le frequently than spread by the blood stream bone metastasis result in injury to the bone tissue although bone appear to be the most static of all the tissue in the body it is actually very dynamic and active normal bone is constantly being remodel or break down and rebuild every week human recycle 5 to 7 of their bone mass a much a half a gram of calcium may enter or leave the adult skeleton each day one important function of bone remodeling is maintenance of blood calcium level calcium is necessary for many process in the body include contraction of muscle nerve function blood clotting and cell division only 1 of the calcium in the body is available in circulation for these function the other 99 is lock in the bone if blood calcium level drop calcium must be release from the bone through remodel in order to maintain important physiological function that require calcium in the case of hypercalcemia bone metastasis cause an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption result in the release of excess calcium into the blood what are the sign and symptom of hypercalcemia sign and symptom of hypercalcemia may include nausea fatigue vomit lethargy stomach pain moodiness constipation irritability anorexia confusion excessive thirst extreme muscle weakness dry mouth or throat irregular heart beat frequent urination coma these many sign and symptom are commonly attribute to either the cancer treatment or the malignancy itself and may make it difficult for doctor to detect hypercalcemia of malignancy when it first occur this disorder can be severe and difficult to manage severe hypercalcemia is a medical emergency require immediate treatment how is hypercalcemia diagnose hypercalcemia may be diagnose with a blood test blood calcium level are test by take a small amount of blood from the patient with a needle the blood is collect in tube and send to a lab for evaluation normal blood calcium range from 8 5 to 10 5 milligram per decliliter mg dl of blood the normal range may vary slightly from lab to lab more than one test may be necessary to determine that blood calcium level are abnormally high in a person with cancer a high blood calcium level is consider a medical emergency and treatment should be start immediately how is hypercalcemia treat the good treatment for hypercalcemia due to cancer is treatment of the cancer itself however since hypercalcemia often occur in patient whose cancer is advanced or have not respond to treatment management of hypercalcemia is sometimes necessary treatment for hypercalcemia is base on a number of factor include the condition of the patient and the severity of the hypercalcemia increase fluid intake and the use of diuretic have been standard practice most recently bisphosphonate drug have become an effective approach hydration one of the primary treatment for hypercalcemia of malignancy is hydration which may consist of increase oral fluid intake or intravenous through a vein administration of fluid hydration help decrease the calcium level through dilution and cause the body to eliminate excess calcium through the urine for mild to moderate elevation of calcium patient are usually direct to increase oral fluid intake for acute hypercalcemia hydration with saline is immediately administer intravenously the rate of hydration is base upon the severity of the hypercalcemia the severity of dehydration and the ability of the patient to tolerate rehydration diuretic sometimes hypercalcemia of malignancy is treat with a diuretic the most commonly use diuretic furosemide lasixa a cause the kidney to produce more urine a a result the amount of free water in the body is reduce along with an increase in urine volume furosemide cause loss of calcium sodium and potassium furosemide is well tolerate however it is not free of side effect which may include dehydration low blood potassium and low blood sodium furosemide is available by intravenous administration a well a oral tablet intravenous method of administration is use to achieve an urgent effect oral tablet are use for maintenance oral tablet of furosemide are administer once or twice a day bisphosphonate drug recently bisphosphonate have become effective treatment for prevent the complication of bone metastasis include fracture relieve bone pain and hypercalcemia the goal of treatment for bone metastasis is palliative to relieve pain and risk of fracture and have historically consist of surgery radiation therapy and pain medication bisphosphonate drug a new approach to treatment for bone metastasis can effectively prevent loss of bone that occur from metastatic lesion reduce the risk of fracture and decrease pain bisphosphonate drug inhibit bone resorption or break down bone is constantly being a remodeleda by two type of cell osteoclast which break down bone and osteoblast which rebuild bone although the exact process by which bisphosphonate work is not completely understand it is think that bisphosphonate inhibit osteoclast and induce apoptosis cell death in these cell there is also evidence that these drug bind to bone thereby block osteoclastic resorption cancer cell release various factor that stimulate osteoclastic activity cause increased breakdown of bone by inhibit osteoclast bisphosphonate drug effectively reduce the detrimental impact that cancer cell have on bone density clinical trial have demonstrate the activity of two new bisphosphonate drug in cancer patient zoledronic acid zometaa a and pamidronate arediaa a bisphosphonate effectively prevent or delay bone destruction and related pain this activity have been demonstrate in clinical trial with multiple myeloma 1 and breast cancer 2 patient when compare treatment with chemotherapy plus pamidronate to chemotherapy alone patient receive pamidronate were le likely to experience complication relate to cancerous involvement of the bone such a fracture additionally patient receive pamidronate live long have a le need for radiation and surgical treatment and experience significantly le pain than those patient not receive the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid demonstrate the strong activity of these two bisphosphonate drug in a recent clinical trial zoledronic acid wa show to be a safe and effective treatment in prostate cancer patient with bone metastasis compare to placebo zoledronic acid significantly reduce the proportion of patient who experience skeletal complication extend the time to first skeletal complication and significantly reduce the risk of skeletal complication over the course of this 15 month study 3 these result are notable because they show activity of zoledronic acid in blastic lesion in which extra bone have build up whereas previous trial have only show activity of bisphosphonate on metastasis in which the bone is weaken both zoledronic acid and pamidronate are administer intravenously but zoledronic acid provide a more convenient regiman for patient zoledronic acid is administer in a dose ten time low than pamidronate result in an infusion time that is significantly short 15 minute versus 2 4 hour for pamidronate in an effort to eliminate the need for intravenous administration research is aim at develop more effective oral

diagnosis and treatment drug name table supportive care introduction back to the table of content hypercalcemia high level of calcium in your blood is the most common life threaten disorder that is associate with cancer it occur in 10 to 20 of cancer patient lung cancer breast cancer and multiple myeloma are the most prevalent malignancy associate with hypercalcemia the cause of hypercalcemia is when cancer spread to or invade the bone and when malignant cell release certain factor that cause calcium to be release from the bone this cause bone to break down fast than they are being rebuild result in an increase calcium release into the blood stream normally your kidney would eliminate excess calcium from your blood but with hypercalcemia the kidney can not keep up with the elimination process some physical sign to look out for when your blood calcium is too high would be tiredness confusion unstable gait constipation decrease appetite increase urination and bone pain if hypercalcemia is not diagnose it can lead to more serious complication like heart problem convulsion and even coma if you feel any of these symptom or if your family member or friend are notice that you are not walk steady or seem confused you should make an appointment with your doctor immediately your doctor can check your blood to see if you are suffer from hypercalcemia diagnosis and treatment back to the table of content mild hypercalcemia correct total serum calcium 12 mg dl patient usually do not have any symptom of hyercalcemia when the blood calcium level are this low the good option here is to stay well hydrated exercise and your doctor should follow your blood calcium level while you are undergo treatment for your cancer moderate to severe hypercalcemia correct total serum calcium 12 mg dl your doctor may prescribe some drug biphosphonate to stabilize the bone and prevent hypercalcemia pamidronate arediaa a and zolendronic acid zometaa a are the preferred drug for treat hypercalcemia and maintain blood calcium level these drug do not decrease calcium rapidly so other measure may be need to reduce calcium more quickly this may mean that you may have to be admit to a hospital for monitoring and drug therapy this therapy include a lot of intravenous fluid usually a saline solution along with a diuretic like furosemide lasixa a the diuretic should not be start however until you have been properly hydrate with the saline solution pamidronate or zolendronic acid may be use concurrently and then every month if need sometimes a drug call calcitonin is use to help low calcium until the biphosphonate start work around 2 to 4 day these drug are not available in oral form so they must be give intravenously other medication that are use to treat hypercalcemia are etidronate clodronate plicamycin and gallium nitrate however they are not a effective they have more side effect and they are not tolerate very well below is a table of the most effective and well

tobacco chewer he wa none of those jim doctor do not know why he would get this kind of cancer they have no answer for we say his wife dixie he get so sick so fast we really think it have to be something he wa expose to over there so many of the soldier we meet with cancer at walter reed army medical center complain about the polluted air they live in the brown water they have to use the dust they breathe from exploded munition it wa very toxic a a mining engineer lauderdale know exactly what it mean when he see the thick black smoke pour nonstop out of the smokestack that line the iraq kuwait border area where he wa station for three month in 2005 he write to i that everyone wa complain about their stinging eye and sore throat and headache dixie say for jim to say something like that to complain wa very unusual one of the mother on the cancer ward have picture of her son bathe in the brown water she say he die of kidney cancer station in roughly the same area a lauderdale yet another soldier now fight terminal colon cancer describe the scene there of oil refinerie a cement factory a chlorine factory and a sulfuric acid factory all spew unfiltered and uncontrolled substance into the air one day we were walk toward the port and they have sulfuric acid explode out of the stack we were cover with it everything wa burn on we and we have to turn around and get to the medic say army staff sgt frank valentin 35 not long after he develop intense rectal pain which doctor tell he for month wa hemorrhoid finally diagnose with aggressive colorectal cancer require extensive surgery result in a colostomy bag he wa give few than two year to live by his walter reed physician he is now a couple of month past that death sentence but his chemo drug are start to fail and the cancer is eat into his liver and lung he spend his day with his wife and three child at their florida home i do not know how much time i have he say suspect deplete uranium none of these soldier know for sure what s kill they but they suspect it is a cascade of multiple toxic exposure couple with the intense stress of daily life in a war zone weaken their immune system there is so much pollution from so many source your body can not fight what s come at it valentin say and you do not eat well or sleep well ever that weaken you too there is no chance to gather your strength these are kid 19 20 and 21 get all kind of cancer the walter reed cancer ward is pack full with they the prime suspect in all this in the mind of many victim and some scientist is what s know a

carry desert sand and dust for mile say dixie lauderdale who suspect her husband wa expose to at least some deplete uranium many vet from the gulf war blame the chemical use in that conflict for their gulf war syndrome illnesse congress order study a the controversy rage congress have order a comprehensive independent study due in october of the health effect of deplete uranium exposure on you s soldier and their child and a du bill order all member of the you s military expose to it be identify and test is work it way through congress basically we want to get ahead of this curve and not go through the year of painful denial we go through with agent orange that wa the legacy of vietnam say rep ral grijalva d ariz a co sponsor of the bill we want an independent agency to do independent testing of our soldier and find out what s really go on theseincident of cancer and illness that all of we are hear about back in our district are not just anecdotal there is a pattern here and yes i do suspect du may be at the bottom of it what s happen today grow number of sickened soldier who say they were expose to it amid firm denial of harm from military brass almost mirror the early stage of the agent orange aftermath it take the you s military almost two decade to admit the powerful chemical defoliant kill and disable you s troop in the jungle of vietnam and to begin compensate they for it doctor flabbergast whatever it wa that strike jim lauderdale do a terrifying job of it send to walter reed with oral cancer in april 2005 he undergo his first extensive and disfigure surgery remove half his tongue to get to tumor in the mouth and throat a second surgery follow a month later to clear out more of those area five month later another surgery remove a new neck tumor then come heavy chemotherapy and radiation shortly after he have a massive heart attack undergo another surgery to place stent in his artery two week later the cancer wa back and growing rapidly force a fourth surgery in january 2006 by this time much of his neck and shoulder tissue wa go and doctor try to reconstruct a tongue use tissue from his wrist he could not swallow so wa feed through a tube into his

i start post a month ago with my update after not being on here for a few year brief history 5 year ago i wa tell after a liver biopsy that i have a year or le to live and no transplant for i because i drink and transplant wa all that could help i i wa not put on any med and i never hear from that doctor again i quit drinking and spend year on my own healing which i have mention in past post about a month ago i see another liver specialist who want lot of testing and want to put i on transplant list for his fear of my develop cancer due to the cirrhosis he wa not optimistic and rattle off statistic instead of look at i a an individual all i want wa an ultrasound to see my progress because i know my body wa heal i do not see he again and look for another doctor i find one two week ago and he is awesome he listen to i and he actually try to be optimistic even though he have see a lot in his profession i wish that more people know the power of doctor suggestion people hear they need a transplant or they hear all the stat and so their subconscious make it so those thought sabotage their body natural instinct to heal i like to think of myself in a speed car head straight to my destination of a healthy liver when doctor say transplant or cancer or whatever it may be that is the opposite of perfect liver health those word whiz pas the driver side window out of the corner of my eye and were behind i in the distance far behind and forget about because i wa stay on my road to liver health i mention to the doctor that my liver is my savior and my friend i tell he how whenever i stress about something my liver cramp or swell a little or knock at my abdomen it let i know to breathe and calm my stress because stress can not help you heal when i take notice and calm the stress my liver soften and breathe a well i can feel it he say he find that interesting because he is never think of a correlation between the brain and the liver i tell he that it is true because that is the way it is he then admit that he do not know it all just western medicine guess he never read it in a medical book i do not know so we set up an ultrasound for the following week last week to check on my progress during my ultrasound i ask a lot of question about what wa on the screen she keep tell i with a smile that she could not tell i i ask what the red and blue wa and she do tell i that it wa the blood flow through my liver hmm blood flow that is good so i try something that i do every day with my liver a i watch the screen i send pure love to my liver immediately the red and blue just explode through my liver the blood flow increase big time there is my proof that there is a correlation between the brain and the liver not that i need proof the next day my doctor assistant call with the result i miss the call but listen to the message here what she say your result come up normal call with any question normal what how could it be normal i have cirrhosis what s normal about that i have a mass in my abdoman what s normal about that too i wa able to reach the doctor office and ask these question after a long conversation with my doctor she call i back and this is what she say your liver is healthy there is no scar all of your surround organ are in perfect health a well we do not need to check for cancer anymore because you do not have cirrhosis my head wa spin and i hug my liver well what about that mass below my liver she say the doctor do not know if you were bear with it or if your liver create it but it is a riedel lobe it is an extension of your right lobe which resemble a 3rd small liver lobe which give you even more healthy cell and well liver function i say to she so i am fine she giggle and say yes sarah you are just fine i thank she a if she have been the one who work for year to reverse the cirrhosis when i hang up the phone i say to my liver we do it i love you and i will always treat you kindly i have always hear that cirrhosis is irreversible because it is scar i have also hear that there is no disease that the body create that can not be reverse why would cirrhosis be an exception i have spend the last few year of my life

more than 80 percent of hcv genotype 1 treatment naive patient achieve sustain virologic response with twice daily telaprevir base regiman 04 nov 2009 tibotec announce result of a new study vx950 c208 which show that sustain virologic response svr wa achieve in more than 80 percent of treatment nave patient with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis c virus hcv who take telaprevir administer either every 8 hour or every 12 hour in combination with standard of care telaprevir an investigational stat c specifically target antiviral therapy for hepatitis c is being co develop by tibotec in collaboration with vertex pharmaceutical the study wa present today at the 60th annual meeting of the american association for the study of liver disease the liver meeting in the phase ii study which enrol 161 treatment nave genotype 1 patient rate of svr define a undetectable hcv rna at 24 week after completion of treatment range from 81 to 85 percent in patient treat with the every 8 hour telaprevir base regiman and 82 to 83 percent in patient treat with the every twelve hour regimen adverse event aes were similar to those observe in other trial with telaprevir and were mainly haematologic anaemia and cutaneous rash and pruritus in nature for the vast majority of patient these high svr rate were obtain with only 24 week of total treatment half the duration of current standard of care total duration of treatment wa decide use a criterion base on treatment response subject who achieve undetectable hcv rna at week 4 rapid virologic response or rvr and maintain this through week 20 were allow to stop all treatment at week 24 only 18 of subject were require to continue standard treatment up to week 48 approximately 180 million people worldwide are infect with hcv 1 the most common cause of liver transplant in europe 2 people with hcv genotype 1 currently face treatment limitation include a standard of care that cure just 40 to 50 percent of patient 3 without effective treatment hcv can lead to serious and fatal disease of the liver include liver cancer4 the datum present today show that a significant number of treatment nave genotype 1 hcv patient achieve sustain virologic response with telaprevir in combination with standard of care say professor patrick marcellin from hpital beaujon in clichy france telaprevir which directly target the virus by aim to block it replication could allow shortening treatment duration and increase cure rate in people with hcv compare to standard of care offer a new approach to treat hcv about telaprevir c208 study in treatment nave patient the phase iia open label randomise study evaluate telaprevir administer every eight hour or every 12 hour in combination with standard of care peg ifn alfa 2a pegasys and ribavirin copegus or peg ifn alfa2b pegintron and ribavirin rebetol in treatment nave patient with chronic genotype 1 hcv infection the objective of the trial wa to explore the efficacy safety tolerability pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic relationship of telaprevir when administer a 750 mg every eight hour or 1125 mg every 12 hour in combination with pegasys and copegus or pegintron and rebetol a total of 161 subject were randomise to the follow group a telaprevir 750 mg q8h with pegasys copegus tq8h peg2 a and 40 b telaprevir 750 mg q8h with pegintron rebetol tq8h peg2 b and 42 c telaprevir 1125 mg

therapy at the end of week 12 telaprevir dosing wa complete and subject continue on standard therapy only most subject achieve rapid virological response rvr undetectable at week 4 and remain undetectable until week 20 and were allow to stop all treatment at week 24 only 18 of subject were require to continue standard treatment up to week 48 follow are the efficacy finding a measure by sustained viral response rate svr 85 percent of patient take telaprevir 750 mg q8h with tq8h peg2 a achieve svr 81 percent of patient take telaprevir 750 mg q8h with tq8h peg2 b achieve svr 82 5 percent of patient take telaprevir 1125 mg q12h with tq12h peg2 a achieve svr 82 1 percent of patient take telaprevir 1125 mg q12h with tq12h peg2 b achieve svr the pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis show that total exposure to telaprevir measure a auc24h wa similar across all group aes were similar to those observe in other trial with telaprevir serious aes lead to permanent treatment discontinuation of all drug were mainly relate to rash 3 4 161 and anemia 2 3 161 for too long people with hcv have face treatment limitation necessitate a paradigm shift in hcv therapy say roger pomerantz md president of tibotec research and development tibotec is proud to apply it expertise in virology to discover develop and make available new therapy that target hcv in a different way about telaprevir there are currently two fully enrol pivotal phase 3 clinical trial examine telaprevir in genotype 1 hcv infected adult realize in treatment experienced patient and advance in

canada and mexico and have a collaboration with mitsubishi for commercialization in the far east about hcv with an estimate 180 million people infect worldwide and three to four million people newly infect each year hcv pose a significant burden on patient and society1 chronic infection with hcv a blood bear infectious disease that affect the liver can lead to liver cancer and other serious and fatal liver disease and is the most common cause of liver transplant in europe2 4 the current standard of care for hcv patient treatment with pegylate interferon combine with ribavirin only cure 40 to

i hope that someone will please answer since i am desperate with worry and can not stop cry i have been downright stupid i will admit i am 62 and have never have a colonoscopy out of fear of the anesthesia neither colon cancer nor polyp run in my family and i have lab do every 6 month last time 2 week ago and everything wa completely normal so i have not worry much about the colonoscopy however over the past couple of year i have have very light pink blood 2 or 3 time only on the toilet paper after an urgent bm and twice a tiny bit or red blood again on the paper i have small hemorrhoid but do not know if this is what cause the bleeding the reason why i feel so anxious is because a couple of month ago i start feel a light but nevertheless worrisome sensation which i think wa due to a small left ovarian cyst an on and off momentary cramp or twinge in that area but after ultrasound my gyn tell i that the cyst is too small and per the radiologist benign and recommend that i have a colonoscopy i never eat much fiber but have always been pretty regular i am now terrify because i have increase my fiber significantly and the frequency of bowel movement that i have should be much more than what i am have they are pasty and not a thick a they use to be sorry about the detail and do not come every day i do not feel a if i have go enough and the sensation on the left side is now more frequent and strong i eat a very low fat diet due to gallbladder issue but lead a very sedentary life and am a totally depressed mess do any of you think this could be colon cancer have you have similar symptom what wa your diagnosis if you were diagnose with cancer how long ago if you are old like i any problem with the procedure or anesthesia i have an appointment with a gi doctor in a couple of week and i imagine well schedule a colonoscopy i am so afraid that i have waste the life that god so generously give i,negative,negative

hello team just want to give a quick update i wa suppose to be get my first day of chemo today for bmt but the doctor at stanford throw we a curve ball last week my nih doctor have diagnose i with myeologenous hypereosinophilic syndrome chronic eosinophilic leukemia m he s cel this is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm mpn after my third bone marrow biopsy the doctor at stanford have a slightly different approach their diagnosis is systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological non mast cell disease that is likely chronic eosinophilic leukemia sm ahnmd cel in addition to the vast number of eosinophil in my bone marrow all of the biopsy have show aggregate of spindle shape mast cell my nih doc say that the differ diagnosis are semantic apparently eosinophil and mast cell hang in the same biological circle so in the absence of specific genetic clonality it is impossible to say whether my disease is primarily eosinophilic with secondary mastocytosis or primarily mastocytosis with secondary eosinophilia welcome to the wonderful world of have an uber rare disease more than six month in and still no diagnosis when i ask my doc for any sort of prognosis they all look at each other and shrug their shoulder with the exception of say that it will eventually kill i if we do not get it under control that could be one month or five year either way we are look at this new option a a blessing despite the uncertainty we are now establish a path to get this new drug midostaurin which is a tki that have have limited success in aml patient the doctor do not want to leave i off of any treatment a my absolute eosinophil count aec continue to slowly rise last cbc i have a wbc of 27 with aec at 20 5 they start i on hydroxyurea 1 gram day to see if that would lower the count a a bridge strategy to get to midostaurin midostaurin just finish phase ii trial and is not approve by the fda novartis is the drug company and they must say yes for compassionate use a well a the fda which may take 2 month or more then another two month to see if it work my doctor who wa primary investigator on the trial is unsure if it will work but think it is worth the risk to wait to try of the 116 patient in the trial 5 present in a similar manner sm ahnmd with cel 4 of those 5 have a complete resolution of their eosinophilia additionally for those of you follow the beat aml initiative my doctor also send off my blood for evaluation with jeff tyner use the same technique for aml genome mapping with the hope that another tki might be well suit for i than even midostaurin http www ll org who we are a new approach to drug discovery src1 35591 src2 a i have become more and more versed on this subject i am more and more encouraged by the progress in beat myeologenous leukemia of all form i am fairly certain that in 20 year leukemia of this variety will be treat first with induction then tki to vastly reduce chance of relapse and then bmt only in rare occasion cml have mostly been beat replace by take a pill with few side effect we can do this too with aml i would encourage all of you out there to write your doc to send any blood that may still be store to jeff tyner and the lab if pathway exist i remember dave tell i at the beginning of this journey for i that we are all part of the process to beat this disease i take that to heart and wholeheartedly agree what i would ask of the team for i personally is to continue pray specifically for the wisdom to make the right choice between bmt and drug therapy for protection of my heart and other organ from all the eosinophil for hydroxyurea to work a a bridge strategy and for midostaurin to be approve for i and to work if you have any experience with hydroxyurea or midostaurin i would appreciate any info a well we are so thankful for you all and pray for everyone here daily hope and health for everyone vr john,positive,positive

presence of xmrv in human population xmrv wa first identify by silverman et al 2 during effort to investigate a role for virus in prostate cancer at that time it wa know that a subset of individual with prostate cancer carry a susceptibility variant of the rnase l gene that impair innate immune response to viral infection but no viral candidate have been identify viral gene chip survey of prostate cancer detect sequence similar to murine leukemia virus a gammaretrovirus 2 mouse have been host to retrovirus for million of year and have accumulate hundred perhaps thousand of retrovirus in their genome a number of phylogenetic group with distinct genealogy and virologic characteristic have been identify 3 4 the viral sequence identify by silverman et al in prostate cancer were distinct but closely related to the xenotropic murine retrovirus and thus wa designate xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate retrovirus or xmrv singh et al 5 subsequently identify xmrv in patient with prostate cancer but find no association with rnase l variant because individual with chronic fatigue syndrome also have impair rnase l dependent response new study were initiate to investigate the presence of xmrv in patient with chronic fatigue syndrome in 2009 lombardi et al 6 analyze 101 sample from a chronic fatigue syndrome sample repository and detect xmrv in 67 of individual with severe chronic fatigue syndrome accord to center for disease control and prevention criterion xmrv wa also detect in 3 7 of control prompt concern about the possibility of iatrogenic or transfusion associate transmission molecular and biological characterization of xmrv have provide some support for it role in human disease human cell especially prostate cell are highly susceptible to an xmrv infectious molecular clone 710 like other replication competent murine leukemia virus xmrv do not appear to encode an oncogene and is detect in some but not all prostate cancer cell in tumor tissue suggest oncogenic mechanism more complex than those use by other gammaretroviruse that is oncogene activation or promoter insertion despite close similarity with xenotropic virus xmrv is genetically distinct from all know xenotropic murine leukemia virus have a 24 nucleotide deletion in gag and a 2 nucleotide deletion in the long terminal repeat analysis of xmrv sequence from different source have reveal limited genetic diversity among patient because retrovirus diversity is dependent on cycle of error prone viral replication the absence of xmrv genetic variability suggest that multiple cycle of infection are not take place in human this lack of genetic diversity is in stark contrast to human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection in which viral diversity rapidly accumulate instead xmrv appear more similar to human t lymphotropic virus htlv a virus that infect million but have low genetic diversity because it undergo limited cycle of virus replication after infection and is maintain largely by division of provirus contain cell xmrv is readily susceptible to hypermutation by the apobec system 11 suggest that xmrv infection would likely take place in cell with low or absent apobec activity take together these datum suggest that xmrv have zoonotic origin in mouse but have replicate to only to a limited degree in human follow the first report of xmrv in the united state new study of patient with chronic fatigue syndrome or prostate cancer were initiate that search for the presence of xmrv in geographically diverse area a flurry of publication in the past year have uncover major complexity in xmrv research several large study of individual with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome in germany the netherlands mexico and england do not detect any 1214 or detect rare 1517 evidence of xmrv xmrv have also not been detect in individual with other immune deficiency such a hiv infection 18 in the united state arnold et al 19 detect anti xmrv antibodie in 27 of individual with prostate cancer and schlaberg et al 5 report infection in 23 of patient with prostate cancer and 4 of control in contrast switzer et al 20 report no detectable xmrv in united state patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and 51 normal volunteer and 56 or blood donor and 121 lo et al 21 recently report the presence of mouse retroviral sequence in 86 5 of patient with chronic fatigue syndrome add to the mystery the sequence amplify from these patient were distinct from xmrv and appear to be more closely related to different murine endogenous retrovirus in this issue of the journal several new study have ass the presence of xmrv in human population danielsen et al 22 extract prostate tissue from individual who have radical prostatectomy at baylor university medical center houston texas they detect xmrv gag and env by polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification in sample contain 105 cell from 22 8 of these patient a proportion of xmrv positivity that is similar to that in several study of prostate cancer in the united state that do detect xmrv 5 19 in 57 individual tumor and normal tissue wa available for analysis intriguingly xmrv wa detect in both normal and tumor tissue suggest that xmrv do not target prostate tumor cell specifically in addition the finding that xmrv positivity wa coincident in normal and tumor tissue from specific patient and not uniformly distribute among normal and tumor sample in the patient population suggest that the xmrv signal they detect wa not a random amplification event two other report in this month journal find no evidence of xmrv in different patient population barne et al 23 investigate patient with hiv or hepatitis c virus infection from switzerland or the united kingdom analysis of 230 patient sample reveal no evidence of xmrv by dna pcr in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from hiv infected and 84 or hepatitis c virus infect and 67 individual and no xmrv rna in plasma of hiv infect person and 79 in addition enzyme link immunospot assay demonstrate no response to overlap xmrv gag peptide henrich et al 24 survey xmrv in patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and severe symptom and 32 recent transplant recipient and 26 hiv infection and 43 rheumatoid arthritis and 97 and match control with use of pcr technology capable of detect 10 copy of xmrv in 1105 cell no xmrv wa detect use this sensitive assay in any patient from these datum the author calculate the prevalence of xmrv in these population to be,neutral,neutral
my 80 year old mom wa just tell she have a fuzzy spot on her lung ct scan she just have surgery for peripheral artery disease and the spot wa discover during a pre test scan she is very healthy still work full time and is on her foot 6 to 8 hour a day do not cough not short of breath and quit smoking 30 year ago she do have pneumonia about 50 year ago what could this be other than lung cancer from what i have read it most likely is cancer and since it is a spot and not a mass it is still relatively small,neutral,negative
if there wa a new disease out there that wa make people really sick the center for disease control would get a ton of government money to study it and figure out how to stop it adultery is that new disease and it is affect million of american child family and not just celebrity athelete with sex addiction we all know someone whose life have been tear apart by adultery whether it is b c mm om or ow and it have reach such proportion that it is not just the womanizer skank whore or other user it is your good friend neighbor sister or brother someone at church people that would have never think in a million year that they would be susceptible to this new disease so what is being do about it i think some really smart people should be give a lot of money to figure this out how about a new tax on the pornography industry to fund it they use money from the sale of cigarette to study lung cancer,neutral,neutral

have a port place in her chest for the chemo christmas eve she will have an mri of her brain to see if the cancer have spread there she have small cell cancer that accord to the oncologist can be put in remission but can not be cure we trust the oncologist but we also trust that if god want she cure she will be chemo start next tuesday so for now we just need to stay the course thank you for all the prayer comment letter and to those who have stop by the house it have all mean a lot to we december 28 2015 so we meet with the cancer center again today meredith anno wa tell information that i have know for over a week first the good news the mri on her skull reveal she have a brain i know total shock on my end here science prove that a light can shine in the dark ok ok back to the serious stuff she have no cancer in her brain currently this is a huge relief the pet scan do last week wa not a nice she have cancer throughout her body in her bone include her right clavicle her femur her spine and many other location she start her chemo treatment tomorrow morning and she have one thing she say constantly and i am behind she on it completely she is go to fight and that god is with we still no matter what and that he is still god december 30 2015 togetherfighting january 4 2016 have a bad day today meredith is extremely nauseous cold and clammy skin call the illinois cancer care and they want she right in she is here get iv fluid thank you everyone she wa extremely dehydrate today and require iv fluid to rehydrate she she have have a much well afternoon than the beginning of the day we get home around 3 pm today january 5 2016 sit at home with my good friend realize how small she have get togetherfighte january 10 2016 and it have begin i watch meredith get up out of a chair today and see hair fall to the ground i have she sit at the kitchen table and i brush her hair only to get a lot more out the chemo have make her hair start to fall out she start to cry and while i understand i tell she it is just hair just a baptism is an outward sign of christ inside hair loss is an outward sign of the chemo she is still beautiful and lose her hair will not change that togetherfighting togetherfighting you know when i first start type that phrase back at the first photo of meredith and i it wa to let she know that i am here for she no matter what it wa to tell she she is not alone in this situation and that i will fight for she because i love she over the last two week i have watch and listen to so many people and realize although i may be late to the realization that it have come to mean so much more i have this misconstrue idea to start out that this wa about meredith and i and that nothing else matter in this fight i could not have been more wrong there is so much more in that little phrase than just meredith and i you see it is all of you also our friend and family your prayer hug well wish note gift and even the meal that have been drop off at the house we are not in this with each other you are all in this with we we are all togetherfighte i can not express what that knowledge have mean to i once i discover it i always know god wa with the both of we and that he would not leave we the outpouring of love we have receive since this fight start have been simply amazing the simple thing mean so much from the lady who come to help i clean the house to the family who have provide dinner to our i am not name name a to who have do what because they have not do this for their glory but for christ and their reward will come i sit each night once the kid go to bed and meredith is rest and i listen to music and cry yes i am a grown man and i will admit to cry i will not do it in front of she but i do cry it is unavoidable i am not hide it from she i mean i am here admit it know she will read this and so will the kid my job is to be strong in front of she and weak when she is sleep my weakness allow i to lean on god even more to keep i strong when she is awake i learn several year ago when i wa go through the hard part of my own medical issue that writing wa a great way for i to vent i am write this because many have ask my feeling because i am not the good at express they i do not allow myself to express they because show my weakness is not an easy thing ask other for help do not come natural to i i have try my whole life to be self sufficient i have learn in the past that i am not in control and that god is i have wonder through this event if my sickness in the past wa to prepare i for this now through all of you he have been show we his love and try to prove to i that we are not alone so the long and the short of this message is thank you thank you for being there for care and for pray with all of you she will beat this cancer in her body because we are all togetherfighte january 12 2016 so the decision have been make tonight that on thursday meredith anno will be cut her hair off now there are a couple of option here i can do a cut her hair then shave it off myself b take she somewhere that will not overcharge i to shave she bald i have no problem do the job myself i am just scared that since cut hair is not my profession i may hurt she more than help she her decision to shave it off is so that the chemo will not tell she when it will take it away she is show she still have a say and control in what happen i personally think this is a great statement to make a it show she is still fight so i am open to suggestion a to who to use on thursday or if it is well do by i i am all ear and with you all we are still togetherfighte january 14 2016 it is finish togetherfighte january 18 2016 at st francis er department meredith go in for lab today at illinois cancer care and a visit with the doctor because it have been a tough weekend she have fall a few time at home and have been really weak her liver profile is extremely elevated and they send she to st francis in peoria right now this is all i know will update when i can she look well tonight than she do this morning meredith have been admit to icu at st francis hospital in peoria il i am head back there now to stay the night at the hospital to be near she have to come home get the kid settle and grab some thing will update more later once i am back at her side ok it is now 11 52 prime minister and meredith anno is rest back in the icu today have been a very long day and i am go to talk about thing that i have keep silent till now so please bear with i meredith have been really sick since last thursday she have been weak and fall in the house i have do my good to take care of she and get she through the weekend till she go to the cancer center today unfortunately i miss the fact that she wa slowly fade to a yellow jaundice tint in her skin life is funny you spend so much time close to someone that the subtle change are easily overlook after have her lab this morning it wa find that her liver profile wa extremely high she wa immediately send to st francis hospital in peoria il now i sit all these hour later know few new detail one her liver have a bile duct blockage that they do an mri to find two her kidney and fail and may need to do dialysis last but certainly not least she is too weak to start chemo again tomorrow tomorrow is a new day with new challenge from possible dialysis to surgery however i am only a prayer away from sleep so i will sign off from here while i am still coherent enough january 19 2016 togetherfighting tuesday evening update today we have speak with every form of doctor that i think can exist except doctor who which would have been great well the kidney doctor do not want to do any dialysis at this point because she is filter some fluid and create urine the gastrointestinal doctor have find a bile duct that is narrow that is cause the blockage however the procedure need to do the surgery will require anesthesia the anesthesiologist will not allow the procedure unless her level come down level that are raise partially by the blockage that the procedure will correct now please pay attention i say partially she wa diagnose today a have tumor lysis syndrome basically the chemo is attack the tumor the tumor are shrink but they for a lack of a well phrase are explode thus release toxin into her system that is also elevate her liver profile so for now we wait i have have to speak with palliative care and have all the end of life conversation that i do not want to have today i am tired and i just want to see my kid and let they see their mother please know that neither one of we have stop fight we are just tired today and stress i may not respond to all text or facebook post but i will at least read they togetherfighte january 20 2016 wednesday 1 20 16 update well what a rollercoaster today journey have been at 2 30 i am awake in the lounge by her nurse say she is request i i go to her side a i am not allow to sleep in her room and we have a funny conversation hi shmily i hurt do you ask for med or tell your nurse no i sort of scold she for not talk to her nurse then she hit i with it why have you lie to your nurse because i want to see you before the med put i to sleep love later shortly after 5 m i find out her level come down to the safe range and we just have to wait gastrointestinal and procedure here we come have you ever look at the bright shine sun before the storm cloud how over the cloud you can see ray of hope shine down enter the storm cloud first the kidney doctor come in to tell we that her kidney have fail follow this by the micu doctor give we straight forward no beating around the bunch information because he want we to have a fully inform decision process after his chat the gastrointestinal group come in and say even though her level are down they have pull the procedure from the table it can not be offer talk about a kick in the gut well the micu doctor give we a promise to fill we in completely and he deliver on it after everyone else finish he bring his computer in and show meredith and i what it look like her liver is not just shut down it do not exist she have a liver mass that is 100 tumor the amount of cancer in her liver have triple since december he also inform we that the oncologist have decide there is nothing more they can do her reaction to the slight pain medication now is like a snow effect a her body can not filter out he me i have been name surrogate a we never have a medical power of attorney i also have to make dnr decision today and i am scared so now in a little over 10 hour my beautiful wife will be transfer out of micu to the hospice house here in peoria to be a comfortable a she can till the end at her stage of liver and kidney loss we will be lucky if she is still here by sunday i am write all this because i can not sleep because my heart is in a room away from i and i am with our 3 kid in a waiting room wonder if they will see their mother in the morning this war seem so unfair 5 week from diagnosis to this but i trust god and i know he have his reason he can still heal she but if he choose to take her home to be heal then that is his choice for now i am log off a i am very tired and just need to cry in my sleep still and always togetherfighte january 21 2016 thursday 1 21 16 update well today wa move day we are now locate at the

we are enter a period of personalized medicine where assessment of a person medical history and genetic background will impact treatment it wa not always like this 20 year ago the treatment wa surgery for stage 1 chemotherapy for stage 4 and would be basically the same at a local hospital a a major research facility today important variation are see base upon the cancer type squamous cell adenocarcinoma cellular issue egfr alk positive smoking history and other factor the goal is obviously to increase your chance of get the right treatment have the great chance of work here are my thought 1 adenocarcinoma a great number of adeno patient have cellular mutation such a egfr epidermal growth factor receptor and alk and the adeno patient will want to check new treatment 2 egfr positive tarceva is an important drug for egfr positive patient show an impressive 60 response rate adeno patient non smoker and light former smoker le than 15 pack year year smoke x pack per day are more likely to be egfr positive 3 alk positive crizotinib is an important drug for alk positive patient who are likewise more likely to be non smoker or light former smoker with adenocarcinoma alk and egfr are generally mutually exclusive combine they show a substantial percentage of non smoker will have one of these mutation and testing make sense to get the right target treatment 4 squamous cell patient smoker and alk or egfr fairly heavy smoker and those with squamous cell tumor are le likely to be egfr positive or alk positive that lead to the question of whether they should be test and whether insurance will pay for it study of crizotinib show a few patient who were smoker or have squamous cell tumor and similar result with see with tarceva egfr 5 testing one question is how intrusive is the testing the good way to get tissue is through a biopsy but that carry risk a significant surgery le but still intrusive is a bronchoscope which involve secure tissue with local anesthesia and a small sampling some have study test through unintrusive method if testing can be do without risk it make sense to get a more complete profile 6 moderate and heavy smoker and particular mutation smoker are more likely to have the kras mutation and cox 2 mutation kra and egfr are at the opposite end and one generally have one but not the other anti cox 2 drug include celebrex and the withdraw drug vioxx while vioxx may pose some long term risk for heart issue if it can play a role in attack cancer that may be worth long term potential risk at least with advanced lung cancer 7 anecdotal evidence it is tempting to look at someone else treatment and say if it work for they perhaps it will work for i however if the genetic profile and drug efficacy vary it may be compare apple and orange thus it is tough to use the 60 response rate of tarceva for egfr positive patient primarily non smoker and light former smoker a a basis for use the drug for egfr negative smoker who have a response rate in the 9 10 range some have justify tarceva base upon it capacity for disease stabilization and symptom relief while these are potentially important criterion they create a risk of have datum misinterpret or even manipulate those advocate testing and personalize evaluation can be on the opposite end of drug company who for marketing reason may want to suggest the wide possible market for their drug 8 second line treatment and personalized evaluation target treatment may become ineffective a the tumor restore it aberrant signal for egfr positive patient the t790 and meet mutation can make tarceva ineffective new drug are being develop to combat resistance and restore effectiveness 9 source goodle scholar and pub med contain almost all medical abstract and many full article it make sense to research alternative if possible 10 approach with physician in my view the patient or family advocate can have an important role with research outside a major research facility a general oncologist may see 100 type of cancer and can not be familiar with every new research development if he see 25 patient per day one do need to be respectful and properly deferential not you forget to mention this important drug i find on the internet but can i ask you about this particular drug 11 overall cure perhaps a drug will be develop to combat all type of lung cancer or even all type of cancer for many that is unlikely and we see continue research a identify particular characteristic for treatment of certain type and subtype of lung cancer and address part of this disease,neutral,neutral

2 win drug test one expect and one a surprise article tool sponsor by by andrew pollack publish november 2 2007 an experimental drug from vertex pharmaceutical help cure more than 60 percent of patient with a tough to treat form of hepatitis c accord to datum to be present at a medical meeting that start today skip to next paragraph relate time health guide hepatitis c the result eagerly await by wall street a well a by doctor represent the high cure rate yet report for the condition and the treatment wa accomplish in half the usual time but vertex might have to share a bit of the limelight with romark laboratory a tiny privately hold company that already sell a drug call alinia that is use to treat diarrhea cause by certain parasite but that suddenly is emerge a a potential treatment for hepatitis c in a presentation that have escape the attention of wall street though it is to be make at the same meeting researcher are to report that alinia help cure a many a 79 percent of hepatitis c patient although they have a form of the virus that might be slightly easy to treat than the type vertex take on there will be skepticism because this have come out of right field say dr emmet b keeffe chief of hepatology at stanford who is a consultant to romark but dr keeffe say that he have overcome his own initial skepticism and that the result were pretty exciting both development expert say will need to be follow up by large trial but the progress could be important for patient at least three million american are think to be infect with the hepatitis c virus and the number of case of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer cause by the virus is rise the exist treatment a combination of two drug alpha interferon and ribavirin can cause debilitate side effect like flulike symptom anemia and depression the treatment for type 1 hepatitis c the hard to treat form that account for 70 percent of the case in the united state take nearly a year so the hunt for new drug have been intense and vertex a publicly trade company base in cambridge mass is widely acknowledge a the front runner it pill call telaprevir or vx 950 interfere with a viral enzyme this is how most aid drug work but it is a new approach for hepatitis c while vertex have previously show that telaprevir can sharply reduce virus level in patient blood the new datum to be present at the meeting an annual gathering of the american association for the study of liver disease in boston is the first strong signal of how many patient could be cure in a midstage trial in the united state of 250 previously untreated patient 61 percent of the people who receive telaprevir in addition to the two standard drug have no detectable virus in their blood 24 week after the end of the treatment a vertex executive say doctor consider that an effective cure in a european trial of 323 patient about 65 percent of those who get the three drug combination have no detectable virus 12 week after the end of treatment both rate are high than the 40 to 50 percent cure rate now typical for type 1 hepatitis c use the standard drug alone perhaps a significant doctor say the treatment take 24 week instead of the usual 48 that mean patient would have to endure the side effect of interferon and ribavirin for a short time these are exciting finding say dr ira m jacobson of weill cornell medical college who will present the result of the american trial at the meeting and is a consultant to vertex but the number are pretty much what wall street expect and many more people get the three drug stop treatment because of side effect than those get the standard therapy the trial cure rate for the standard therapy are not yet available the romark datum come from a study in egypt of only 96 previously untreated patient alinia also know a nitazoxanide have previously been test there a a treatment for parasite of the patient who receive alinia along with the two standard drug 79 percent have no detectable virus 12 week after the end of treatment that compare with 43 percent in the control group receive the standard treatment while the total treatment last the usual 48 week the patient receive the two standard drug for only 36 week the patient have type 4 hepatitis c which is rare in the united state some expert say type 4 wa slightly easy to treat than type 1 romark which is base in tampa fla and have about 20 million in annual revenue have begin a trial in the united state the drug effectiveness against hepatitis c wa discover almost by accident when test a a treatment for parasite the drug show sign it wa counter liver infection dr keeffe who is research how the romark drug work say that because alinia is already on the market and appear to have few side effect some doctor might prescribe it off label to treat hepatitis c it cost about 30 a day for the two pill need it is legal for doctor to prescribe medicine for use other than those the food and drug administration have approve but a drug maker can not promote it medicine for those off label use before formal approval were all look for well therapy for our patient and this look like a very benign thing to do dr keeffe say but dr jacobson of cornell say that would be very premature,neutral,neutral

i m sorry if anyone think that this post sound angry but maybe in a way i am i m hurt more than i ever think possible my mother in law lose her battle against liver cancer she also have a infection call mrsa that is apparently pick up in hospital and they think will be the next pandemic i ahve to believe it because every floor i go on to with she have sign on the room state the person s wa in isolation what make i damn angry though is that many patient are leave unattended by nurse or they take their sweet damn time get to they because the nurse do not want to continually garb up and put on the clothing and so on need for enter a room where the person is in isolation near the end of mom battle i could not even leave the hospital because the nurse were not care for she properly how do i know i call the hospital one night because i wa awaken by waht i think wa mom call i for help when i call the hospital i could hear she scream for help and the damn nurse tell i she wa being noisy look just because people get old do not mean they loose it and start get noisy i wonder at time how many people have have elderly family in the hospital who have ignore a a result of this belief and the patient have suffer but do to their health could not tell we i finally refuse to leave even when they bring in security at night one night they bring in a particularly large set man in wa kind of funny actually at the time it wa not here wa a huge bulk of man come in to remove a small woman barely 5 feettall and he back down only because of my voice and what he see in my eye above the mask he tell the nurse that he do not think the poilce could even get i out and to think of it a extra help i tell they that they should do what they do well sit around the station eat candy and joke about the various elderly patient i speak to administration the following day they agree to allow i to stay and alot of nurse get in very real trouble because i use my cell phone to tape their antic at the station mom room wa directly across from it look no one that stay with their family is a hero or deserve recognition or a way to go just please take notice of the condition of teh hospital when your elderly family member are there please mom wa not the only one there were many elderly people on the floor with alzheimer cancer and so on and the nurse sit on their fat little fanny imitate they or talk about thi plan holiday and so on instead of care for they i begin stop family member in the hall way and talk to they about it it get to the point i would not even let mom go for a test alone mom wa a fantastic person she love everyone she come in contact with even in the end you could see her caring side because she want i to take the feather comforter i have bring she in to the baby in the nursey below i have a very hard time try to convince she that i have take they other one she often say she have give birth too my son but have to child and then when my child come along and my grandchild she wa overjoy my eld daughter her husband and the baby live with she so that she always have someone with she a she grow old because she walk with a walker and have a difibrulator in her heart she love have the baby there i feel so bad that the baby could not see she in the end but due to the mrsa infection we could not subject she to it and mom would never have allow it a week before

describe something special like the sail boat and when we see it in a book at the funeral home we know it wa to be the one it wa discontinue but a always i refuse to take no a a answer this is something she teach i never take no a a answer she is also the one who use to always tell i when i wa battle breast cancer there are no such thing a breast cancer victim there are only survivor the subject title say why do we do this to those we love and it is because i can not understand why we allow our pet to die with dignanty peace and without the horrible agony that i have witness a few time yet we force our human love one to endure long month and sometimes year of agony because we can not let go we call it inhuman to want to see their suffering end maybe we are inhuman but because we allow they to go out like this when they do not deserve it we call our pet animal but maybe when the word animal wa choose it should have been give to we and the word human should have been give to they mom want i to write a book about her life in holland during the war and then her life here in the end she look so sad at i the one day and tell i taht her book would never be writen i tell she it

if dietary and lifestyle change can help prevent the multilication of cancer cell easy medication for i to swallow john hopkins update this is an extremely good article everyone should read it after year of tell people chemotherapy is the only way to try try being the key word to eliminate cancer john hopkins is finally start to tell you there is an alternative way cancer update from john hopkins 1 every person have cancer cell in the body these cancer cell do not show up in the standard test until they have multiply to a few billion when doctor tell cancer patient that there are no more cancer cell in their body after treatment it just mean the test are unable to detect the cancer cell because they have not reach the detectable size 2 cancer cell occur between 6 to more than 10 time in a person lifetime 3 when the person immune system is strong the cancer cell will be destroy and prevent from multiply and form tumor 4 when a person have cancer it indicate the person have nutritional deficiency these could be due to genetic but also to environmental food and lifestyle factor 5 to overcome the multiple nutritional deficiency change diet to eat more adequately and healthy 4 5 time day and by include supplement will strengthen the immune system 6 chemotherapy involve poison the rapidly grow cancer cell and also destroy rapidly grow healthy cell in the bone marrow gastrointestinal tract and so on and can cause organ damage like liver kidney heart lung and so on 7 radiation while destroy cancer cell also burn scar and damage healthy cell tissue and organ 8 initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size however prolong use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction 9 when the body have too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromise or destroy hence the person can succumb to various kind of infection and complication 10 chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cell to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy surgery can also cause cancer cell to spread to other site 11 an effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cell by not feed it with the food it need to multiply cancer cell feed on a sugar substitute like nutrasweet equal spoonful and so on are make with aspartame and it is harmful a well natural substitute would be manuka honey or molasse but only in very small amount table salt have a chemical add to make it white in color well alternative is bragg amino or sea salt b milk cause the body to produce mucus especially in the gastro intestinal tract cancer feed on mucus by cut off milk and substitute with unsweetened soy milk cancer cell are being starve c cancer cell thrive in an acid environment a meat base diet is acidic and it is good to eat fish and a little other meat like chicken meat also contain livestock antibiotic growth hormone and parasite which are all harmful especially to people with cancer d a diet make of 80 fresh vegetable and juice whole grain seed nut and a little fruit help put the body into an alkaline environment about 20 can be from cook food include bean fresh vegetable juice provide live enzyme that are easily absorb and reach down to cellular level within 15 minute to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cell to obtain live enzyme for build healthy cell try and drink fresh vegetable juice most vegetable include be an sprout and eat some raw vegetable 2 or 3 time a day enzyme are destroy at temperature of 104 degree f 40 degree c e avoid coffee tea and chocolate which have high caffeine green tea is a well alternative and have cancer fighting property water well to drink purified water or filter to avoid know toxin and heavy metal in tap water distil water is acidic avoid it 12 meat protein is difficult to digest and require a lot of digestive enzyme undigested meat remain in the intestine become putrefied and lead to more toxic buildup 13 cancer cell wall have a tough protein cover by refrain from or eat le meat it free more enzyme to attack the protein wall of cancer cell and allow the body killer cell to destroy the cancer cell 14 some supplement build up the immune system ip6 flor ssence essiac anti oxidant vitamin mineral efas and so on to enable the body own killer cell to destroy cancer cell other supplement like vitamin e are know to cause apoptosis or program cell death the body normal method of dispose of damage unwanted or unneeded cell 15 cancer is a disease of the mind body and spirit a proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor anger un forgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit learn to relax and enjoy life 16 cancer cell can not thrive in an oxygenate environment exercise daily and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level oxygen therapy is another mean employ to destroy cancer cell 1 no plastic container in micro 2 no water bottle in freezer 3 no plastic wrap in microwave john hopkins have recently send this out in it newsletter this

i see many ask about blood test and the importance of they i really like find this piece i clip out of and article a it simplify the explanation of different blood test to find out what is go on in your liver by burton m berkson md miss phd in my opinion there are four laboratory test that really tell a doctor what is go on in the liver the first is the platelet count it is important because a liver inflammation and scar progress the platelet count go down so the platelet count is a very helpful indirect indication of liver health and a rise in platelet count is and indication of a healing liver i believe that the albumin level is the most important liver function test a diseased liver can only produce a small amount of albumin so a person with severe liver disease have a low albumin level and a the liver improve the albumin level rise the alt is a liver enzyme that result from damage to the liver it normally go up and down from day to day however a downward trend may suggest an improvement of liver function interestingly enough in case of severe liver disease the alt is very low because most liver cell have been kill off the prothrombin time is a very important tool for measure liver health because a sick liver can not produce much of the clotting factor and this the prothrombin time a time it take the blood to clot is elongate in severe liver disease a the liver regenerate the prothrombin time shorten,neutral,neutral
