it is almost 6 month since my pes immediately follow my gallbladder removal back in may I have been on lovenox and for the most part it have been fine I go to see my hematologist the other day and he feel since all my b w was negative for any blood clot disorder that I should get off on the 15th I am very scared about this and try to convince he to just let I stay on he say he feel a year was too aggressive and I should trust that mine was a provoke clot from surgery he say he would have I get on they again if I ever need surgery but otherwise the risk to being on with bruise bleeding and so on were high then I being off it I have a ct scan at 3 month and it show my clot have less then 10 leave he say that was good and I should assume that since it have been 3more month that they are go he think another ct is too much radiation although he do say if clot were still present he would not take I off the lovenox but that make I mad since he will not do another ct I was wonder what you all think it seem that so many end up back on here with new clot after get off is it that few that actually have just one clot and do fine I know I will completely be insane after get off and most likely end up in the er want a ct scan I know that sound nutty I have 3 small kid and am help my father who have liver cancer I just can not handle the stress right now my primary care doctor agree with he and my pulmonologist think I should have only been on 3 month this is all just so confusing and frightening and I just do not know how to feel about it thank for any advice you can give,negative,negative

hello all first time poster if thing go well hopefully last look for some info guidance on a worrisome finding here go 37 yr old male very physically active healthy diet moderate drinker all that good stuff however smoker vaper for about the past 20 year I smoke cigarette from 18 30 then transition to vape because like a lot of people at the time I think it would be a less harmful alternative when everybody start get sick from it this year I decide to see a doc and make sure I was all good I was not experience any specific symptom but he give I a chest x ray and take blood and urine sample nonetheless that was about a month ago the blood and urine sample show across the board good health however the chest x ray reveal what he describe as a small nodule on the middle left lung and he could not tell what it was so he order a ct scan I just have the ct scan today doc call back with a recommend follow up appointment to go over the result in a week as well as a recommend follow up ct scan in another 6 month I am try to interpret what all that could mean and the suspense is kill I I feel like the 6 month follow up ct scan might be encourage that make it sound like maybe monitor the thing is a good idea but arrange for immediate procedure is not yet necessary I am also choose to take my exceptionally good blood and urine result as an encouraging sign and for what it is worth the x ray tech also tell I I have huge lung which accord to he is for some reason apparently a good thing I have virtually none of the common symptom for lung cancer except that I have now been experience mild chest pain and discomfort in the exact area more or less that he tell I the nodule was discover and I am a bit concern this pain and discomfort could be a few thing first of all it start at the exact time I get the x ray result and I have a tendency toward mild hypochondria psychosomatic episode so it is entirely possible that upon hear potentially bad news my brain start make up symptom for a disease that is not there this chest pain discomfort is so mild it is also entirely possible that it was present before and I just never notice it until the doc give I incentive to start pay more attention a third possibility is that upon hear the result of the x ray I immediately give up vaping and have only cave in and smoke about 5 cigarette in the past month so perhaps I am just feel some side effect from not inhale garbage into my lung daily for the first time in 20 year a few other possibility could be that I am occasionally prone to heartburn gas problem and also as an active athletic type with an injury history I am somewhat prone to all sort of minor bodily ache and pain that I tend to usually ignore until give a reason not to ignore they or of course another possibility is that it is lung cancer I am just try to be realistic and consider all my option I have get a week of anxiety to deal with here while I wait for my follow up visit with my doctor to go over the ct result so here I am desperately hope for a reassuring opinion or two from a group of stranger familiar with this potential condition,negative,negative

hi newbie here in browse the internet last night I find something interesting and just want to post it here gluten and casein as factor responsible for the characteristic disease of chronic hepatitis c not everyone expose to hcv develop a chronic infection the rate of natural clearance is unknown because most people are not aware they are infect until the condition become chronic one know factor in chronic infection with viral hepatitis a b is selenium deficiency in malnourished population celiac disease the most easily diagnose form of gluten toxicity is know to cause selenium deficiency in well feed population celiac also cause a general deficiency of many antioxidant protein and mineral and vitamin there is a strong association between hcv and celiac disease in many population test there is an even strong association between interferon alpha treatment and celiac disease interferon alpha is the cytokine that trigger celiac disease naturally celiac disease is only the easy to diagnose of the gluten sensitivity syndrome it result in destruction of the intestinal cell vilii damage which can be detect on biopsy even so celiac is seriously underdiagnosed it is likely that anyone in new zealand with the symptom of celiac disease who is hcv positive will be tell that their symptom are due to hepatitis c testing for celiac will happen slowly and most likely not at all unless the patient insist and test for other form of gluten sensitivity is unlikely milder form of gluten sensitivity might only disrupt those gut receptor responsible for function such as immune regulation especially endorphin receptor mineral transport or absorption of specific vitamin antibody may form to the proline rich gluten gliadin and casein sequence release by peptide digestion which enter the bloodstream which then attack the proline rich collagenous tissue promote disease such as liver fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis it so happen that the auto immune symptom associate with celiac and gluten sensitivity disease include liver and gall bladder disease and which usually resolve slowly on a strict gluten and dairy free diet are essentially identical to the various syndrome see in chronic hep c especially during or after interferon alpha treatment syndrome cause by gluten in celiac disease include fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver gall bladder obstruction insulin resistance thyroiditis sicca syndrome dry eye and mouth vasculitis brain fog poor memory confusion depression fibromyalgia fatigue optic neuritis deficiency of selenium magnesium zinc chromium deficiency of fat soluble vitamin a d e k deficiency of those vitamin convert in the intestine include folate b6 anaemia thrombocytopenic purpurea low platelet due to autoimmunity gi disturbance diarrhea steatorrhea these symptom are aggravate by the nutrient deficiency especially antioxidant magnesium and chromium deficiency associate with gluten sensitivity in fact the symptom of both hep c and celiac disease are often partially but significantly relive by supplementation of these nutrient especially when anti inflammatory botanical curcumin grape seed ginkgo milk thistle and so on are add other treatment effective against hep c have obvious link to gluten sensitivity for example low dose naltrexone may exert its beneficial effect on cancer autoimmune disease and viral immunity by repair damage do to endorphin receptor by gluten and casein digest similarly enzyme therapy for cancer may work by promote the complete digestion of gluten and casein exorphin and the ketogenic diet for cancer may work by eliminate grain and lower insulin level and hence inflammation rather than merely by deprive cancer cell of glucose exorphin are chemical find in protein digest the peptide produce by pepsin digestion of food protein which have an affinity for endorphin receptor endorphin are the messenger of emotion and gluten sensitivity is very often find in schizophrenia autism adhd asperger and the various mood disorder however the endorphin system also regulate the immune system and defect of endorphin and endorphin receptor are associate with cancer and autoimmune disease as well as aid endorphin also regulate gut motility the well know constipate effect of cheese is an opioid effect even people who have no gluten antibody and no leaky gut which allow gluten digest to enter the bloodstream in especially large dose are influence by the opioid effect of exorphin at the local gut level diagnose non celiac gluten and casein sensitivity without exclusion diet is difficult if not impossible commonly in new zealand a scratch test for gluten is the doctor first choice this is bad than useless because we are not talk about an allergy to gluten at all though these do exist when gluten milk and maize are digest in the stomach by pepsin and hydrochloric acid a variety of peptide are release the exact combination of peptide that might appear in the gut vary with the individual the state of his digestion and the strain of wheat milk or maize consume gliadomorphin is a characteristic wheat exorphin beta casomorphin 7 is think to be the most toxic milk exorphin and the maize exorphin have not yet been identify autoimmune reaction to antigenic peptide is not the only way in which exorphin can harm we so the current insistence on immunological testing seem limited also current test do not include antibody to every possible peptide digest of gluten this would probably be impossible luckily no one need to eat grain our ancestor get along in well health without they for million of year grain consumption is a comparatively recent phenomenon in human history very recent indeed in some case in northern europe and in colonized oceania it is a habit of mere century if that in part of the world where grain eating go back long for example the eastern mediterranean there is a high rate of adaptation this do not mean that individual adapt to grain individual die young or become sterile if they lack the more grain adapt gene in order that the race might adapt but this still do not rule out the disease of late life study of remain of grain dependent society such as rome and ancient egypt show that so call modern disease such as arthritis and cancer were prolific there it is trendy to think that such disease result from technology radiation pesticide food processing and that it can be prevent with an organic vegetarian diet the sad truth is that in most case wheat and milk even organic wheat and milk product of the old agricultural revolution are do more harm than those trace of the modern industrial revolution that we can not avoid if our immune system and our detox enzyme can not cope with some new agricultural chemical the most likely reason is the disruption they have receive from the old agricultural chemical gluten and casein it was also agriculture not food processing that first place man in a guilty relationship with his food pre agricultural man kill to eat and take from the forest and have ritual that make peace with the animal and the plant he take from these bounteous god not from captive creature agricultural man kill for money pay other to kill for he and burn down the forest to plant his cash crop if this was original sin then the wage of sin have indeed been death it is customary to blame lead pipe for the decline of rome the roman people were highly wheat addict they would riot for bread bread and circus was the formula for keep they happy they were so addicted that the state find it more convenient to supply bread for free like a methadone clinic for the opiate of the people today the state oversee the addition of gluten milk and maize to an ever widen range of food so that a mere bread shortage is not likely to cause withdrawal this is probably not intentional addict tend to assume that everyone want to share their habit in the case of rome wheat and lead may have have a synergistic toxicity both lead poisoning and wheat consumption tend to reduce iron and zinc absorption this is why celiac child are often of short stature the romans would have become increasingly incapable of sensible planning and come to lack the stern old roman self control we know that a decrease birthrate of true bear roman eventually lead to the conscription of barbarian army and the opening up of roman citizenship today gluten and the antioxidant deficiency it cause is a major cause of infertility research have been do into the link between gluten sensitivity and hep c show a strong association especially after interferon therapy there is also a strong association between hep c and lymphoma a cancer of the lymph gland lymphoma is the characteristic cancer cause by gluten celiac have a 30x elevated risk of lymphoma to date no one seem to have test a strict gluten and dairy free diet for chronic hep c or post interferon toxicity but a great many people with hep c who take their health seriously have gone gluten free often without know of the link between the two condition but motivate by their own well being when avoiding gluten there is no nutritional need that can only be meet by grain nut and seed for example supply the same amino acid fat and vitamin in great concentration for example sunflower and sesame seed are superior source of methionine and vitamin e while legume are rich in complex carbohydrate gluten is also a cause of insulin resistance and everyone who develop liver fibrosis have some degree of insulin resistance gluten itself cause a four fold rise in insulin level unusual for a protein the cure for insulin resistance is two fold a high protein low carb diet the paleolithic diet is the most natural version of this diet and replacement of the nutrient deplete by gluten which are essential for the function of insulin receptor chromium magnesium and the antioxidant mineral and vitamin gluten also seem to cause amino acid deficiency include some of the very amino acid which wheat is suppose to supply methionine and cysteine gluten is very much an anti nutrient once one is sensitive to it recommend reading on gluten

the chemical additive we are tell in the food we eat that cause much of the problem perhaps I would like to suggest that the evidence from antiquity the pattern of the spread of agriculture in europe coincide with the pattern of civilizatory illnesse the level of sbhg associate with wheat consumption the high incidence of gliadin antibody among those with neurological illness of unknown origin the sensitivity to gluten among sibling of celiac in spite of the absence of genetic indicator associate with celiac disease and my own investigation of the literature regard lymphoma all point to the strong possibility that gluten is a dangerous substance to many more people than just celiac ron hoggan 1997 to which I might add the parallel association between gluten sensitivity and the various syndrome traditionally attribute to hcv infection all point to the even strong possibility that gluten is a very dangerous luxury for people with hepatitis c hcvpositive I find this on a myspace site

I start this whole mess in december 2002 I get sick with pneumonia end up in hospital with partial collapse lung both lung show pleural effusion and fluid in lung but leave 1 also show a spot on the lung I have broncioscope and other test run I continue to get pneumonia repeatedly and stay sick weak and short of breath I am still all of they that was what brung I to the lung biopsy and the v a t s procedure on may 28th a v a t s surgery I believe it stand for video assist thoracic surgery is where multiple incision are make mine was 3 and the surgeon use microscopic tool and camera that are insert through the incision to perform the operation that is need in my case it was a lung biopsy this procedure is do in place of a huge incision because the vat is suppose to be less invasive on the body therefor it is suppose to result in a fast recovery less pain for the patient small incision and less mutilation of the area and low chance for infection it is use in other operation like the gull bladder removal on the knee ect ect my incision are under my left before midday all are about 2 or 3 inch in length 2 of they was also use for placement of chest tubee to drain air and fluid from the chest cavity after the surgery so those seem to appear large I am not sure if they are my surgery take about 1 1 2 hour before the surgery start I have an epidural put in my back before I was put to sleep for the surgery the epidural was to control pain after the surgery was do I have a severe breathing attack and anxiety attack in the middle of put in the epidural I almost pass out they have to stop and give I oxygen till I could breath and was calm again then I was sedate with general anesthesia and take into surgery the surgeon collapse my left lung remove a large portion the surgeon say it was a preety large chunk of lung tissue from the bottom portion of my left lung the mass turn out to be nothing at all but the surgeon do find that my lung was diseased and the whole lung was involve he come out of the surgery and tell my family afterwards that it is very likly that the right lung would be the same way and that I probably would never breathe normal again he say it appear to be intertistial lung disease wich is a word for over 150 kind of lung disease but he tell the family they could narrow down there information search by look for restrictive pulmonary disease I definatly have pneumonitis wich is swell of the lung the surgeon want I to go to my pulmonolagist lung specialist for the final diagnosis in a couple of week when I wake up I could not believe the pain even with the epidural it was horrible I was being give morphine every 2 hour I have 2 chest tube come out the side of my chest they were hook to a noisy machine that constantly suction out air and fluid so the lung can re exspand but mine would not re exspand it stayed collapse because of a pneumothorax air leak and air pocket from the lung was at the top of the lung in my upper front chest wall they were debate to put in a third chest tube but decide that the leak was not go away but it have quit grow so they decide to wait and see if it would resolve itself wich it do 2 day after I go home I stay in icu over night then go to the surgery floor a high medical care than normal floor they remove the epidural in icu and that was when I really find out just how severe the pain would be I was then put on percocette and morphine every 2 hour around the clock I have never feel such pain in my life I think I might have extra nerve around my lung all I know is it hurt severly I have special machine on both leg that would automatically air up and put pressure on my leg to help prevent blood clot they constantly air up and deflate around the clock I have those on for 4 day till I was able to start to move around some when they remove those I have to wear support hose to also help prevent blood clot from travel to my lung I have the 2nd chest tube remove on june 10th the doc say I would probably get to leave that day but end up stay another 2 day cuz my oxygen was low I almost qualified for home oxygen you have to be at 50 on the blood gas level I was at 59 so breathing was still tough I never have an appetite the whole time there because the pain was just to severe to want to eat I was on 24 hour around the clock oxygen of course I have a cathader in for the 1st 9 day I just could not move or get out of bed at all the normal hospital stay for this procedure is 3 to 5 day I was in the hospital for 15 day because I have been on and off prednisone steroid to breath with for 5 monthe prior to the surgery and it slow down the ammune system in the body and make you heal slow than normal and you can not fight infection off very well so that is why I was there for so long the incision and air leak just would not heal I have a portable xray every single morning I was there I come home on june 12th with a blood gas level of 59 oxygen in the blood I am at 64 last we check I was able to pull off the last bandage last night the 16th and the incision is infect I go to the surgeon tomorrow any way for the fallow up so I decide to wait and let they check it then I am still in alot of pain and am get more short of breath than when I get out of the hospital so I think that I may have air in the chest again or fluid in the lung I will know tomorrow it have been rough but it was a neccessary surgery to find out what was wrong with my lung every body pain tolerance is different so what was painful to I could be a breeze for someone else if you are face this procedure do not let my story scare you out of have the surgery do I have been sick a while before the surgery so my lung were weak in the 1st place sorry this was so long someone on the board think I should tell about my experience for those who were also face this procedure I have ask about it from other on the board before the surgery and only get a few response thank you to those who respond I hope this help other to understand what a v a t s surgery is rise,negative,negative

another hospital my mother have never been alone between my father and I we stay overnight and keep her company and keep her spirit up her sister and my sister come and visit as well it have been tough but I can not imagine not being by mother side I feel like if the role was reverse she would be by my side my sister is unable to stay overnight because she have a family a son in elementary school I may be the young but I have step up it have been difficult for my dad and he s work full time to keep the house run I m single and 34 therefore I have rent my home and move back home with my parent for a while I have also take a leave of absence from work and I m not go back until my mother is home I feel like I can not stop type like this is a relief to get it all out it have been hard I m not one to express all of my emotion nor am I a crier I leave that to my sister when I do cry its usually when I m home alone or someplace private maybe this is the reason why I have 2 bald spot in my hair they are a smooth as a babys bottom I knownot goodbut its stress this have happen to I before about 7 year again where I was extremely stress my mom aml was consider not classify in addition her blood keep clot so they have have to keep her blood thinner heparin do not work and they have to try a different type hence the upcoming amputation due the multiple clot in her right leg all of her toe have die and dry gangrene have set in that was a very painful process for my mom and she require a pump for pain med the pain med along with the chemo she receive cause an illus in her stomach she have a nose tube put in for 2 week and that was finally remove she have have her first round of chemo 7 3 and on day 14 another bone marrow biopsy which unfortunately do not put the leukemia into remission apparently it do not even remotely kill the leukemia cell she was ask if she want to keep fighting or stop she choose to keep fighting and we tell she we would be by her side the entire time she was start or a more aggressive chemo which last for only 5 day and this round consist of 2 of the same drug but at a high potency and they add 2 other she was on idarubicin cytarabin fludarabine and another f drug that help produce new white blood cell this one was more of a hormone not a chemo drug and she was on this for a few more than 5 day due to the last drug they have to wait at least 30 day before they do another bone marrow biopsy or they would get a false positive tomorrow will be day 30 and she have finally recover from the chemo and all her count are back to normal therefore this friday they will do her amputation they will also have to clean out her original wound in her groin from the previous 3 surgery due to the chemo she do not completely heal and once she get her strength back and start walk with point her wound start to open and the staple start to separate from the wound they have been pack the wound to prevent it from any further infection this is painful but this pain do not last long like her toe pain she have in the beginning after she recover from surgery and they feel she is stable and they see no complication from surgery she will be move back to the oncology floor where they will do another bone marrow biopsy I just pray that this last aggressive round of chemo will put she into remission if not wellafter have this amputation and see the

hello all first time poster if thing go well hopefully last look for some info guidance on a worrisome finding here go 37 yr old male very physically active healthy diet moderate drinker all that good stuff however smoker vaper for about the past 20 year I smoke cigarette from 18 30 then transition to vape because like a lot of people at the time I think it would be a less harmful alternative when everybody start get sick from it this year I decide to see a doc and make sure I was all good I was not experience any specific symptom but he give I a chest x ray and take blood and urine sample nonetheless that was about a month ago the blood and urine sample show across the board good health however the chest x ray reveal what he describe as a small nodule on the middle left lung and he could not tell what it was so he order a ct scan I just have the ct scan today doc call back with a recommend follow up appointment to go over the result in a week as well as a recommend follow up ct scan in another 6 month I am try to interpret what all that could mean and the suspense is kill I I feel like the 6 month follow up ct scan might be encourage that make it sound like maybe monitor the thing is a good idea but arrange for immediate procedure is not yet necessary I am also choose to take my exceptionally good blood and urine result as an encouraging sign and for what it is worth the x ray tech also tell I I have huge lung which accord to he is for some reason apparently a good thing I have virtually none of the common symptom for lung cancer except that I have now been experience mild chest pain and discomfort in the exact area more or less that he tell I the nodule was discover and I am a bit concern this pain and discomfort could be a few thing first of all it start at the exact time I get the x ray result and I have a tendency toward mild hypochondria psychosomatic episode so it is entirely possible that upon hear potentially bad news my brain start make up symptom for a disease that is not there this chest pain discomfort is so mild it is also entirely possible that it was present before and I just never notice it until the doc give I incentive to start pay more attention a third possibility is that upon hear the result of the x ray I immediately give up vaping and have only cave in and smoke about 5 cigarette in the past month so perhaps I am just feel some side effect from not inhale garbage into my lung daily for the first time in 20 year a few other possibility could be that I am occasionally prone to heartburn gas problem and also as an active athletic type with an injury history I am somewhat prone to all sort of minor bodily ache and pain that I tend to usually ignore until give a reason not to ignore they or of course another possibility is that it is lung cancer I am just try to be realistic and consider all my option I have get a week of anxiety to deal with here while I wait for my follow up visit with my doctor to go over the ct result so here I am desperately hope for a reassuring opinion or two from a group of stranger familiar with this potential condition,negative,negative

I have bring up the subject of catabolic waste before but never really get anywhere with find out what I could do about it as I understand it catabolic wasting occur due to a low level of albumin which in normal people is produce by the liver catabolic waste or cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that is characterize by unintended and progressive weight loss weakness and low body fat and muscle at least 5 of body weight is lose cachexia is not cause by poor appetite and nutritional intake but rather by a metabolic state in which a breaking down rather than a building up occur in bodily tissue no matter how much nutritional intake occur additionally whether a patient receive nutrition orally or intravenously make no difference the patient simply can not gain weight so eat more is not an answer catabolic wasting is a symptom that diminish the quality of life worsen the underlying condition and is a major cause of death particularly with those suffer from cancer renal failure liver failure and aid unfortunately the cachectic state is all too apparent to any observer in severe chronic disease with the development of multiple organ failure some degree of malabsorption of nutrient probably contribute to the cachectic state the entire picture is reflect in a continue decline of the serum albumin as the illness progress the only cure I can find for this is transplant though some journal make reference to increase the level of vitamin e as a way of counter the lack of albumin currently I am lose 5lbs of body mass every month today I was down to 125lbs from 155 in december if the wasting continue I will be down to about 100lbs by christmas by which time I reckon other organ will also start fail probably the kidney first I do not forsee much of a future beyond the end of this year unless I can get it fix the question once more is do any one else suffer from this and also is there any way of at least stop its progress if not cure it _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ my gis response was to eat more protein but I reckon the protein that gets feed in the top come out the other end with no nutritional value extract from it I am see the transplant team next week but am get really desperate to get some answer before I see they any help advise would be so much appreciate craig aka worry from hotlanta,neutral,neutral

so when I was dxd with lyme in 2007 I think it was after go through every other test imaginable my doc convince my I have leukemia and so on my wbc was high month after month and they could not find a reason or source for it at it is high it was about 15 000 I go to the hospital last week about 4 am wednesday morning because my heart rate while lay in bed was 130 and I was getting very disorient I have grave disease hyperthyroid as well but have been medicate treat for over 5 year now now my thyroid is high than it was in the beginning of my symptom and I am being super medicated for my heart and thyroid leave I zombifie right now it all the blood work they are many abnormality high platelet high glucose low iron and very high white blood count at 21 000 the first doctor on staff was so concerned he want to admit I think I have some horrible infection 3 day later and massive amount of blood culture take they find nothing normally I know well than to bring up lyme because that gets knock down quickly but I mention it as it is an infection that can cause many of my symptom and blood work they would not even do a lyme test at my request that was pretty stupid if you ask I I think maybe that if I get dxd again with lyme the stupid doctor that they are would automatically treat I as a new case new tick and maybe my insurance would pay for the iv treatment again hey I can dream right I am just stuck and do not know what to do there is no help if you can not afford it because insurance company rule the world or at least america obviously my body is scream that something is wrong no one will listen or try to help I got discharge with amoxicillin because they recognize that something have to be wrong somewhere whatever it is my new attitude about everything whatever it is just too frustrating to deal with anymore sorry just have to vent it out,negative,negative

I am sure all of we remember a point in time when we as kid think nothing could hurt bad than a stubbed toe since then as we have get more and more damage our definition of the bad pain ever have change and change again this is why I think the doctor ask I what my pain level is on a scale of 1 to 10 is so useless what someone else find a 9 like get a tattoo I might not even notice what I consider a good day at a 4 might be someone else 10 or even bad their 4 might by my 10 when I was work as a nurse a zillion year ago a teenage kid come into the office in a wheelchair two week early he was the captain of the basketball team the doctor demand he be on the table to be check out so as carefully as I could I pick he up and put he on the table and he scream for five minute this was repeat when I put he back in the wheelchair that always strike I as what a 10 look like the good news is that the doctor I work for find the correct diagnosis of leukemia and within a month he was out play basketball again but I will never forget that 15 year old kid so where was I go with all of this level of pain we can all understand an immediate ouch of hit our hand against something most of we are hip on the dull ache of old injury or arthritis of of arthritis bring about by old injury that pain that is always there but that we can still say that this spot hurt and this area ache and this spot hurt most of all but after that come where the pain area start to blend together instead of my know hurt my whole leg hurt or I do not know where the pain is originate but this whole area of my body is kill I then there is what I call a fine line and hubby call a shelf where the amount of pain exceed the brain ability to process it anymore at which point everything hurt more of less equally high brain function are overwrite as the brain use all synapsis to try to process pain everything below that point can usually be treat more effectively with pain med or otc method massage aleve ten unit and so on once the brain can do nothing but rattle around with the pain impulse it is hard to get back under the line that shelf to where something can be do to fix it I have find that there is actually one more level in pain it is one I try to avoid at all cost it is where the brain just stop accept pain input a blockade go up and pain sense are not feel anymore a numbness fill the place I know should be scream I can feel nothing but I get cognitive function back but I pay for any activity I do while numb when I go back to pain,positive,positive

38 am there is a lot of info in this one but I think it was a very good article and want to share with you many people are help by chemo and radiation and this is not mean to downplay the benefit from they if dietary and lifestyle change can help prevent the multilication of cancer cell easy medication for I to swallow johns hopkins update this is an extremely good article everyone should read it after year of tell people chemotherapy is the only way to try try being the key word to eliminate cancer johns hopkins is finally start to tell you there is an alternative way cancer update from johns hopkins 1 every person have cancer cell in the body these cancer cell do not show up in the standard test until they have multiply to a few billion when doctor tell cancer patient that there are no more cancer cell in their body after treatment it just mean the test are unable to detect the cancer cell because they have not reach the detectable size 2 cancer cell occur between 6 to more than 10 time in a person lifetime 3 when the person immune system is strong the cancer cell will be destroy and prevent from multiply and form tumor 4 when a person have cancer it indicate the person have nutritional deficiency these could be due to genetic but also to environmental food and lifestyle factor 5 to overcome the multiple nutritional deficiency change diet to eat more adequately and healthy 4 5 time day and by include supplement will strengthen the immune system 6 chemotherapy involve poison the rapidly grow cancer cell and also destroy rapidly grow healthy cell in the bone marrow gastrointestinal tract and so on and can cause organ damage like liver kidney heart lung and so on 7 radiation while destroy cancer cell also burn scar and damage healthy cell tissue and organ 8 initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size however prolong use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction 9 when the body have too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromise or destroy hence the person can succumb to various kind of infection and complication 10 chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cell to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy surgery can also cause cancer cell to spread to other site 11 an effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cell by not feed it with the food it need to multiply cancer cell feed on a sugar substitute like nutrasweet equal spoonful and so on are make with aspartame and it is harmful a well natural substitute would be manuka honey or molasse but only in very small amount table salt have a chemical add to make it white in color well alternative is braggs aminos or sea salt b milk cause the body to produce mucus especially in the gastro intestinal tract cancer feed on mucus by cut off milk and substitute with unsweetened soy milk cancer cell are being starve c cancer cell thrive in an acid environment a meat base diet is acidic and it is good to eat fish and a little other meat like chicken meat also contain livestock antibiotic growth hormone and parasite which are all harmful especially to people with cancer d a diet make of 80 fresh vegetable and juice whole grain seed nuts and a little fruit help put the body into an alkaline environment about 20 can be from cook food include bean fresh vegetable juice provide live enzyme that are easily absorb and reach down to cellular level within 15 minute to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cell to obtain live enzyme for build healthy cell try and drink fresh vegetable juice most vegetable include be an sprout and eat some raw vegetable 2 or 3 time a day enzyme are destroy at temperature of 104 degree f 40 degree c e avoid coffee tea and chocolate which have high caffeine green tea is a well alternative and have cancer fighting property water well to drink purified water or filter to avoid know toxin and heavy metal in tap water distil water is acidic avoid it 12 meat protein is difficult to digest and require a lot of digestive enzyme undigested meat remain in the intestine become putrefied and lead to more toxic buildup 13 cancer cell wall have a tough protein cover by refrain from or eat less meat it free more enzyme to attack the protein wall of cancer cell and allow the bodys killer cell to destroy the cancer cell 14 some supplement build up the immune system ip6 flor ssence essiac anti oxidant vitamin mineral efas and so on to enable the body own killer cell to destroy cancer cell other supplement like vitamin e are know to cause apoptosis or program cell death the bodys normal method of dispose of damage unwanted or unneeded cell 15 cancer is a disease of the mind body and spirit a proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor anger un forgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit learn to relax and enjoy life 16 cancer cell can not thrive in an oxygenate environment exercise daily and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level oxygen therapy is another mean employ to destroy cancer cell 1 no plastic container in micro 2 no water bottle in freezer 3 no plastic wrap in microwave johns hopkins have recently send this out in its newsletter this information is being circulate at walter reed army medical center as well dioxin chemical cause cancer especially breast cancer dioxin are highly poisonous to the cell of our body do not freeze your plastic bottle with water in they as this release dioxin from the plastic recently dr edward fujimoto wellness program manager at castle hospital was on a tv program to explain this health hazard he talk about dioxin and how bad they are for we he say that we should not be heat our food in the microwave use plastic container this especially apply to food that contain fat he say that the combination of fat high heat and plastic release dioxin into the food and ultimately into the cell of the body instead he recommend use glass such as corn ware pyrex or ceramic container for heating food you get the same result only without the dioxin so such thing as tv dinner instant raman and soup and so on should be remove from the container and heat in something else paper is not bad but you do not know what is in the paper it is just safe to use temper glass corning ware and so on he remind we that a while ago some of the fast food restaurant move away from the foam container to paper the dioxin problem is one of the reason please share this with your whole email list also he point out that plastic wrap such as saran is just as dangerous when place over food to be cook in the microwave as the food is nuke the high heat cause poisonous toxin to actually melt out of the plastic wrap and drip into the food cover food with a paper towel instead this is an article that should be send to anyone important in your life lesa anytime you encounter an article that is this important please share it with we here at over the fence as I have do here and with any of your own friend

liver biopsy indicate persistent inflammation and fibrosis in hcv antibody positive people with undetectable hcv rna december 2008 people who carry antibody indicate exposure to hepatitis c virus hcv but who have undetectable plasma hcv viral load are generally consider to have inactive disease likewise continue undetectable plasma hcv rna 24 month after completion of interferon base therapy is usually regard as a cure but hide hcv in the liver even in the absence of detectable virus in the blood may still lead to liver disease progression accord to a study publish in the december 2008 issue of hepatology it is unclear whether hcv have been eradicate or persist at a low level in hcv antibody positive hcv rna negative individual the study author note as background and the natural history of the disease and liver histology in such individual are not well characterize matthew hoare and colleague from the you k study 172 hcv antibody positive but plasma hcv rna negative individual who

indistinguishable from patient with detectable plasma hcv rna lobular cd4 staining was absent in control subject but present in patient with both undetectable and detectable plasma hcv rna more mark in the latter non viremic hcv antibody positive patient have a liver biopsy that is usually abnormal the study author conclude fibrosis was present in most with similar inflammatory infiltrate to viremic case the add that the presence of a cd8 rich inflammatory infiltrate suggest an ongoing immune response in the liver support the view that hcv may persist in the liver in the majority of hcv

the virus liver damage continue 10 dec 2008 treat patient who have chronic hepatitis c and advanced liver disease with long term pegylate interferon significantly decrease their liver enzyme viral level and liver inflammation but the treatment do not slow or prevent the progression of serious liver disease a study find these finding come from the clinical trial hepatitis c antiviral long term treatment against cirrhosis halt c and are report in the dec 4 issue of the new england journal of medicine halt c was fund by the national institutes of health nih with additional support from hoffmann la roche inc the result from halt c show without question that maintenance therapy with peginterferon do not prevent progression of liver disease among patient who have fail prior treatment say james everhart m d project scientist for halt c in the division of digestive disease and nutrition national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney disease niddk the principal sponsor of halt c at nih these finding heighten the incentive to develop more effective drug for patient with severe liver disease due to hepatitis c peginterferon therapy for up to 48 week is standard for chronic hepatitis c but patient who do not have a sustain response to initial therapy have been give the drug over a long time base on study show that this approach suppress viral and enzyme level even if the virus is not completely eliminate however it was not know if long term therapy would improve important clinical outcome such as liver damage and death halt c a randomized multicenter trial of 1 050 patient with chronic hepatitis c who have fail prior treatment to eradicate the infection test whether long term treatment with peginterferon alfa 2a would reduce the development of cirrhosis liver cancer or liver failure the 517 patient randomize to the treatment before midday receive 90 microgram of peginterferon in weekly injection for 3 5 year the 533 patient in the control before midday undergo the same follow up and care as the treat patient include liver biopsy quarterly clinic visit and blood test all patient have advanced liver fibrosis a gradual scarring of the liver that put patient at risk for progressive liver disease and liver failure the outcome study in halt c were death liver cancer or liver failure and for those who do not have cirrhosis initially the development of cirrhosis at the end of the study 34 1 percent of the treat group and 33 8 percent of the control group have experience at least one outcome patient in the treat group have significantly low blood level of the hepatitis c virus and improvement in liver inflammation however there was no major difference in rate of any of the primary outcome between the group among treat patient 17 percent stop peginterferon after 18 month and 30 percent stop the drug after two year infection musculoskeletal or digestive problem were the most common reason for stop the drug accord to halt c study chair and principal investigator adrian m di bisceglie m d professor of internal medicine at saint louis university school of medicine in missouri look into how maintenance therapy work in non responder is an important step patient should not receive interferon as maintenance therapy for chronic hepatitis c however we can build on what was learn in halt c to identify well treatment that may delay or prevent liver damage in patient with advanced disease he say article adapt by medical news today from original press release the hepatitis c virus infect more than 100 million person worldwide and as many as 4 million in the united states hepatitis c rank with alcohol abuse as the most common cause of chronic liver disease and lead to about 1 000 liver transplant in the united

I have read a lot of discussion about smoking being a factor for develop lung cancer and also not being one and their thought towards it I agree that smoking for the most part is not the wise of idea if your wanting to lead a healthy life I do not agree with the fact that it cause it since I know too many people that have smoke many year and never develop lung cancer I believe that it is cause from a breakdown in the immune system where essential vitamin are lose or need and of course gene that are pass down to we it seem by now that they could detect these gene and also give something to people especially over the age of 50 to strengthen the immune system and make good cell strong to fight the bad cell that spread cancer my mom do develop lung cancer and do smoke so she do fall under that stereotype of lung cancer but there are very many that never have without cigarette my mom would of been miserable in her later day because that is all she have since she was a widow by 7 year when she past away and they comfort she and relax she and she enjoy it very much by the way she have degenerative bone disease since her early twenty and have always suffer with bone pain for many year she also become diabetic in her 50 so I have to think that just possibly the cancer come from some of those factor since I see a lot of people have diabete and then cancer I have read an article about cancer and it state that cancer cell love sugar so you should really watch your sugar intake I am glad my mom have her cigarette because they were like a good friend to she and she would of been miserable without in her final month so I do not blame she for that at all or the cigarette as I mention too many people who do not smoke or drink develop cancer as my mother in law even do and die at the age of 53 like her father who do not smoke and it was determined that it was an aggressive genetic cancer now we have to worry about my husband and our child whom it would not matter what they do because his mom eat very healthy and do not have bad habit I guess my message is that you should do what make you happy and try to limit some of the bad of course but just be comfortable in what you are do because life can be too short to do without and my mom die do what she love and I would not have it any other way and good for she we love you mom I think you should just do what ever make you feel good because in the end it would not matter because what go to happen will happen and that is that it is aggravating but I really am start to believe 100 in that I also do not like the way people who develop lung cancer are treat by some and especially doctor do not blame yourself for this disease just because it is call lung cancer my heart go out to all of you suffer with this disease good luck and good wish for success,positive,positive

hi everybody I just want to say that accord to scientific research more then half of people who have hep c never develop liver cirrhosis or cancer of cause if you have a certain life style like no drinking or smoke healthy diet and if you do not have other health problem they say if you make it to 60 with hep c most likely you will die from something else it do not apply to everyone though again of cause it is well to get rid off it and start treatment no doubt but I think we scare all these young people on this site let we be more positive and optimistic especially because we can see clearly on this site that it have more success story then the other way around as I say million of people live with it happily cause they do not know they have it and only 1 5 develop cirrhosis or liver canceragain hip c is not sickness it just a condition in which the patient might develop cirrhosis or liver cancer I wish everybody to believe in yourself and believe in new triple medicine and new light med is come out soon hep c is treatable now we live in a different world cheer up,positive,positive

first of all let I say that no two people are alike and that your result may differ from mine with that say I would like to detail my recent colonoscopy in hope that it may enlighten those who have yet to have one and those who may have have one a while back and thing are always change I have my first colonoscopy 10 year ago the prep at that time was drink over one gallon of liquid over a period of time I do remember drink start at 12 00 after midday and again at 6 00 after midday of the same day it was lot of liquid and it taste terrible fast forward to april of 2017 this time the prep I use was call suprep you mix a six ounce bottle of liquid crud with water equal 16 oz drink it down and then follow with 32 oz of water I take this at 6 00 after midday the evening before my colonoscopy and then repeat the same thing at 5 00 before midday the day of my colonoscopy the way my gastro doctor have I prep was no fiber diet two day prior and then only liquid the day before a tip to drinking and something I read which was helpful is have the liquid cold and drink it through a straw I also mix a little crystal light with the solution to take the medicinal taste away I also sip the mixture while hold my breath and then take a drink of propel water to minimize the bad taste it was a mix between sweet and savory but definitely not unbearable after take the first dose at 6 00 after midday I have one fairly large bowel movement about one hour later and then nothing else that evening I think this isn t bad at all well then come 5 00 before midday the next morning when you have to repeat everything over this time I finish the mixture at around 5 30 and even before finish the 32 oz of water bang wow I was clean out in a few hour and everything come out like a waterfall you know you have do a good job when whatever wind up come out at the end is clear I have to leave for my 8 00 before midday appointment at 7 30 before midday not really know if I was go to have to go again I would suggest maybe wear an adult diaper to the doctor s office in case you need to go on the way I didn t have one so I wrap a towel in my undie just in case I didn t go in the car but need to dash to the restroom 2 3 time prior to the colonoscopy now the colonoscopy is start you can t drink anything at all two hour prior to the procedure but you have been go to the bathroom a lot and when they attempt to put in the iv they have a really hard time because I was dehydrate no duh there isn t much you can do about this they eventually find a vein somewhere on my right side but the doctor was talk to I try to distract I and I think it was finally put in my hand colonoscopy is do with the light anesthesia give you don t and shouldn t remember much if anything about the whole process I love that part you then recover and my doctor say to resume a regular diet as soon as I feel like it I have one bowel movement the evening of and see blood in my stool and on the toilet paper I call after hour and they say to watch it and let they know if it didn t go away the next day well the next day today I have another bowel movement and everything come out good I am hope to be out of the wood at this point I have have discomfort in my intestine pass gas and feel somewhat nauseous I take some gas pill for this and they really help I have three diminutive small polyp that were remove and send to pathology I am cross my finger to receive a good report back after this the doctor will give recommendation on when to repeat the colonoscopy not a lot of fun but necessary if you are 50 and above I would rather go through this than not and find out too late that I have colon cancer hope this have been helpful,positive,positive

detect by pcr or western blot to perform this test we ask 3x 8 ml whole blood in na heparin tube 1x 2ml yellow cap tube and 2x 2ml whole blood in edta tube specimen must be receive within 48 hour at room temperature cost of this test is 340 this price include the co culture and a screen for other mlv relate virus by direct pcr on whole blood serology red laboratory have make an agreement with vipdx reno nevada to offer serology testing sample will be collect in our laboratory and send to vipdx for analysis to perform this test we ask 1x serum separator tube yellow cap cost of this test is 219 this price include first processing of sample serum separation store shipping to the usa and reporting of result detection of mlv related virus by pcr and sequence this test is base on the publication by lo et al who report the detection of mlv relate sequence in the blood of cfs patient to perform this test we ask 1x 2ml whole blood in edta tube purple cap cost of this test is 108 note that it is include in the co culture test so you do not have to order mlv screen if you already request co culture we have the capacity to sequence the pcr product however this is currently perform only for internal use quality control research project we may start routine sequence in the future if it appear that distinguish the different virus variant is clinically important interpretation of result advantage and limitation of each of these test must be fully understand before draw any conclusion in any case interpretation must be do by a physician co culture is very sensitive and most importantly is the only test that can distinguish active infection from latent one one limitation is the fact that it is perform from blood cell it may therefore not be able to detect a virus which is present in another part of the body gut spleen also the co culture procedure have been develop and validate for xmrv it use a specific target cell sensitive to xmrv infection although it is likely that most virus variant are able to infect this target cell line this have not yet been demonstrate therefore there is a possibility that certain virus like mlvs can not be detect by this technique serology will be able to detect antibody even when the virus is localize in another tissue than blood it is probably able to detect most variant of xmrv and mlv related virus a major limitation of serology however is that it do not give any indication regard the stage of infection it may also give false negative result in the case of patient with a deficient immune system which are unable to make adequate antibody in the future the lack of specificity may also be an issue if it turn out that variant identification is important for clinical evaluation mlv pcr on whole blood can give very precious information when follow by sequence since it allow very precise variant identification a quantitative pcr test is in development in order to measure viral titer and not only presence of the virus pcr can be perform on any type of tissue include biopsy saliva csf a combination of different approach is probably the good way to test for xmrv and or mlv relate virus a well understanding of xmrv mlv biology is necessary before we can evaluate with certainty the sensitivity specificity and clinical relevance of the different approach use to detect these virus get a negative result do not definitely mean that you are not infect you may be infect with a specific variant not detect by any of these approach or the viral titer may be too low at the time of testing red laboratory do not make any claim regard the biological significance and medical implication of a positive result only physician can do test interpretation define treatment option and answer question regard transmissibility and health implication cheer al,neutral,neutral

first of all let I say that no two people are alike and that your result may differ from mine with that say I would like to detail my recent colonoscopy in hope that it may enlighten those who have yet to have one and those who may have have one a while back and thing are always change I have my first colonoscopy 10 year ago the prep at that time was drink over one gallon of liquid over a period of time I do remember drink start at 12 00 after midday and again at 6 00 after midday of the same day it was lot of liquid and it taste terrible fast forward to april of 2017 this time the prep I use was call suprep you mix a six ounce bottle of liquid crud with water equal 16 oz drink it down and then follow with 32 oz of water I take this at 6 00 after midday the evening before my colonoscopy and then repeat the same thing at 5 00 before midday the day of my colonoscopy the way my gastro doctor have I prep was no fiber diet two day prior and then only liquid the day before a tip to drinking and something I read which was helpful is have the liquid cold and drink it through a straw I also mix a little crystal light with the solution to take the medicinal taste away I also sip the mixture while hold my breath and then take a drink of propel water to minimize the bad taste it was a mix between sweet and savory but definitely not unbearable after take the first dose at 6 00 after midday I have one fairly large bowel movement about one hour later and then nothing else that evening I think this isn t bad at all well then come 5 00 before midday the next morning when you have to repeat everything over this time I finish the mixture at around 5 30 and even before finish the 32 oz of water bang wow I was clean out in a few hour and everything come out like a waterfall you know you have do a good job when whatever wind up come out at the end is clear I have to leave for my 8 00 before midday appointment at 7 30 before midday not really know if I was go to have to go again I would suggest maybe wear an adult diaper to the doctor s office in case you need to go on the way I didn t have one so I wrap a towel in my undie just in case I didn t go in the car but need to dash to the restroom 2 3 time prior to the colonoscopy now the colonoscopy is start you can t drink anything at all two hour prior to the procedure but you have been go to the bathroom a lot and when they attempt to put in the iv they have a really hard time because I was dehydrate no duh there isn t much you can do about this they eventually find a vein somewhere on my right side but the doctor was talk to I try to distract I and I think it was finally put in my hand colonoscopy is do with the light anesthesia give you don t and shouldn t remember much if anything about the whole process I love that part you then recover and my doctor say to resume a regular diet as soon as I feel like it I have one bowel movement the evening of and see blood in my stool and on the toilet paper I call after hour and they say to watch it and let they know if it didn t go away the next day well the next day today I have another bowel movement and everything come out good I am hope to be out of the wood at this point I have have discomfort in my intestine pass gas and feel somewhat nauseous I take some gas pill for this and they really help I have three diminutive small polyp that were remove and send to pathology I am cross my finger to receive a good report back after this the doctor will give recommendation on when to repeat the colonoscopy not a lot of fun but necessary if you are 50 and above I would rather go through this than not and find out too late that I have colon cancer hope this have been helpful,positive,positive

a battle worth fight the heavy old wooden front door of the old brick ranch house groan as it was violently fling open I immediately feel the sticky hot humid outside air hit as soon as I put one foot outside the door the sun was just begin to set create a sky dust with blue and pink beauty in the midst of pain I gasp at the outside air I was become to feel trap inside of the crowd house and have to get out one unsure footstep at a time I make my way down the black asphalt semi circle front driveway dodge the prickly gumball speckle the way a centerpiece of the front yard the giant old sweet gum tree never fail at leave massive amount of gumball everywhere the burn asphalt scorch my bare foot with each step make yet too much was go on in my head to notice the burning feel the far away I walk from my lifelong house the less control I have over my direction at the end of the driveway a jolt come across my whole body and my leg swing into a sprint lead the way down the hilly street my long dirty blonde hair whip against my back as I fly down from the top of the hill clutch at my rhinestone cover flip phone in one hand a last lifeline to reality one I was not yet ready to utilize my leg keep on move like wheel on a bike and at the end of the road I take a sharp turn I stealthily make my way across a neighbor lawn sprint through thick green grass still wet from the sprinkler eventually I make my way onto a run trail and slow down a bit heart still pump at a swift rate in my chest tall ancient oak tree line the trail provide a sense of escape from the outside world a seemingly never end pale concrete path weave through the tree create a winding trail I could not help but feel the urge to follow the shady patch was a familiar peaceful place that I love to go bike riding along as a child no one else was around and the only sound were that of the neighborhood street nearby and hidden bird chirp in the tree I wish I could just stay there for forever leave the awful unfold reality behind I was do what I feel the most comfortable to do and what I have been do throughout the past year run away from my problem my leg come to a slow walk as I gasp for air try my good to block any thought out of my head I wonder how long I could stay go without anyone in the house noticing I look down at the phone in my hand and take a deep breath punch the number into the light key I begin to shake and know there was no turn back now the second the word come out of my mouth I know there was no more pretend thing were okay and it was official I could no long fake that my family was perfectly normal the game of make believe was do as the voice on the other end answer I open my mouth and in a scared shaky voice declare its over it can be seemly hard to realize exactly how many advancement have been make in medicine over the year until you compare the past to the present a recent phone conversation with my 90 year old grandfather put modern cancer medicine into perspective for I ben bronson was only 15 year old back in 1935 when his old sister fall ill the doctor at the time were only able to diagnosis his sister with suffer from a tumor in her colon this diagnosis at the time was ultimately write off as a fatal one with no treatment in sight what the doctor were not aware of at the time though was anything about what exactly cancer was or way to treat cancer research and technology have not come that far yet and those suffer from what today is now know as cancer have little to no chance of survival today what his sister ultimately lose her life over would be consider colon cancer and while now there are treatment option a complete cure is still yet to be reach in may 1940 time magazine report that since 1900 over 3 and a half million people in the you s have suffer from cancer and most of the people suffer ultimately die from the disease divide 3 and half million by the 40 year there was an average of 87 500 people suffer from cancer each year the time magazine article go on to call cancer the great of all hazard of live and it will probably always remain in this position of importance and may even become much more prominent as a cause of death while in 1940 87 500 people suffer from cancer each year seem a surmountable number today in 2010 newsweek sharon begley report that cancer is project to kill 569 400 this year alone these number are basically state that even with large leap in medical advancement more people then ever are die from the disease statistic like these can be entirely disparage and leave lot of question one of the question I know I continue to ask myself to this day is where do all the money go that is give to fund cancer research and why are all of these fund not produce significant result and lower the number of people suffer while these number project that cancer is in a bad position then it was back in 1940 there is still hope on the horizon normal sixteen year old do not really have any significant worry in their life and nothing too press that is on their mind average sixteen year old are count down the day eager to get their driver license and cringe in jealously every time a friend is able to get their license before they they yearn to be with their friend every second of the day and frown at the idea of have to spend time with their family family time become unimportant in the eye of a teenager something they are only willing to do when force the most important thing in the eye of a sixteen year old are being like and try new thing life have not yet become serious in the eye of a sixteen year old and there are few real worry year sixteen was different for I though it was the year I was deal a hard hand in the game of life and through force learn the importance of family I experience great disappointment in modern medicine and learn first hand how short life can really be a giant earthquake in the middle of an unsuspecting town it was harsh and it change everything sun pour through the large full length window fill the room with the warmth that can only come from a mid west summer the brick ranch house was quiet and the bird chirp on the bird feeder outside the window could be clearly hear a large oak tree sway in the wind on the patio and the orange tabby cat lay by the full length window memorize by the bird it was the end of summer and I was leave grasp at the stand lay on the giant sectional family room couch I make an effort to change the channel as soon as a back to school commercial come on I hate being home the house and my family was painfully boring and all I could think about was how great it would be once I get my license and could go where ever I want when ever I want to the phone begin to ring yet I ignore it my friend never call the home phone and so to I there was no point in bother to answer it suddenly screams disrupt the sleepy house pierce cry of distress that make my ear ache and my stomach twist I jolt out of my lazy relaxed state on the couch and zone in the source of the noise enter in the kitchen I come upon my mother sit at the kitchen table red face and teary eye so this is pretty much a death sentence she yell into the white cordless phone head hold low and leg shake she looked scarily defeat the anger in her voice send chill through my body immediately my mind shoot back to a few day ago I was lie in her bed and she stand in front of a wall mirror complaining of stomach pain she tell I she have a bad feeling about it and was go to the doctor soon to get it check out I do not have to listen to anything else she was scream into the phone I know what was go on cringe as my stomach begin to turn I feel freeze in that moment finally I was able to move and slowly back out of the kitchen I have a sense that it was good just to give my mother some space at the time I rush to my room and close the door stay out of the way seem to be the good thing to do in the beginning of the summer of 2001 my mother have survive cancer without even know it until the very end the doctor swear the constant stomach pain she suffer from were just constipation and nothing serious to worry about even after persistent visit to the doctor office they swear it could be nothing terrible after all she was only 42 and people that age rarely get cancer they reason quickly the pain become unbearable though and a late night rush to the emergency room prove the doctor diagnosis to be terribly wrong the stomach pain that have start out dull and rise to an intense stabbing pain was not something trivial such as constipation but in fact colon cancer and my mother was on the verge of death an emergency surgery to remove a tumor in my mother colon and the luck of get one of the good surgeon in the midwest save her life the news shock all the doctor who would have never guess the stomach pain was in fact cancer the doctor go on to promise that they get all of the cancer out in surgery and chemotherapy was not even truly necessary my mother though want to make sure and opt to go through month of painful chemotherapy just in case the just in case month of endured chemotherapy prove to not be enough though and the disease make its way back to my mother body in 2004 there at the kitchen table my mother sit take in the awful news this time was much bad though and the news was not only bad but also extremely grim not only have the colon cancer come back to invade her body but it have also metastasize into her liver the national cancer institute explain that metastasis is when cancer cell spread from one part of the body to another form a new tumor in a different organ while metastatic cancer do not always have symptom my mother become to experience pain in her stomach and just have a gut feeling that something was wrong inside the feeling lead she to the doctor and soon the doctor become the bearer of bad news the mid afternoon call from the oncologist reaffirm not only my mother deepest fear but my whole family with the diagnosis of more cancer come another full on battle only this time hope was outnumber with painful reality one by one the troop came rush in for battle as I stay on the sideline watch the reality that set my mother into scream that summer day was that liver cancer have a low survival rate to begin with and metastatic liver cancer have an even low survival rate accord to cancersurvivalrate com the overall worldwide survival rate for liver cancer is 7 five year after initial diagnosis the diagnosis give to my mother was even more grim though and even with treatment the doctor predict she would not survive any long than a year my mother was a fighter though and after swallow a hard pill of bone shake news she gear up for the fierce battle ahead even know how painful go through chemo was she was willing to go through it again I hear tale of the burn feeling that hit as soon as the chemo make its way into your vein and just see my mother agree to go through such a thing without much hope was awe inspire the month that follow the terrible news turn chilly and dark quick then I could have ever imagine winter come in full force storm rumble the door and rattle the hall round and round of chemotherapy slowly begin to suck the life out of my mother weakness strike as hard as expect and soon even simple thing such as get up to get a glass of water become difficult home time become an exhausting time balance take care of myself with help my mother out medcinenet com state that the side effect from chemotherapy include fatigue pain nausea and vomit along with a whole list of effect on other part of the body while my mother suffer all of these side effect to the full the one noticeable common side effect people normally associate chemo with she never suffer from this side effect is most noticeable due to its affect outward appearance and is hair loss even after continual chemotherapy my mother thick long blonde hair was stubborn and refuse to come out chemocare com report that hair loss do not occur with all chemotherapy and that chemotherapy affect each person differently this fact make it seem from an outsider point of view that she was not very sick at all no hair loss also make it easy for I to hide from my friend the truth I do not want any sympathy or for my family to appear as thought it was not normal or that it was fall apart it may seem strange to some but even pretend there was an ounce of normalcy leave was well then let the truth hang out after several week of chemo the result were back on the effectiveness of the treatment and the news was nothing but sicken my whole family have hope and pray for the good but it was just not enough not only have the chemo fail to shrink my mother tumor in her liver but the cancer have start to spread through out her body before I know it family from out of town begin show up at our door and our house was under invasion from the unfamiliar everywhere I look was some relative try to help clean house or cook dinner my grandmother was suddenly live with we sit at the kitchen table to greet I everyday after I come home for school thing go back to normal seem nothing more then a fantasy to I and I wish hard that the fantasy could come true I hate the intruder and my solution was to spend as much time as possible away from home I want my family to be normal again and I want all the people crowd out every corner to leave the sicker my mother become the more faith I lose in the doctor and modern medicine I could not understand how the doctor were not able to get her disease under control and how they were fail at the fight every new trial drug bring new hope hope that was quickly destroy by reality all the medicine continue fail at the fight and turn into disappointment after disappointment it become almost impossible to pretend like nothing was wrong anymore even trial treatment seem to fail to work and soon the cancer have spread to the bottom of her lung at the time I just could not understand how none of the treatment work in combat the cancer and become angry in a way the new york times recently run an article by gina kolata that say 105 billion have been spend on the fight against cancer since 1971 when richard nixon officially declare war on the disease even with all the money spend on research though the disease have continue to keep a steady death rate with only a small drop in number over the year one reason the article state that the battle against cancer have not make much progress is because the grant system use to fund cancer research have become a job program and less of a way to actually make ground break discovery research laboratory lean towards play it safe and spend their time work on small project which are unlikely to lead to a cure for cancer project that could possibly make a difference in cancer treatment or progress towards a cure for cancer are often rule out because of the uncertainty that follow they hear news like this is not only incredibly dishearten but also painful to hear that not everything is being do that could be do to combat cancer patient are suffer family are suffer and society as a whole is ache for a major cancer advancement as a last hope my mother was give incredibly strong chemo and my whole family cross their finger not until this point do my mother truly start to look sick and fragile her full head of hair finally give out and slowly but surely start to fall out she try to cope with the hair loss but it was evident she was becoming defeat her thick blonde hair was her trademark and an asset she gain compliment through her entire life unable to stand up against the harsh drug her hair leave and scarf were a measly replacement weakness spread throughout her body and soon even eat become a hard task quickly weight begin to drop off she it was at a shocking rate and incredibly hard to watch before I know it everyday become a struggle to try and get my mother to eat more it come to the point that I would sit next to she in bed beg she just to take another bite of food think that just maybe it would help my father would be send on trip all across town get her favorite food pain tear throughout my mother body and she become so thin that you could actually see the tumor in her liver protrude out from her stomach it was a ghastly site to see and at time it almost feel as though I was look at the living dead while it would have make sense to want to spend as much time as possible home with my mother I ache to be out with my friend spend the night over at friend house entire weekend I spend more time then ever away from home relish the fact that I have my license and was able to get away whenever it feel strange in a way that finally when I was able to drive my mother was no long able to the cancer drug were impair and not safe to drive while take there I was take over her car and every once in a while I feel that I was take over a role that I was much to young to handle my two brother and I were sit down at the breakfast room at the white table it seem eerily formal and force I look out the large bay window at the road and refuse to acknowledge anything around I I do not want to hear what the strange lady sit across from we have to say I want to get up and leave I do not need some stranger tell I what was go on in my life I could feel it and see it with my own eye my parent think by not tell I everything it would be well but they do not have to because I already know I become a master at eavesdropping and everything they hesitate to tell I find out on my own the lady sit across from I at the table that day was from hospice hospicenet org explain that hospice emphasize palliative rather than curative treatment quality rather than quantity of life hospice come in when someone have a limited life expectancy to aide the person in pain control and comfort as a sixteen year old though I do not see any positive all I see was that my mom was give up on the fight at that moment my heart break and I suffer through the pain listen to this person explain their presence I want they out I want they to stop read this children book to I about a young child parent die from cancer in their home and to let I get about my day I could not comprehend how she could just give up how could she not fight until the very end instead of leave the people multiply in strong force like a virus you just can not shake I spend my time try my good to ignore their existence and when that was not possible I just stay away from home in my mind I know I should be spend time with my mother while I could but my heart could not bear to be inside the house with the many invader there was hospice care giver there was nurse there was ivs and I could not bear to be around any of it my faith in medicine was go and I could not believe that in modern day there truly was no cure everyone was just sit around wait for the last breath to be take in the last two month of my mother life she begin to wither away look more skeletal and less like my mother she was slowly slip away in front of my eye and there was nothing I could do to stop it at time she would say thing do not make any sense at all and I was terrify I want to freeze time and then rewind to back when my family was normal and she was healthy she was on a constant morphine drip and nurse were always at the house life become full of medical supply and pill bottle galore yet everyday she get bad and bad it was painfully hard to watch and I make the decision to leave for the summer once again the cold weather have pass and life come back to the plant and I could not bear to stay in my house with the intruder any long so away I go off to the country ranch like I do every summer only this time it was more run away then enjoy summer break at the ranch life seem normal once again and just what I need in order to breathe take care of horse bring solitude to my storm and everything go on back home become a distant memory that was at least until the day my father show up at the ranch I was in the dusty stable and I see he walk towards out the corner of my eye and I just know the time have come and I was whisk away from my wonderland and back to a depressing reality modern medicine fail to win the fight and

harsh cold wind whip through the air and I shiver as I make my way along the path I find my target and I take a seat right in the icy snow snow cover the fresh flower lay in front of the stone a surprising sight to see after six year and undoubte the work of my father I think for a moment if this outcome would be the same today year later hope that at least there would be something more to add to the fight today ring through my head though I was not so sure that any more progress have actually been make friend and family come after the end and donate thousand of dollar to cancer research one could only hope that the money have actually been put to work and not use just to fund some unimportant project sit there was a look into the depth and proof now more then ever society need a cure child should never have to lose a parent to such a horrible disease human life is at great risk and for the sustainability of life to continue we can no long afford not to take risk in

first off you need to understand the 2 stage of hep c understand the stage in hep c might help with the discission you make on weather to try the chemo treatment or go with the alternative medacine way let I try and help you understand the difference here it go there is an initial acute stage of hepatitis c and there is chronic hepatitis c acute hepatitis c may last approximately six month while many patient may have no symptom some patient may experience fatigue loss of appetite jaundice yellow of the skin and abdominal pain the abdominal pain may indicate that the liver have become swollen or tender as most patient are unable to fight off the hcv virus without intervention the disease then move on to the chronic stage chronic hepatitis c is of extremely long duration usually progress over a period of 10 to 30 year approximately 80 of the infected population will enter this stage where the disease may lead to cirrhosis liver cancer and liver failure in some case the disease is fatal to sum this all up a person who have have hep c for more than 6 month move into the cronic stage where the virus no long have a chance to clear on its own thus the only prove way to eradicate the virus is to do treatment once a person have moove from the acute stage to the cronic stage there are no herbal method that are prove to do what treatment can do which is help you reach an undetectable viral load so if anybody is in the acute stage I would suggest try alternative way before treatment but once you become cronic your only hope to clear the virus is the chemo treatment hope htis help some to understand take care all xoxox brave rabbit,neutral,neutral

triple tx for post liver transplant hey marilyn this is the article kat was refer to yesterday postliver transplantation patient with recurrent hcv this case is a 58 year old white woman who receive liver transplantation in 2009 she is being maintain on tacrolimus immunosuppression and is receive multiple concurrent medication for comorbiditie her creatinine is 1 4 mg dl she have recurrent genotype 1 hcv a biopsy perform 3 year after transplantation show grade 2 inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis what would you recommend for this patient jordan j feld md mile per hour this is a difficult case she already have f2 fibrosis and we certainly know that fibrosis can progress rapidly post transplantation 36 I would be concern that if we do not think about therapy soon she will run into trouble on the other hand there are challenge with treat she we could assume that among her concurrent medication are tacrolimus or cyclosporine which will complicate current treatment 37 moreover her creatinine is already mildly elevate if treatment is pursue it should be do by an experienced clinician therapeutic drug monitoring would need to be perform if a pi were to be concomitantly administer with tacrolimus or cyclosporine to ensure level are appropriate however I think I would err on the side of consider treatment for her michael w fry md safety is certainly a concern in these patient this is an area that have been inadequately study until recently numerous case series document the treatment of small number of post transplant patient are now being report 38 39 the big safety issue for these patient appear to be anemia these patient almost universally require erythropoietin and several have receive blood transfusion they often have some renal insufficiency which will contribute to ribavirin associate anemia the addition of a pi would add far to the risk of anemia in addition manage the immunosuppressant therapy is also particularly challenge due to potential drugdrug interaction there are some datum to suggest that simeprevir tmc435 do not have the same drugdrug interaction potential with tacrolimus and cyclosporine as do the first generation protease inhibitor 40 stefan zeuzem md to consider treatment for this patient it is urgent that she is willing and able to come to the office 1 2 time per week for monitoring of drug level hemoglobin and clinical issue mark s sulkowski md monitoring is an important aspect of start treatment for any of these complex patient during the past year and a half we have all learn to monitor patient quite closely when we are concerned about toxicity of current therapy that monitoring require frequent laboratory analysis and visit in summary for patient in the post transplantation set a reason to treat is the substantial risk of progressive liver disease a challenge with treating is the complicated drugdrug interaction with both cyclosporine and tacrolimus however these can be manage when experience clinician are involve close monitoring is clearly an important aspect hope this is helpful respectfully henry,neutral,neutral

I am a 21 year old university student and tomorrow is my mom 9th memorial day I was 12 when she die of lung and brain cancer and even though it is been 9 year today I am feel a flood of emotion that I think I have feel behind my mom and I were very close she was my teacher caretaker and good friend I am an only child and my mom have a very turbulent relationship with my dad and on top this all of our relative are in japan so my mom and I rely on each other for everything she was my rock until I was 10 when she become ill will colon cancer at the time I know how severe cancer was but I do not show how sad or scared I was because I do not want my parent and especially my mom to worry that summer I was send away to my grandmother in japan while my mom go through a gruele three month of surgery and chemo luckily the treatment have work and everything was back to normal for the next two year but one day in december of 2004 while visit a family friend in san fransisco my mom become very ill I know something was wrong but being the tough woman that she was she never say anything until come back home the doctor have discover that the cancer have spread to her lung brain and other lymph node it was too late when they discover this and they give she six month to live as a 12 year old I know exactly what was happen but I never shed a tear in front of she the cancer was aggressive and there was not much we could do for she but she want to stay home as much as possible so for about a month or so she have at home care the horrible thing I see and hear are still sear into my memory on day like today I can still hear she scream and cry my name while she slowly lose control of her own body it was so heartbreaking to see she refuse to eat because of the sore in her mouth and struggle to communicate because the cancer was destroy her brain cell each day she was become more and more of a stranger my dad was supportive but he was so helpless and that make I so furious three month after the diagnosis she die in the palliative care unit the last thing she whisper to I at her death bed was that now it was my turn to be the mom and look after the house so I take this to heart and I have been fulfil her wish ever since I was never give the permission to cry or grieve or even speak her name since her death it was just my dad and I leave with no other family member to support we he was always distant from my mom and I so the though of live with basically a stranger was terrify our way of cope was to not speak of this at all and this have continue ever since I never talk to any of my friend about this because I do not want to upset they I feel so alone and depressed but now that I was the mom I become so good at hide the shame guilt and loss if I was not do housework I fill any open time with extra curricular activity so that I do not have to think about it this lead to a self destructive burnout land I in therapy now after a year of therapy I am finally allow myself to grieve and think of she this is the very first memorial day where I am allow myself to be sad and to cry I feel so embarrassed that I am a 21 year old crying for mommy but I think this is something that I prevent myself from do all these year it is finally catch up to I it hard to think of happy time with she because the image of her sickness is still so overwhelming I wish that I have sibling or other family who ve experience this with I since my dad is still unapproachable I am feel so anxious about tomorrow because I want do to something to commemorate she but all I have do in the past year is to ignore the day completely do you have any suggestion of what to do how do you spend your mom memorial day,very negative,very negative

hi everyone it have been a while since I have been here I finish my chemo in january and two week later I go to a cancer clinic in tijuana mexico because I do not want to just stop and do nothing I meet so many interesting people there two were man who have stage 4 cancer before they start the program one was prostate which have spread to his either liver or lung I can not remember which he start on the tonic and herb and diet and do not tell his american oncologist they are baffle and his record say unexplainable remission another have lung cancer that he have to take chemo for 4 year it too have spread to another organ the doctor tell he chemo was just not work anymore within 10 month after he start the program his cancer was go these case history give I hope that there is more than just chemo that can help since I have already go through all my chemo and seem to be ok they put I on a very small dose of tonic which is make of many different plant I also take three capsule of ground up yew needle with each meal I do not consume any sugar except for a very small amount of raw sugar at time I can use honey and stevia to sweeten herbal tea also no white flour anything contain vinegar tomatoes pork and try to avoid anything with preserative the idea is to eat as many fresh and natural thing as possible I am to go to mexico in july the cost of the program is 3 500 00 for the tonic and the yew capsule are extra and any x ray and doctor fee are extra but are not all that bad I was there at the clinic only one day it is a 5 year program so that is only 700 a year I read recently that someone with colon cancer opt to try the gerson program which is 25 000 00 and require a long stay in mexico as do some of the other program down there a couple of week ago I see a lady who have liver cancer about 10 or 12 year ago she opt to not have any surgery or take any treatment but read a book by hulda clark and when on herb she recommend which are only 3 tincture of walnut wormwood and clove she also go on an all natural diet I really do not understand all the other thing that she do but I have order the book it is a scary thing to finish chemo then just wait and wonder if when cc will strike again recently I have 4 test and thankfully everything is normal cea ct colonoscopy and pap I am so happy my church and prayer group have play such an important part in get I through all of this I know I still have a purpose god have spare I for a reason and I praise he daily for all that he have do for I so many time I go to prayer service with my pump hook up to my port they would gather around I and lie hand on and pray we strongly believe in that in our church I am not by any mean advocate give up conventional chemotherapy but there are alternative that work and if anyone feel apprehensive about what to do after chemo like I do you might want to go on an anti cancer diet or try some herb and so on keep the immune system strong god bless all of you barbara,negative,negative

alcoholism is a disease of the body thinking emotion and spirit progressive damage to these four aspect interact in various way such that a person is increasingly compel to drink also once drink start they can not a always guarantee when they will stop or how much they will drink the body a genetic predisposition fifty percent of alcoholic have an inherit genetic makeup that almost guarantee they would become alcoholic when they begin to drink heavily for example the brain chemistry of some child or grandchild of alcoholic actually encourage heavy drinking alcohol metabolism alcohol is metabolize differently by some people as a result the body and brain require more alcohol to have the same effect than normal drinker would need cell alteration all heavy drinker undergo change at the cellular level of the brain where the brain cell meet extra receptor position grow to receive the heavy dose of alcohol relate chemical messenger when not drink these extra receptor position demand to be fill thus create a craving for alcohol brain damage alcohol in any quantity is poisonous to brain cell and kill off cell in their million the most critically affect part of the brain are those that deal with short term memory decision making and rational thinking woman heavy drinker develop brain damage with less drinking than man liver damage the most common liver disease of alcoholic is cirrhosis scar of the liver this disease result in reduce and corrupt chemical being send to the body which can result in damage to other organ woman suffer liver damage with less alcohol consumption than man alcoholic hepatitis ah ah is cause by other liver disease most notably cirrhosis of the liver more than 60 of person who develop both ah and cirrhosis will die within four year ah can cause change in sleep pattern mood and personality psychiatric condition such as anxiety and depression shorten attention span and problem with coordination may occur brain chemical the body and especially the brain rely on the liver to filter important body fluid and excrete waste as a result of contaminated chemistry from a damage liver the brain do not function properly typically a person will have cloudy and slow think heart damage heavy drinking cause damage to the heart muscle the heart pump less blood and an abnormal heart beat may develop woman suffer heart damage with less alcohol consume than man skeletal muscle heavy drinking cause muscle in the arm and leg to shrink for example an alcoholic may have leg that are out of proportion skinny than the rest of their body sufferer may become embarrassed about their body shape cancer the risk of cancer increase with great alcohol consumption more so in woman cancer can develop in the upper airway the liver breast and the bowel sexual organ and sexuality heavy alcohol use shrink the testicle in man and woman the breast grow large man produce more female hormone and woman produce more male hormone man become less virile and woman become less feminine as a result a person sexuality and libido is alter they may sense change in their sexuality and over compensate by become more sexually active indiscriminate or intoxicated sexual activity raise the risk of get sexually transmit disease think as detail before various damaged body organ and altered chemistry affect how the brain think this buildup of think change occur over an extended time period these small change are usually unseen by the sufferer the person react by adjust their reasoning and behavior to accommodate their new way of think alcoholic always adjust their thinking in way that are harmful to themselves and far they can not see the impact of their new cope style typically they begin to adopt a siege mentality inner self feedback and from other people indicate they are not quite at one with their a inner self or the person they once were their experience seem to paint a picture to the sufferer that people around they are against they or are well than they or are just different from themselves they become insecure angry ashamed depressed and anxious about their altered attitude and action this siege mentality generate a self center perspective to protect their self concept they become taker and non giver I want what I want and I want it now sort of thing I need a drink now regardless of the need of other and when they do not get it they assert themselves even more become more demanding as the disease progress alcoholic will increasingly try to cope by drink more alcohol to take away the pain of their perception of being isolate in thinking and behavior they slowly adopt a denial attitude to their real condition which they eventually believe is reality for they the alcoholic drink more due to a different brain chemistry and metabolism have crave for more alcohol due to cell alteration and organ damage and drink more to cope with the effect of their change thinking and behavior they are drink to feel normal the emotion from the above it can easily be see that their emotion become strained and twist they become emotionally dependent on achieve and keep a state of denial of their true situation they deny it to themselves and other if their alcoholism is in threat of being expose or their alcohol supply is threaten they may protect themselves with anger bluff self pity manipulation depression run away and so on they a feel as if they must continue their current emotional and think stance at all cost alcohol have become their good friend and they are loyal to it the spirit the spirit of a person is the center of their personality if as see above the person is not think feeling or act as their true self would not align with their spiritual self they are spiritually ill at ease or this ease a solution the progression of the disease must be arrest by stop drinking and restoration of health in all four area body thinking emotion and spirit it is the this ease spiritual state that is target by the most successful recovery service world wide alcoholic anonymous aa through the twelve step of recovery each person find their inner spiritual self by strip away the effect of alcoholism and fix

this might answer some of your concern as to why a virus do not act like a virus discovery of mechanism that allow hepatitis c virus to remain in the body for decade 19 august 2009 07 39 researcher at the university of leed have discover a previously unknown mechanism that allow the hepatitis c virus hcv to remain in the body for decade a study publish in the proceeding of the national academy of sciences pnas show that the virus block the action of a specific ion channel in the cell membrane that would usually trigger apoptosis the cell self destruct programme and in do so have evolve another way of protect itself from being eliminate from the body apoptosis occur naturally in the body to allow the removal of unhealthy cell or the replacement of worn out cell one of the way in which apoptosis can be trigger in a cell is to reduce its potassium level this can happen when the cell is expose to oxidative stress that activate a specific ion channel which act as a pore in the cell membrane cause it to open and allow out potassium ion however the research team have discover that a protein make by hcv know as ns5a is able to block the activation of this ion channel in liver cell enable these cell to resist cell death for long for a virus to persist in the body over a long time it have to find a way of manipulate the host cell so that it become resistant to apoptosis say lead researcher professor mark harris of the universitys faculty of biological science we know of many way that virus have evolve to do this but this is the first observation of a virus prevent cell death by manipulate an ion channel hcv affect some 170 million people globally and only around half of these will respond to treatment many sufferer will be asymptomatic some for twenty or even thirty year but the virus remain in the liver and its long tem damage can ultimately cause cirrhosis or cancer cell in the liver are often expose to high level of oxidative and other stress as they work to detoxify the blood of foreign compound such as drug and alcohol and to remove chemical produce by our own body say professor harris in addition the virus itself cause oxidative stress as it replicate in the cell the research show that the virus have evolve another way of protect itself from this natural process and to avoid elimination from the body for long the research team believe that continue research may offer a potential target for drug development perhaps through combination therapy we need to find out exactly how the block action work but it is possible that two drug could be couple together one to prevent the virus from block the ion channel and another to induce stress to force apoptosis say professor harris it is a very exciting discovery and ideally we d like to expand our investigation to see whether other virus that cause long term or chronic infection such as hiv have evolve the same ability the research was fund by the medical research council,neutral,neutral

fist of all I am so glad I find this group I was just talk to my wife last night about how no one seem to get the strain on step parent so yeah yay and sorry if I am too wordy with that say I was wonder what other experience have been with sporadic bio parent in my case I have been with my wife for 9 year married for 7 and the kid were 10 and 12 when we get together their father at the same time our relationship begin decide to cut they out of his life entirely at the behest of his then new and now ex wife this include not only emotional abandonment but a year where he decide to play child support game only show up in their life again to work out an arrangement with my wife that would keep he from imprisonment then disappear again during that time our daughter experience the onset of epilepsy and was eventually diagnose with brain cancer and throughout all of it he never have anything to do with her care show up for her main brain surgery and ask what kind of seizure do she have anyway when he do show up at the hospital our daughter get her hope up that this time he will care only to be devastate when he show no interest in she after care or offer any bit of assistance with the rigorous chemo radiation process that involve drive 2 hour on a daily basis for treatment throughout all of this I was the primary breadwinner for the family and obviously the child have always come first needless to say I think he is worthless but now after his divorce coincide with the birth of our son son he have pop back up in their life again I understand logically that now that the child are adult they have get every right to determine what their relationship with he is from my end though it is madden because all of a sudden now that there is no financial consequence to he or any real work on his part he is a change man I do not really know where to put this frustration because it is not fair to the kid to berate he much as I would like to but his re appearance seem to have diminish all the hard work and sacrifice I have put in to see they through their formative year have anyone else out there experience this if so how do you cope,negative,negative

my doctor find a 4 cm polyp in my cecum during a routine colonoscopy I was shocked because I think I was the pillar of health and there were no symptom he say it look benign but he could not tell for sure and that he would send some biopsy specimen to pathology the pathology report say that they it was a tubulovillous adenoma which mean it was a benign polyp however my doctor say that he still could not be sure that the whole polyp was benign because those specimen were just a small part of the polyp he say that he must remove the polyp totally to see if there were part of cancer in there I was tell that even if it was totally benign it still have to be remove because adenomas over time turn into cancer so now was the search to find a doctor to remove it I go to one surgeon and he say that he would have to remove ten inch of my intestine the lymph nod the polyp and most of the cecum because even though it might be a benign polyp it might be cancerous and he do not want to have to do another surgery I was tell I would be in the hospital for a week to ten day and home for three week and that this surgery was being do with general anesthesia also my stomach would never been the same but I would learn to readjust and eat differently to avoid problem go to the bathroom I go to another surgeon and he basically say the same thing so I research the internet and I find an alternate method which few doctor care to mention I discover that large polyp in the cecum can be remove with a special type of colonoscopy use emr I was tell that the cecum is extremely thin about 2 dime thick and only a handful of very skilled doctor can remove a large polyp with an emr colonoscopy I do my research and I find two renowned doctor from new york city dr haber and dr waye who have the expertise to do this procedure I choose doctor jerome waye to remove my 4 cm polyp I schedule my procedure with dr waye do my prep for this polypectomy walk in on the day schedule and in one hour later walk out feel fine the doctor remove the entire polyp after I have to eat soft food and food with no fiber for 4 day I stay home the next day but probably if I have to could have go to work the following week I call the office and I was tell that my 4 cm polyp in my cecum was not cancerous I promise myself that if I have a positive outcome I would post something on this health board because when I originally find out I have a 4 cm polyp and go online to research it everything everywhere say it was doom and gloom website were give statistic about the size of the polyp in relationship to the possibility of it being cancerous it look to I I could not have escape cancer since it was so large they were wrong also all the blog I read say that after the speciman say it was benign when they totally take it out there was some cancer in it mine have no cancer in it after the entire polyp was remove all the people were blogge that their 4 cm benign polyp turn out to be stage 3 or stage 4 after totally remove it I was cancer free people who have benign polyp specimen still go through major surgery I go the colonoscopy emr route my intestine and colon was not compromise I do not go through major surgery like most doctor recommend and my inside are the same as before so if you just find out you have a large polyp in your cecum and it look benign there is hope it probably will be totally benign have faith because now you know my story also if it is in the cecum you might want to go the emr colonoscopy route I am not a doctor and can not tell you what to do I can only tell you what I do and how my nightmare end on a positive note good luck to you I,positive,positive

I have read a lot of discussion about smoking being a factor for develop lung cancer and also not being one and their thought towards it I agree that smoking for the most part is not the wise of idea if your wanting to lead a healthy life I do not agree with the fact that it cause it since I know too many people that have smoke many year and never develop lung cancer I believe that it is cause from a breakdown in the immune system where essential vitamin are lose or need and of course gene that are pass down to we it seem by now that they could detect these gene and also give something to people especially over the age of 50 to strengthen the immune system and make good cell strong to fight the bad cell that spread cancer my mom do develop lung cancer and do smoke so she do fall under that stereotype of lung cancer but there are very many that never have without cigarette my mom would of been miserable in her later day because that is all she have since she was a widow by 7 year when she past away and they comfort she and relax she and she enjoy it very much by the way she have degenerative bone disease since her early twenty and have always suffer with bone pain for many year she also become diabetic in her 50 so I have to think that just possibly the cancer come from some of those factor since I see a lot of people have diabete and then cancer I have read an article about cancer and it state that cancer cell love sugar so you should really watch your sugar intake I am glad my mom have her cigarette because they were like a good friend to she and she would of been miserable without in her final month so I do not blame she for that at all or the cigarette as I mention too many people who do not smoke or drink develop cancer as my mother in law even do and die at the age of 53 like her father who do not smoke and it was determined that it was an aggressive genetic cancer now we have to worry about my husband and our child whom it would not matter what they do because his mom eat very healthy and do not have bad habit I guess my message is that you should do what make you happy and try to limit some of the bad of course but just be comfortable in what you are do because life can be too short to do without and my mom die do what she love and I would not have it any other way and good for she we love you mom I think you should just do what ever make you feel good because in the end it would not matter because what go to happen will happen and that is that it is aggravating but I really am start to believe 100 in that I also do not like the way people who develop lung cancer are treat by some and especially doctor do not blame yourself for this disease just because it is call lung cancer my heart go out to all of you suffer with this disease good luck and good wish for success,positive,positive

october 13 2009 is a virus the cause of fatigue syndrome by denise grady could a virus be the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome a study publish last week in the journal science suggest that might be the case report that many patient who have the syndrome were infect with a recently discover virus chronic fatigue syndrome have long been a medical mystery and the subject of debate sometimes bitter among doctor researcher and patient it affect at least one million americans cause extreme fatigue muscle and joint pain sleep problem difficulty concentrate and other symptom its cause is unknown symptom can last for year and there is no effective treatment researcher disagree about whether it is one disease or a collection of symptom that may have different cause in different patient it have sometimes been stigmatize as more mental than physical with patient label neurotic depressed or hypochondriacal many patient find even the name of the disorder offensive a not so subtle hint that it is not a real disease the new report have intrigue scientist been see as vindication by some patient and inspire hope for a treatment I just feel like the whole future have change for we say anne ursu 36 a writer live in cleveland who have have the syndrome in the past but the new study is not conclusive and a great deal of work remain to be do to find out whether the new virus really do play a role just detect it in patient do not prove it is what make they sick people with the syndrome may have some other underlying problem that make they susceptible to the virus which could be just a passenger in their cell even so thousand of patient have already contact scientist ask to be test say dr judy mikovits the first author of the study and the research director at the whittemore peterson institute in reno a research center create by the parent of a woman who have the syndrome dr mikovits say she expect a test to become available within week the new suspect is a xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate virus or xmrv which probably descend from a group of virus that cause cancer in mouse how or when xmrv find its way into human is unknown but it have also been link to cancer in people it was first identify three year ago in prostate cancer and later detect in about one quarter of biopsy from man with that disease and in only 6 percent of benign biopsy it is a retrovirus from the same notorious family that cause aid and leukemia in people dr mikovit and researcher from the national cancer institute and the cleveland clinic report in science that 68 of 101 patient with chronic fatigue syndrome or 67 percent were infect with xmrv compare with only 3 7 percent of 218 healthy control subject further testing after the paper was write find the virus in nearly 98 percent of about 300 patient with the syndrome dr mikovits say she say she believe that the virus would eventually be find in every patient with chronic fatigue syndrome xmrv affect the immune system can probably cause a variety of illness and may join force with other virus to bring on the syndrome she say the study receive a mixed review from dr william c reeve who direct public health research on the syndrome at the center for disease control and prevention he call the research exciting but preliminary and say he was surprised that a prestigious journal like science have publish it because the researcher do not state the age or sex of the patient and control or describe the duration of the illness or how it come on if I do not know the nature of the case and control I can not interpret the finding dr reeve say we and other are look at our own specimen and try to confirm it he say add if we validate it great my expectation is that we will not he note that there have been false start before include a study in the 1990 link the syndrome to another retrovirus which could not be confirm by later research many patient and a community of doctor and researcher who specialize in the syndrome take issue with the disease center approach to the illness and the way it define who is affect they claim that the c d c include people whose problem are purely psychiatric muddy the water and confound effort to find a physical cause frustration with the lack of answer lead annette and harvey whittemore whose 31 year old daughter have have the syndrome for 20 year to spend several million dollar to set up a research institute at the university of nevada in reno in 2004 and to hire dr mikovit to direct it mrs whittemore say she have long believe that the syndrome was an infectious disease but that scientist have reject the idea she finally decide she say if there was a place of our own where we could find the answer we could do it more quickly dr william schaffner an infectious disease expert at vanderbilt university say that the notion of a linger viral infection was plausible he say that although some patient claim to have the syndrome seem more likely to have a psychological problem other seem to have a physical illness there is a group who are young healthy active and engage and all of a sudden they are lay low by something dr schaffner say everyone tell the physician these are people who are functional and productive and this is totally out of character they are frustrated and often quite dishearten you feel that medical science have not catch up with their illness yet to determine whether xmrv is to blame more study are need say dr john coffin a professor of molecular biology and microbiology at tufts university it would help to find an animal model he say and to look at store blood sample to find out if there were people who become ill some set amount of time after contract the virus if antiviral drug make patient improve that will also help make the case against the virus he say the national cancer institute is take xmrv seriously say dr stuart le grice head of its center of excellence in hiv aids and cancer virology he say health official become especially concerned last spring when several research team look at prostate cancer report find xmrv in 3 percent to 4 percent of blood sample from healthy people in control group that could translate into 10 million american being infect with a newly discover poorly understand retrovirus that have already been link to two disease any virus at that level is obviously cause for concern dr le grice say add that it was important to find out if the virus was associate with any more disease and how closely he say that just carry the virus do not necessarily mean a person was at high risk for disease note that people may harbor other virus that will never harm they the immune system probably keep the virus in check but he ask if it is a problem how well can we diagnose it and how well can we treat it even though antiretroviral drug have already been develop to treat h i v infection he say this virus was different and might need its own line of drug he say more study were need to find out how common the virus is and how it is being transmit it is not know whether people can catch the disease from mouse or can infect one another retrovirus are

I am sure all of we remember a point in time when we as kid think nothing could hurt bad than a stubbed toe since then as we have get more and more damage our definition of the bad pain ever have change and change again this is why I think the doctor ask I what my pain level is on a scale of 1 to 10 is so useless what someone else find a 9 like get a tattoo I might not even notice what I consider a good day at a 4 might be someone else 10 or even bad their 4 might by my 10 when I was work as a nurse a zillion year ago a teenage kid come into the office in a wheelchair two week early he was the captain of the basketball team the doctor demand he be on the table to be check out so as carefully as I could I pick he up and put he on the table and he scream for five minute this was repeat when I put he back in the wheelchair that always strike I as what a 10 look like the good news is that the doctor I work for find the correct diagnosis of leukemia and within a month he was out play basketball again but I will never forget that 15 year old kid so where was I go with all of this level of pain we can all understand an immediate ouch of hit our hand against something most of we are hip on the dull ache of old injury or arthritis of of arthritis bring about by old injury that pain that is always there but that we can still say that this spot hurt and this area ache and this spot hurt most of all but after that come where the pain area start to blend together instead of my know hurt my whole leg hurt or I do not know where the pain is originate but this whole area of my body is kill I then there is what I call a fine line and hubby call a shelf where the amount of pain exceed the brain ability to process it anymore at which point everything hurt more of less equally high brain function are overwrite as the brain use all synapsis to try to process pain everything below that point can usually be treat more effectively with pain med or otc method massage aleve ten unit and so on once the brain can do nothing but rattle around with the pain impulse it is hard to get back under the line that shelf to where something can be do to fix it I have find that there is actually one more level in pain it is one I try to avoid at all cost it is where the brain just stop accept pain input a blockade go up and pain sense are not feel anymore a numbness fill the place I know should be scream I can feel nothing but I get cognitive function back but I pay for any activity I do while numb when I go back to pain,positive,positive

hello team just want to give a quick update I was suppose to be get my first day of chemo today for bmt but the doctor at stanford throw we a curve ball last week my nih doctor have diagnose I with myeologenous hypereosinophilic syndrome chronic eosinophilic leukemia m he s cel this is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm mpn after my third bone marrow biopsy the doctor at stanford have a slightly different approach their diagnosis is systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological non mast cell disease that is likely chronic eosinophilic leukemia sm ahnmd cel in addition to the vast number of eosinophil in my bone marrow all of the biopsy have show aggregate of spindle shape mast cell my nih doc say that the differ diagnosis are semantic apparently eosinophil and mast cell hang in the same biological circle so in the absence of specific genetic clonality it is impossible to say whether my disease is primarily eosinophilic with secondary mastocytosis or primarily mastocytosis with secondary eosinophilia welcome to the wonderful world of have an uber rare disease more than six month in and still no diagnosis when I ask my doc for any sort of prognosis they all look at each other and shrug their shoulder with the exception of say that it will eventually kill I if we do not get it under control that could be one month or five year either way we are look at this new option as a blessing despite the uncertainty we are now establish a path to get this new drug midostaurin which is a tki that have have limited success in aml patient the doctor do not want to leave I off of any treatment as my absolute eosinophil count aec continue to slowly rise last cbc I have a wbc of 27 with aec at 20 5 they start I on hydroxyurea 1 gram day to see if that would lower the count as a bridge strategy to get to midostaurin midostaurin just finish phase ii trial and is not approve by the fda novartis is the drug company and they must say yes for compassionate use as well as the fda which may take 2 month or more then another two month to see if it work my doctor who was primary investigator on the trial is unsure if it will work but think it is worth the risk to wait to try of the 116 patient in the trial 5 present in a similar manner sm ahnmd with cel 4 of those 5 have a complete resolution of their eosinophilia additionally for those of you follow the beat aml initiative my doctor also send off my blood for evaluation with jeff tyner use the same technique for aml genome mapping with the hope that another tki might be well suit for I than even midostaurin http www ll org who we are a new approach to drug discovery src1 35591 src2 as I have become more and more versed on this subject I am more and more encouraged by the progress in beat myeologenous leukemia of all form I am fairly certain that in 20 year leukemia of this variety will be treat first with induction then tki to vastly reduce chance of relapse and then bmt only in rare occasion cml have mostly been beat replace by take a pill with few side effect we can do this too with aml I would encourage all of you out there to write your doc to send any blood that may still be store to jeff tyner and the lab if pathway exist I remember dave tell I at the beginning of this journey for I that we are all part of the process to beat this disease I take that to heart and wholeheartedly agree what I would ask of the team for I personally is to continue pray specifically for the wisdom to make the right choice between bmt and drug therapy for protection of my heart and other organ from all the eosinophil for hydroxyurea to work as a bridge strategy and for midostaurin to be approve for I and to work if you have any experience with hydroxyurea or midostaurin I would appreciate any info as well we are so thankful for you all and pray for everyone here daily hope and health for everyone vr john,positive,positive

hello I have a few question about my mother health she is 80 and until two year ago was in reasonably good health except for allergy and glaucoma she was self sufficient for the past two year she have have increase muscle pain and immobility severe trouble walk she is been chairbound in late june of this year after go to bed she start hemorrage from the vagina it was severe previously over the past 15 year she is have other vaginal bleeding episode though not as severe and have consider it fibroid the blood loss leave she very anemic and her hemoglobin count drop to 7 8 subsequently she receive two unit of blood transfuse currently without more transfusion her hemoglobin read is just above 10 the pain could be severe arthritis feed by her immobility and by the fact we reside in a steamy southern climate or it could be metastastic cancer during this hospital stay the family doctor turn her case over to an ob gyn who do an ultrasound and subsequently a scraping for a tissue sample from the uterus the result have been a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the uterus the family doctor put she on 80 mg twice daily of megestrol acetate a synthetic progesterone for the cancer that should also act as an appetite stimulant by virtue of the fact that she have have female bleeding over the year previously is there any slim chance that their lab work is wrong and it might be fibroid benign after all could the severe arthritis she have experience which might account for her excruciating neck and back pain possibly be relate to this heavy uterine bleed episode two month later in mid september she fall at home break she left hip and before midday the hip was surgically repair and before midday was leave in a sling to heal she is just about to come home again after over three month in rehabilitation learn to walk again however she is still in great pain take oxycodone every four hour and not walk very much at all certainly not at all without a walker and someone right there to steady she since she fall she have need oxygen she never need it before the oxygen set on the machine is at about 2 and a half x ray then in september show nothing wrong with the lung but because she almost fall in the rehab center her fall was break by an aide about ten day ago fresh xray were just take the family doctor just call with the troubling news that the xray of the lung now show several spot which he think are the cancer of the uterus metasticize to the lung he suggest a catscan to rule out a weird infection but he is pretty sure it is cancer base on the x ray if it is cancer he suggest a cancer hormone such as tomoxifen but say she should consult an oncologist because he is not familiar with dosing I suppose this is essentially chemotherapy she is 80 and I do not know how well she will tolerate it he say without treatment she might only have a couple of month but possibly the tomoxifen might buy a few month he also suggest she enter a hospice program they would monitor she and pay for any drug she could receive hospice care at home at this point she want to come home and is afraid of other test or take cancer drug I think the terminal nature of hospice would scare and demoralize she far he say the xray indicate severe osteoporosis of the spine and that the before midday while not break again really is not heal just about three week ago the surgeon take xray of the before midday and find it improve enough to authorize full weight bearing in physical therapy the family doctor now advise maybe she should not do physical therapy it might be too hard on her soft brittle bone as to walk she can only if she want to she is in a lot of pain and on oxycodone presently the doctor is suggest combine that with a long act pain patch but I have hear concern about their safety I ask he about the pain patch and safety and he as much as say that at this point it do not matter this family doctor also say her blood work look ok and there was no cancer report in the pathology of the hip from the surgery spot on the xray where there were none in september but she was start to need oxygen full time then in september could these spot be other than cancer she seem to come down with a virus about three week ago that was go through the rehab center she have a slight fever and a sour stomach with some shortness of breath I have also wonder if possibly any of her medication include to regulate her heart beat and for blood pressure might have a side effect of leave spot on her lung if it is lung cancer just how dangerous would tomoxifen be are there any alternative safe treatment either from conventional medicine or from the holistic world that might help she have never smoke your response will be appreciate and gratefully consider,negative,negative

she have a nose tube put in for 2 week and that was finally remove she have have her first round of chemo 7 3 and on day 14 another bone marrow biopsy which unfortunately do not put the leukemia into

she was start or a more aggressive chemo which last for only 5 day and this round consist of 2 of the same drug but at a high potency and they add 2 other she was on idarubicin cytarabin fludarabine and another f drug that help produce new white blood cell this one was more of a hormone not a chemo drug and she was on this for a few more than 5 day due to the last drug they have to wait at least 30 day before they do another bone marrow biopsy or they would get a false positive tomorrow will be day 30 and she have finally recover from the chemo and all her count are back to normal therefore this friday they will do her amputation they will also have to clean out her original wound in her groin from the previous 3 surgery due to the chemo she do not completely heal and once she get her strength back and start walk with point her wound start to open and the staple start to separate from the wound they have been pack the wound to prevent it from any further infection this is painful but this pain do not last long like her toe pain she have in the beginning after she recover from surgery and they feel she is stable and they see no complication from surgery she will be move back to the oncology floor where they will do another bone marrow biopsy I just pray that this last aggressive round of chemo will put she into remission if not wellafter have this amputation and see the effect of her original wound not heal I m scare I know to think positive but it scare I after say all of thiswhat happen if the chemo do not workwith all of her other complication I feel like she may

just think I would post this about milk thistle if you re in treatment I do not know if you re suppose to take it maybe you should ask your doctor I do not take it while I was in treatment but do take

liver from harmful toxin and help treat liver disease the silymarin in milk thistle help people with hepatitis b and hepatitis c serious liver disease get well 10 12 while silymarin can not cure cirrhosis a very destructive and often fatal liver disease it can improve liver function in people with this serious disease 13 15 in fatty liver disease often cause by excessive alcohol drinking and often lead to cirrhosis silymarin can protect the liver from further damage 16 17 and while we do not necessarily think of medication as toxin many over thecounter drug and prescription medication can

detoxify the deadly poison from the amanita phalloide or death cap mushroom the death cap mushroom as its name imply is one of the most poisonous mushroom in the world contain toxin that are particularly harmful to the liver accidentally eat this mushroom can cause severe liver damage and even death silymarin not only bind to the liver cell prevent damage from the mushroom it also neutralize the deadly death cap poison 22 25 while mushroom poisoning should always be treat as a lifethreatening emergency and urgent care seek immediately it is amazing that an herbal compound can detoxify such a dangerous substance finally the liver have the remarkable capacity to completely regenerate after it have been injure the liver is the only organ besides blood and skin that have this

I keep test on the low side for platelet wbc and rbc I am wonder about something I read I read that the body put iron in the liver when there is an infection to hide it from the infection it say that the bacteria need iron to multiply so the body is hide the iron in the liver as a protective measure if there is a viral infection do the body hide the iron in the liver too and since the hcv virus live and multiplie in the liver do it do that because it have find the iron and since the infection do not go away with hep c and it being slow progressing is it possible that when your blood is test the iron is hide in the liver and do not show up in a routine blood test my rbc go down when my viral load go up from 1 8 million to 5 million I have read or hear that the virus can take vacation in many place in the body that although it replicate in the liver cell that it also travel in the blood stream and can camp out and take a break from replication hep c cell have been find in bone and other place in the body they can be dormant there for year and then get back to the liver and start replicate again which is why the virus is so hard to totally eliminate it is reasonable then to surmise that since the virus is not a cell it do not follow cell protocol and do not need to do anything at all to survive what kill the tiny viral unit I read an article about how small they are 3 million small pox virus lay in a flat circle would cover an area the size of a period if one of those virus was the size of a brick the hep c virus would be the size of a blueberry next to it,neutral,neutral

hi everybody I just want to say that accord to scientific research more then half of people who have hep c never develop liver cirrhosis or cancer of cause if you have a certain life style like no drinking or smoke healthy diet and if you do not have other health problem they say if you make it to 60 with hep c most likely you will die from something else it do not apply to everyone though again of cause it is well to get rid off it and start treatment no doubt but I think we scare all these young people on this site let we be more positive and optimistic especially because we can see clearly on this site that it have more success story then the other way around as I say million of people live with it happily cause they do not know they have it and only 1 5 develop cirrhosis or liver canceragain hip c is not sickness it just a condition in which the patient might develop cirrhosis or liver cancer I wish everybody to believe in yourself and believe in new triple medicine and new light med is come out soon hep c is treatable now we live in a different world cheer up,positive,positive

liver device help man survive until transplant victoria colliver chronicle staff writer wednesday july 1 2009 07 01 18 50 pdt eddie lopez a 50 year old san francisco man with cirrhosis go into liver failure in march arrive at california pacific medical center in a coma and was put on life support lopez was too sick to qualify for a liver transplant even if a donate organ become available make his odd of survival limit at good the odd could have been bad but the san francisco hospital he was in happen to be one of only seven institution nationwide test a new device design to take over the function of the bodys liver for a few hour or several day long enough to give the patient a chance to stabilize for decade researcher have struggle to create an artificial liver that would mimic both the liver ability to filter toxin as well as create vital chemical necessary to live unlike people with kidney dysfunction who can rely on a dialysis machine to keep they alive patient in acute liver failure have few option because of the organ complex nature the late device to be test is call the elad for extracorporeal liver assist device it is consider the first to have human liver cell which are contain in cartridge that the patient blood pass through to provide the liver crucial task a once promising device that use pig liver cell fail to receive food and drug administration approval because california pacific was involve in the clinical trial for elad the hospital doctor let lopezs family decide whether lopez should participate an opportunity his family decide he would want even if he do not survive because it could help other less than a day after he was hook up to the machine his sister dianna lopez say she notice his color improve and he become alert after three day he have to be remove from the machine because he develop an infection but he eventually become well enough to return home on saturday about five week after he leave the hospital lopez get the call he was wait for a donate liver have become available for he he receive a liver transplant saturday night and was recover at the hospital intensive care unit wednesday we believe the elad really do some good for he and help for he to be stable enough to get a transplant dianna lopez say it do its job dr todd frederick the medical center principal investigator for the trial say in lopezs case the elad do exactly what it was design to do the elad is not mean to replace the liver he say the goal for he was to support he through a critical period get he out of hospital and allow he to do the thing he need to do to get list for a transplant he say four patient at california pacific were hook up to the elad during the phase ii trial which end in april all have acute failure on top of chronic liver disease only two include lopez survive to leave the hospital the other survivor who have kidney disease and other health issue eventually die from pneumonia frederick say participant in the trial have to stay on the machine at least three to 10 day which is often long enough to allow patient to receive a liver transplant or return home to wait in some case patient may recover enough for the liver to regenerate avoid a transplant about 28 000 americans die each year of chronic liver disease accord to theu s center for disease control and prevention the cause is often the result of alcohol abuse or hepatitis c there also can be other medical reason a much small number about 2 000 people a year go into acute liver failure without an underlying disease the lead cause being an inadvertent overdose of acetaminophen or tylenol but donate liver are in short supply nearly 16 000 people are on the liver transplant waiting list but only about 6 500 get the operation last year the procedure most recently gain medium attention when apple ceo steve job undergo such a transplant it is great opportunity because it is a totally underserve market say terry winters chief executive of vital therapies inc the san diego company that make the elad their only competition is transplant and there are not enough liver out there to meet the demand the device use cell derive from a liver tumor because those cell unlike normal liver cell have the ability to replicate and maintain functionality winter say he say the machine filtrate device prevent those cell from reentere the patient body financial struggle the hope for the promise therapy may explain why the elad have survive while its business side have struggle the original texas company form in 1991 to create a machine use human liver cell go into bankruptcy in 1995 reform in san diego and go bankrupt again in 2003 it was quickly revive under the late incarnation winter say the elad concept have been sound the previous company have trouble come up with an effective clinical trial design allow vital therapy to raise 40 million in venture capital fund the company receive the late round of funding in 2007 28 million lead by versant venture in palo alto so far the device have been test on about 70 patient at the seven you s hospital early trial include patient from china bring the total to 119 patient worldwide

I am a 32 year old female with no family history of colon cancer background about 2 week ago I start have a pretty sharp pull muscle type pain in my low left abdomen the pain gradually get well but do not go away then I get some pretty bad low abdominal cramping that lessen throughout one day and by the end of that week I was feel kind of normal again then I over exert myself and hardly could walk the next day that leave pain was back full blast and I was fetal position on the floor the next day I call my gyn because I have 2 benign dermoid tumor on my ovary so I think the left one was cause I trouble she see I the end of that week and do a tran vag we and it come back clear by that day all my pain was go almost so that night I start feel it again mostly on the left but by the morning sleepless night from pain I could not move I was cry it hurt so bad I could not get up and my husband have to help I it feel like 6 ton of gas were trap in my abdomen and could not get out no distention though that morning I start spike a fever around 101 I decide I should go to the hospital get there and they keep tell I I do not have a fever even though I show they on my thermometer mine there was 100 2 and they say a fever is not until 100 4 they do an abdominal we and trans vag again show nothing that night I start on 800 mg of ibuprofen from my friday dr visit everything instantly get well I feel like a million buck take it for 3 day and then stop take it fever is go also come down with strep so I am not sure if the fever was from the pain or the strep my pain have stay away for the 2 day I have been off the ibuprofen soooooo today I go to the gi doctor then he push on my belly and although it was uncomfortable it do not really hurt at one point when he get to the low left I jump and wince because I was anticipate pain and there was the slight twinge then he say he want to schedule a ct and then a colonoscopy to check for diverticulitis I ask he if he think it could be colon cancer and he was hesitant to say no but he say he do not think so at my age at least I mean obviously he can not say he is absolutely sure oh postscript I have a urine culture and cbc which both come back fine anyhow give that I have gynecological issue already pco the tumor I am not sure I feel entirely comfortable with an abdominal ct if he think I have colon cancer which have not been rule out I would do it in a heartbeat but he say he is do the ct first because it is a bad idea to do a sigmoid or colonoscopy if I do in fact have diverticulitis anyhow I was research ct scan and the one he is order is equivalent to 7 year of radiation being that I already have risk factor for gynecological cancer I do not think blast radiation in to my abdomen is for I what would you all suggest I do could an mri detect diverticulitis accurately he mention the picture may not be good and then I would have to have a ct anyhow but be pay for both I am not sure what to do I am mostly worried it is a tumor cancer in which case I would want answer the fast way possible but I do not know if I should request another appt to tell he how against a ct I am he is a good doctor so I do not want to he off if it is cancer I do not want to waste time if it is not I do not want to bombard my pelvis with unnecessary radiation so do it sound like cancer any advice for the ct sorry it is so long,negative,negative

hey all was chat with mark mincolla on facebook he do a lot of healing work with cancer and various other condition I ask if he have have any success in treat hep c he say yes here was his recommendation avoid corn yolk nuts and fermented food take 3600 mg monolaurin 3000 mg lysine 1500 mg of transfer point beta glucan and natural source all liver 4 tab all food must be lightly cook and serve warm use fresh organic food only still price out all of this but so far have find the all liver at iherb for 7 50 60 tab the l lysine 1000 mg 100 for 8 40 at I herb the transfer point beta glucan was a bit pricey around 65 I think and then I come across this interesting link when google for monolaurin http www inspirednutrition com 3 2 step_hepatitis_natural_solution htmll wonder if anyone have have any positive result with any of the above mention or any thought on the recommendation mark have a health radio show and a healing center in vermont he is in boston at the moment but I have been follow his work for some time,neutral,neutral

well I am new to this support group and my story is fairly long but I will try to keep it concise my name is lottie I am 25 year old marry to nate for a little over 3 year and we have a 17 month old daughter kaya just about 2 year ago when I was 12 week pregnant nate was diagnose with acute leukemia at the time we were very excited to be expect he have lobby I to get pregnant for quite some time and the doagnosis was shocking and devastating he get into remission and get something call a bone marrow transplant in march 2011 I have kaya in july 2011 nate was ready to return to work in september 2011 sept 12 to be exact he was go back part time and was really excited about it then on the 20th of that month his father die suddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 45 nate have never been close to his father but his death send he into a downward spiral that he is been on for 14 month now after his dad die nate start abuse his medication he was prescribe oxycontin for legitimate cancer relate pain and start pop they like candy I try hide they around the house keep they with I and so on he always find they suddenly nate also decide he hate his job he was miss a lot of work he was sad all the time he end up being hospitalize in december 2011 because of suicidal thought and he lose his job because he do not have any leave leave anyways while he was in by the way his psychiatrist is at mass general in boston which is where he was inpatient they switch he from celexa to paxil fastforward to january 1st and nate have his first of many psychotic break he just snap he fly into a rage he say he hate I and never love I he say he do not care about our daughter and do not love she he say he wish he and I have never meet and that I was the cause of all his problem he leave the house go out and start smoke cigarette big no no because of his cancer he go to his brother to get drunk another no no because of his med he call around midnight to say he was sorry and was come home over the next 4 month he have weekly outburst like that always anger direct towards I always pack his bag to leave always smoke cigarette or marijuana and then always come home he was put back on celexa and they add zyprexa an anti psychotic needless to say my patience was wear thin I was try to be a good mother to my beautiful little girl and try to be a caregiver to my very mentally ill husband while withstand the verbal and emotional lashing that his moodswing produce he was eventually switch to ability from the zyprexa because he gain 50 pound but that do not really make a difference his doctor know I was at a break point finally in may nate start electro convulsive therapy or ect it is where they knock he out and electrocute his brain to induce a seizure he have it 3 time a week for a month then once a week then 1 every other week and so on until september it do wonder for his depression he was also switch to effexor because it was obvious the celexa was do nothing when he stop he start a job sell car he is not a salesman type but it was all he could find he quit 4 week after start in mid november this year say he could feel it come back as in his depression within hour he was freak out again yell say he want a divorce pack up and leave only to come home again we are financially in dire straight because he quit so my anxiety level are high and I look for job for he every day he refuse to look for himself will not make any phone call and skip various interview we have make the decision for I to be a stay at home mom so I also have no job my conundrum though is that nate is incapable of being trust to watch kaya all day so if I get a job she need to go to daycare so now for the past week he just stay in bed like 20 hour a day he is in there now so another part of all this is my frustration with he as a father he have tell I straight up that he do not like being a father nate will not feed her dress she bathe her read to her play with she put she to sleep or babysit for short period if I need to run an errand nothing he will not get up with she in the morning ever it is like he hate she he will be sit on the couch and she will walk up to he and smile and try to engage he and he will not even look at she this is nothing new though even the ect do not help with that so that is where I am at I do not know what to do I do not want kaya to grow up think it is okay for a man to treat she the way I am being treat but at the same time I do not want to abandon a man who is so obviouslly mentally ill at what point should I put myself before he is there anything I can do to try to get he back to the man I know is it time to move on I am just so tired,very negative,very negative

copd is associate with several comorbiditie traditionally comorbidity is define as a disease coexist with the primary disease of interest in copd this definition is slightly problematic since certain coexist illness may be a consequence or may present a causal association with copd the most common comorbiditie describe in association with copd are hypertension diabetes heart failure ischaemic heart disease cancer osteoporosis depression and anemia copd comorbiditie should be consider when estimate the social and economic burden of the disease these comorbid disease clearly affect health outcome in copd in fact copd patient are think to mainly die of non respiratory disorder such as cancer or cardiovascular disease although it is difficult to determine the underlying cause of death among patient with multiple disease especially when a common risk factor such as tobacco use is involve in arecent study it was show that in copd patient treat with long term oxygen therapy comorbiditie were one of the predictor of all cause and respiratory mortality moreover comorbiditie are associate with a high risk of hospitalization and are one of the strong predictor of increase cost in copd clinical practice guideline seem to ignore the fact that most patient with copd quite often have additional comorbiditie the increase recognition of the role of comorbiditie in copd have make all cause mortality a paramount end point for the evaluation of novel therapy the two recently publish large copd trial torch towards a revolution in copd health and uplift understand the potential long term impact on function with tiotropium are example of how copd study have change because of comorbiditie a recent evaluation of the usa national hospital discharge survey analyze more than 47 million hospital discharge for copd that occur in the usa from 1979 to 2001 in adult great than 25 year of age the prevalence and in hospital mortality were great in hospital discharge with copd mention as a primary or secondary diagnosis versus those that do not mention copd specifically a high rate of in hospital mortality for pneumonia hypertension heart failure and thoracic malignancy was associate with a hospital diagnosis of copd copd is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease strong epidemiological evidence point to reduce fev1 as a marker for cardiovascular mortality in a longitudinal population base study include patient from the nhane I it was show that patient with poor lung function have the high risk of cardiovascular mortality10 this association of decrease lung function and increase cardiovascular mortality is far support by other study such as the copenhagen city heartstudy the underlie mechanism link copd to atherosclerosis ischemic heart disease and stroke are not fully elucidated persistent systemic low grade inflammation is believe to be one of the central event lead to plaque formation under normal condition the human endothelium do not support leukocyte adhesion which is the building block of plaque genesis however in an inflammatory state such as copd the endothelium overexpresse surface adhesion molecule that allow circulate white blood cell to adhere to damage endothelial surface and accordingly trigger inflammatory reaction exaggerated subclinical atherosclerosis have been find in smoker with airflow obstruction compare to control smoker and control non smoker without airflow obstruction impair vascular reactivity is an important factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and endothelial function seem to be significantly impair in patient with stable copd it have been show that arterial wall stiffness which relate to cardiovascular risk is increase in patient with copd compare to smoking control subject and healthy subject these finding suggest that copd may result in endothelial dysfunction which may be a mechanism for the enhanced cardiovascular risk in copd moreover in another study systemic arterial wall stiffness was associate with emphysema as assess by ct scan moreover in a recent study in a greek cohort of copd patient without cardiovascular comorbiditie the presence of emphysema in highresolution ct scan was relate to increase systemic oxidative stress and fibrinogen these finding indicate that mechanism involve in airway wall destruction and emphysema may also produce increase cardiovascular risk in patient with copd mortality due to copd continue to rise whereas mortality relate to cardiovascular disease appear to decline this is partly due to the widespread use of preventive therapy that have been show to reduce cardiovascular mortality accordingly a question arise whether appropriate use of such therapy could have a similar impact on copd mortality statin therapy may provide a new therapeutic option in copd statin which are mainly use as lipid lower agent for treatment of metabolic syndrome have been show to exert both local lung and systemic anti inflammatory and antioxidant effect statin treatment was associate with a slow rate of decline in fev1 in elderly subject this was support by further retrospective study use large database that have show an effect of statin on mortality of copd patient randomize control clinical trial are clearly warrant to assess whether these finding can be confirm prospectively thus provide a new treatment for these patient similarly drug use to treat respiratory disease could have beneficial effect in cardiovascular disease an intriguing finding raise from a post hoc analysis of the european respiratory society study on copd euroscop was that long term inhale corticosteroid ic although not effective in reduce the long term rate of decline in fev1 they lower the incidence of ischemic cardiac event in patient with mild copd this finding was far support by other retrospective database study clearly show that ic may reduce systemic inflammation in patient with copd there is a clear link between copd and lung cancer independently of active smoking there is grow evidence that chronic inflammation may play a salient role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer at the molecular level activation of nuclear factor nf kb transcription factor may have major relevance for both cancer and copd there are study suggest that nf kb activation in the airway of copd patient cause chronic inflammation and increase the risk of lung tumour development an analysis of 22 year follow up datum from 5402 participant from the first national health and nutrition examination survey nhane I include a total of 113 case of lung cancer reveal an inverse correlation between lung cancer risk and the degree of airflow obstruction copd is also associate with osteoporosis in up to 70 of patient and is relate to several underlying mechanism include malnutrition sedentary life smoke steroid treatment and systemic inflammation the prevalence of osteoporosis is increase in more severe disease and both osteoporosis and osteopenia are invariably present in patient with low body mass index and fat free mass moreover copd have been recently recognize as an independent risk factor for the identification of osteoporosis in man anemia have been show to be an independent risk factor for reduce functional capacity and increase mortality in copd in a retrospective analysis of hemoglobin level in a cohort of 683 copd patient anemia was present in 70 of patient and polycythemia in 6 depression represent another frequent comorbidity in copd patient especially due to the fact that they often face major physical impairment and chronic dyspnea patient with severe disease are in even great risk of develop depression the treatment of depression in copd patient is important as it far diminish the functional performance of individual patient and is associate with impaired quality of life massive evidence suggest that clinical feature of copd and airflow limitation are poorly correlate so that a more comprehensive approach is need it is clear that prognostic tool that well capture comorbiditie demonstrate superior performance that do fev1 alone the bode index body mass index airflow obstruction dyspnoea and exercise capacity is a multidimensional instrument that was find to predict prognosis of copd patient well than fev1 in fact the bode index was more effective in predict copd all cause and respiratory mortality than fev1 alone this indicate that it is important to evaluate globally each individual patient when assess copd prognosis beyond the goldstandard fev1 measurement this global assessment definitely include comorbiditie since they may well interfere in the vicious circle of dyspnea and impaired exercise capacity of copd patient the causal relationship of copd and several comorbiditie is not clear do comorbiditie make patient more susceptible to the consequence of copd do copd increase their susceptibility to these comorbiditie or is it a combination of both definitely more work is need to establish the potential mechanism and causal pathway that link comorbiditie and copd,neutral,neutral

the essential anti oxidant for detox the liver glutathione supplementation is not the answer it is expensive and do not make it to the liver it gets destroy before it get there what we need to take are food and supplement that increase glutathione level in the body the good news is that your body produce its own glutathione the bad news is that poor diet pollution toxin medication stress trauma age hep c and other viral bacterial and fungal infection and radiation all deplete your glutathione glutathione is a very simple molecule that is produce naturally all the time in your body it is a combination of three simple building block of protein or amino acid cysteine glycine and glutamine glutathione is critical in help your immune system do its job of fight infection and prevent cancer it is also helpful in ease the pain of arthritis along with selenium and vitamin c eat food that support glutathione production this would include cruciferous vegetable broccoli cauliflower brussels sprouts cabbage radishe kohlrabi mustard green kale collard green turnip rutabagas watercress and horseradish also garlic and onion turmeric cinnamon and cardamom spinach tomatoe pea and rice bran avocado peach and watermelon are also report to raise glutathione level asparagus avocado raw great of all time milk and walnut are rich source of glutathione this one website say that real hellmana s mayonnaise also provide 660 mg of ala per 1 tablespoon I am think it is the raw egg which is also a supporter of glutathione production as well as fresh unprocessed meat sushi anyone steak tartare I would not touch meat unless it was organic grass fed beef organic chicken or wild catch salmon I add organic raw egg to my smoothie for awhile but there are gentle way to increase glutathione production in the body information about cruciferous veggie and their health benefit http www dailystrength org group alternative treatment for hep c news view 1738419 supplement would include nac ala either or both depend on your budget I choose ala I use to take both dr burkson who do the mushroom poisoning testing in new mexico find that when ala was use with milk thistle liver damage from hep c was reverse and liver enzyme level return to normal ala protect the liver regenerate liver tissue reduce risk of liver cancer reduce joint inflammation enhance mental memory and clarity stimulate the immune system and enhance energy level ala have show remarkable effect in help diabetic patient by normalize blood sugar level it increase glucose uptake by muscle cell lead to more energy and stimulate muscle recover and tone it also protect the nerve network of the body ease nerve pain and can restore damage nerve ala for chronic hep c take 300 mg twice daily I take 600 once daily cheap that way nac increase glutathione level help prevent cancer is also anti viral support the immune system protect the liver the dosage for nac is about 3 time the high dose of ala 500 600 mg 3x daily with food take with 1000 3000 mg c 50 mg zinc and 200 mcg selenium for good result also take your b vitamin c e selenium and silymarin milk thistle extract but no pun intend the good way to increase glutathione in the liver is with coffee enema it increase the level 6 7 time how to do a coffee enema get some really good therapeutic roast very light roast organic coffee bean I get mine from cafemam http cafemam com store choose the regular under caffiene choose therapy roast under roast if you do not have a really good grinder choose therapy grind under grind choose whole bean if you can grind it yourself cheap little 20 grinder are not go to last long grind these superb quality bean I use a family grain mill I also use it to grind brown rice for my dog meal it also grind oat into flour and there is another attachment that flake oats so much well fresh for sure the recipe put some filter water into a saucepan with a tight lid about 2 cup you ll measure it later when you add cold water or that is to cool it down add 4 t ground coffee bean bring to a boil boil for 3 minute I turn it down to a low boil and since the stove is electric I turn it down to simmer after 2 minute so it is ready for the lid put the lid on and let it simmer for 15 minute strain into a coffee carafe or other glass jar at least a quart size add filter water and that is cube to cool it and to make a quart I also add a few drop of liquid mineral since enemas tend to take mineral out of your body the therapy I use a fleet enema bottle nice and small and easy to keep clean and to replace those big red enema bag come from china and are hard to clean you can buy an enema bucket if you feel like it I prefer the fleet it is easy to hold 4 oz of liquid lube the tip with a good oil and insert you can lay down assume the knee and chest down position or just bend over at the waist roll the bottle as it empty like roll the tube of toothpaste hold for 12 minute and release repeat until the coffee is all use up after the first insertion and empty if you re in a hurry you can put a couple of bottle in at once as the first time will empty the colon and make room for more that is about it rinse the bottle out when you re do and the tip and let they dry for the next time do not leave coffee in the bottle if you re concerned as I am about plastic leaching fill it and use the content right away there will be a little left in the bottom of the bottle not a big deal for I but you can take the lid off and let air in and empty it all the way or you can leave enough air at the top when you fill the bottle to get all the coffee out the first time and if you eat the food take the supps and do the coffee think how much help you ll be give your liver no but about it laugh out loud oh almost forgot exercise also increase glutathione production to your health and the good source to boost glutathione level is all of the above,neutral,neutral

below is the journey of a little 4 year old girl name abigail I have never meet abigail personally but I know her dad and her good friend emily emily live on my street and emilys dad do some painting in our home a little over a year ago they were a struggle christian family at that time as it was hard for he to find contracting work in the small community we live in not too long after that I have learn from his friend in the neighborhood that they have move north and that he was now a border patrol inspector this past january there was a prayer request at church for a family who have a little girl name abigail that have been emergency medevace out by helicopter to have a blood transfusion several hundred mile away and that they have just learn that she have leukemia I ask the person if it was the same family it was since they begin their 2 3 year medical treatment they have a join the caringbridge org website and have start a log about their journey so that friend family and prayer partner can keep abr of their experience I have select a few excerpt from the entry because even though it do not pertain to estrangement it do certainly speak volume of how other christian do have their heartbreaking trial that are just as painful and just as challenging as their situation is recently I was read how some here have reach the point of give up because the struggle just seem to be too hard to keep go on I know from personal experience just what they are go through because I was there too for I in order for I not to fall back into that pit of despair I depend on god bring I people like the following to help I to feel so much love and gratitude to and for our lord precious wisdom just recently there was a topic about unanswered prayer this familys amazing story of strength and courage in the face of adversity is just what god lead I to in order to tell I that he have been there all along in my own situation and that good do come from adversity it also speak of how sometimes seemingly unanswered prayer is really answer prayer after all and sometime not the way that we think is good for we _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ january 19 2013 I was over come with emotion the other day when it dawn on I just what an all know all powerful god we have I still deeply mourn the loss of our son michael his due date would have been feb 9 2013 all along I have been think that the timing would be perfect and then for god to take he home to heaven you question why I am not angry or bitter but sometimes you just need answer sometimes god give they and sometimes not he give I the answer to my question why he know that this situation with abigail was go to take place he know that she would need I for I to have have a new bear baby just a few week after find out abigail have leukemia and have to go through all that she have to he know tear january 26 2013 yesterday abigail was discharge from the hospital after the three hour drive we get back to our house close to 10 pm the kid were exhaust after a long day esp for abigail who have have procedure do that day as well as a chemo treatment well when we get there we quickly realize that the furnace have stop work the house was fill with smoke and the pipe freeze so those that know I well know that yes I just laugh it was either that or cry I mean seriously our precious daughter was just diagnose with leukemia have been through so much this past week and now this we make several phone call include one to our pastor I ask if he know of a place we could just crash for the night he graciously put we up in a local hotel for the night michaels port director come by offer her support and help the kid and I get settle in the hotel while michael stay at the house work with the specialist before we even go to bed last night a family from the church which have a home they were not use offer it to we to stay until we get thing straighten out is god faithful or what the song I am a friend of god come to my head this morning I am so glad I can call he my friend god is so good february 5 2013 a handful of hair I have always enjoy brushing and do abigail hair but recently it is been bittersweet with each pass day more and more hair come out not just a few piece but by the time I am do brush her hair the entire brush is full of hair it is hard see she lose her hair it is hard to see she double over in pain due to constipation because of medication it is hard watch she walk up the stair and struggle to get to the top because in her word it is just so hard am I bitter no frustrated irritated question why yes sometimes but not bitter and this is why I have been there do that in the past bitterness is something that I have struggle with if I tell you the circumstance why I was bitter you d probably understand and might even agree with I it was not until a crisis point that I realize how bitter I really was and if I have not have a high power to help I I would not have been able to conquer it it was so deep that humanly it was impossible to gain victory over when I come to the realization of it my daily prayer to the lord the high power was god please take this bitterness away from I short simple and to the point it was not an overnight turn around it take a lot of effort on my part and a lot patience on god part but between the two of we we manage to get it under control during this process I come across this quote it say bitterness is like swallow poison and expect the other person to die from it hmmm I think that is pretty good I read it again bitterness is like swallow poison and expect the other person to die from it wow wow that is really good I think how true is that whether you re bitter at a situation a person or even god who is it hurt is it hurt the situation individual or god no it is only hurt you yourself and those around you probably the one you love most I am sure everyone have at least once experience being around a bitter person you walk away exhausted and maybe even a little depressed yourself so to answer the question that some have ask no I am not bitter and with god help I will not allow bitterness back into my life will I have bad day deal with this situation of course but life is too short to allow another minute of bitterness back in I can not even imagine what kind of mother I would be to abigail right now if I was still bitter she need the good right now and that is what I am go to give her http www caringbridge org visit abigailjohnston mystory _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ to I it is not that they have horrendous struggle right now we all do it is how this family respond to it that is so humble to

hello everyone I sign up as a member here a few month ago but never really post I always have been more of a reader than writer pretty much any question or concern I ever have I could find info for and I have get so much help just read but I have come to a point that I sure could use a little more personal encouragement understanding and lot and lot of prayer here is a brief I hope summary of my past 10 month I was diagnose with aml august 4 2015 I was 65 at the time now 66 my health record show diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia with presence of erythroid hyperplasia 25 blast of all non erythroid cell normal female karyotype aml fish panel is negative molecular test show positive cebpa negative npm1 and flt3 I was tell that I fall into the intermediate range some good marker and some not so good I receive the 7 3 protocol of cytarabine and idarubicin for induction and except for body rash from allergy to one of the med and mouth and throat problem I do very well do not really feel sick and never vomitte I was only in the hospital for 17 day because I do so well my blood count bounce back within 3 week then I go back to the hospital for 5 day to start the first cycle of consolidation I have a total of 4 consolidation which end 1 11 2016 and I handle they with no real problem to speak of thank god a possible bmt sct was mention by my doctor pretty early on she want I to go to scca seattle cancer care alliance for a consultation but at that time I decline and tell she I do not want a transplant just chemo only pray all the time that I would not relapse even though I have been feel so great these past month and all throughout my treatment with just being a little tired between chemos when my count go down and feel so positive strong well than I have feel in year even year before diagnosis ready to climb a mountain this summer when we go camp I recently get the news that I relapse they find a few blast in my peripheral blood and after a biopsy they find 1 to 2 blast in my bone marrow I know could still be consider remission if under 5 but the doctor say no doubt of relapse and they go by last chemo for count remission in january so that just make I in remission for 3 month which is not good for salvage chemo alone so I finally agree to go to scca for a consultation and here are my 3 choice 1 I can do nothing more and have approximately 1 year nobody but god really know 2 I can do salvage chemo only which they give I a 15 chance of long remission 3 I can do chemo tbi and a transplant lot of protocol to choose from here give I a 35 to 40 chance of long remission I have almost decide on transplant the tbi and gvhd and all the risk are weigh heavily on my mind I have such good quality of life at this point I sure hate to loose it possibly for good in a way I would like to just try the salvage chemo alone have it do at the seattle cancer center since they have access to the late and great drug that are still in the process of being approve by the fda but they are able to use they and they are have very good success with I could be one of the 15 to make it to long remission but if I do that my chance go down if I relapse again and I am not sure a transplant would be in the picture then if I was much young I would go straight to transplant but at my age I really do not know what s good for I I know none of you can tell I what to do this is my choice alone I am just look for encouragement and prayer and whatever I decide in the near future to have a place to go where people understand what I am go through nobody can know unless they have been through it I know this is long and thank you to whoever read it it actually help to write it out I would welcome your thought good wish and prayer to everyone karen,positive,positive

my doctor find a 4 cm polyp in my cecum during a routine colonoscopy I was shocked because I think I was the pillar of health and there were no symptom he say it look benign but he could not tell for sure and that he would send some biopsy specimen to pathology the pathology report say that they it was a tubulovillous adenoma which mean it was a benign polyp however my doctor say that he still could not be sure that the whole polyp was benign because those specimen were just a small part of the polyp he say that he must remove the polyp totally to see if there were part of cancer in there I was tell that even if it was totally benign it still have to be remove because adenomas over time turn into cancer so now was the search to find a doctor to remove it I go to one surgeon and he say that he would have to remove ten inch of my intestine the lymph nod the polyp and most of the cecum because even though it might be a benign polyp it might be cancerous and he do not want to have to do another surgery I was tell I would be in the hospital for a week to ten day and home for three week and that this surgery was being do with general anesthesia also my stomach would never been the same but I would learn to readjust and eat differently to avoid problem go to the bathroom I go to another surgeon and he basically say the same thing so I research the internet and I find an alternate method which few doctor care to mention I discover that large polyp in the cecum can be remove with a special type of colonoscopy use emr I was tell that the cecum is extremely thin about 2 dime thick and only a handful of very skilled doctor can remove a large polyp with an emr colonoscopy I do my research and I find two renowned doctor from new york city dr haber and dr waye who have the expertise to do this procedure I choose doctor jerome waye to remove my 4 cm polyp I schedule my procedure with dr waye do my prep for this polypectomy walk in on the day schedule and in one hour later walk out feel fine the doctor remove the entire polyp after I have to eat soft food and food with no fiber for 4 day I stay home the next day but probably if I have to could have go to work the following week I call the office and I was tell that my 4 cm polyp in my cecum was not cancerous I promise myself that if I have a positive outcome I would post something on this health board because when I originally find out I have a 4 cm polyp and go online to research it everything everywhere say it was doom and gloom website were give statistic about the size of the polyp in relationship to the possibility of it being cancerous it look to I I could not have escape cancer since it was so large they were wrong also all the blog I read say that after the speciman say it was benign when they totally take it out there was some cancer in it mine have no cancer in it after the entire polyp was remove all the people were blogge that their 4 cm benign polyp turn out to be stage 3 or stage 4 after totally remove it I was cancer free people who have benign polyp specimen still go through major surgery I go the colonoscopy emr route my intestine and colon was not compromise I do not go through major surgery like most doctor recommend and my inside are the same as before so if you just find out you have a large polyp in your cecum and it look benign there is hope it probably will be totally benign have faith because now you know my story also if it is in the cecum you might want to go the emr colonoscopy route I am not a doctor and can not tell you what to do I can only tell you what I do and how my nightmare end on a positive note good luck to you I,positive,positive

I read an interesting thing about bile salt in hepatitis magazine while milk thistle block fibrotic damage bile salt udca cut the elevation of liver enzyme in half in combination therapy with interferon udca halve the relapse rate of those respond the bile salt provide raw material to the liver lower inflammatory buildup the addition of licorice to bile salt also significantly lower ggt inflammatory level but licorice can have significant side effect if something reduce the chance of relapse I want to take it anyone know about this the entire article is below here is the link http www liverhealthtoday org viewarticle cfm aid 202 complementary and alternative medicine for hepatitis patient description if your current treatment plan isna t working find one that will by christopher maloney and d body there are many treatment available to those who suffer from hepatitis but some are more effective while some have more side effect than other the standard therapy include interferon which boost the immune system and ribavirin an antiviral drug add ribavirin to interferon increase the chance of suppress the hepatitis the new long last pegylate interferon have a great effect while thymosin and glucocorticoid steroid have no benefit the standard therapy come with a promise of benefit for up to 60 percent of patient but they also have significant side effect depression autoimmune reaction blood change and infectious disorder may prevent up to 25 percent of patient from continue therapy more importantly patient may not be good candidate for interferon therapy in a german study of hepatitis c patient 73 percent of patient do not meet the criterion for treatment the reality of multiple medical diagnosis make it necessary to find alternative for these patient for many patient there are no standard medical option and patient are leave to wait for the next medical breakthrough or to look for alternative on their own most doctor are able to provide little guidance beyond the standard treatment 3 simple rule once beyond the confine of the hospital a patient is likely to be bombard by supplement and plan that claim everything under the sun consumer therefore should follow three basic rule when consider alternative treatment the first rule is that if an individual is receive money from sell something he or she is unlikely to be a good source of objective information the second rule is that if something is suppose to cure everything it doesna t the third rule is that natural do not mean harmless and if side effect occur a person should discontinue use immediately too often alternative medicine is surround by magical thinking where normal body process are ignore simply because something was pray over or come from a shamanic recipe patient will continue to take it long after it have prove to be ineffective and or is cause significant side effect a physician need to be inform of any experimentation patient who are embarrassed to tell their doctor about experimentation need to realize that their reluctance may be life threaten the safe choice are either to stop experiment or to find a doctor with whom they feel comfortable speak freely doctor familiar with and open to alternative therapy are far more available now than they were even 10 year ago the american association of naturopathic physician and the american holistic medical association are two source of license doctor get milk thistle any alternative treatment for hepatitis should include milk thistle silymarin marianum long term study of alcohol cirrhosis find that take 420 mg of milk thistle daily decrease death rate by 7 percent milk thistle halve the death rate from acute mushroom poisoning and prevent lead poison destruction of the liver animal study show that milk thistle prevent destruction and preserve liver function milk thistle have no antiviral effect and have a side effect picture equivalent to placebo it is nontoxic and can prevent death at a cost far low than standard drug regimen while milk thistle block fibrotic damage bile salt udca cut the elevation of liver enzyme in half in combination therapy with interferon udca halve the relapse rate of those respond the bile salt provide raw material to the liver lower inflammatory buildup the addition of licorice to bile salt also significantly lower ggt inflammatory level but licorice can have significant side effect in 22 randomize trial the plant from the phyllanthus plant family were find to be equivalent to interferon in removal of hepatitis b marker in the blood although no large trial of the plant have been do a huge number of other plant have been show effective against the hepatitis virus in sudanese medicinal plant 34 of 71 plant have antiviral effect against hepatitis c of these eight have a great than 90 percent inhibition no human or animal trial have been do despite the fact that in the sudan standard treatment is unavailable a variety of chinese formulation also are effective in lower hepatitis c marker and both rosemary and tomato have been show to be protective of the liver gingko biloba have antioxidant property and was liver protective in a short term trial it is also a vasodilator that may affect bleed so it should be use under supervision dieta s important within the diet specific change should be institute immediately several study have show that low iron intake diet have been effective in lower inflammatory marker for patient with hepatitis patient in japan have significant inflammatory drop without anemia in india inflammation was halve when iron intake was halve none of these patient have been diagnose with hemochromatosis massive liver iron overload look at the liver function provide a context for the result of medical study the destruction of the liver from hepatitis result from chronic long term inflammation standard medical treatment increase the immune response with interferon while provide support with ribavirin if successful the virus is destroy if unsuccessful standard treatment try the same thing expect different result liver function is not optimize beyond restrict alcohol complementary medicine increase day to day liver function milk thistle provide antioxidant support while block toxin uptake by liver cell bile salt speed the processing of the liver and decrease its need to create bile salt rosemary and a host of other herb provide antiviral support but add supplement without remove other impact on the liver is like put finger in a dike maximize liver function involve the idea of a liver load at a give time the liver can process only so much material within standard medicine we see the overload of the liver as drug side effect and the occasional drug or alcohol overdose but like an overwork office worker the liver experience various level of load long before it quit daily living place a tremendous strain on the liver which process everything we eat it must take care of last weekenda s buffet in addition to the constant sleep deprivation and stress hormone add a chronic virus and the necessity for rest and repair in a frantic world and you have a recipe for fibrosis a constant routine eat a very healthy diet and minimize unnecessary drug and supplement intake include vitamin megadose will go a long way in preserve liver function one of the effect of decrease liver function is call hepatic encephalopathy the backup of unprocessed body toxin include ammonia affect brain function increase bowel clearance which remove process toxin excrete by the liver and gall bladder from the body have been show to be effective in decrease symptom another therapy is decrease protein intake do under a doctora s supervision the use of probiotic good intestinal bacteria may also be helpful in minimize liver load prior to experience brain symptom it would be wise to treat the body like it have a chronic viral infection patient are familiar with viral infection in the shape of cold or flus and may forget that the viral response of the body to a liver virus is similar rather than wait for interferon to boost the immune system simple treatment hot pack over the liver avoidance of sweet plenty of fluid and so on will certainly not harm and will help prevent other illness while there are no study on garlic and hepatitis garlic is twice as effective as drug antiviral against the flu and also act as a broad spectrum antibiotic patient take garlic capsule have half as many flus and the flu symptom last half as long in treat viral load one should look at the body as a whole rather than fixate on the liver load alone money matter chronic disease is a great drain on financial resource individual too ill to work may be unable to support themselves add that tremendous stress to the viral illness after exhaust standard treatment an individual might partner with a doctor to treat themselves for a chronic viral illness a possible treatment plan require no extra money would include eat brown grain very good quality oil nut and seed and a rainbow of fruit and vegetable a patient could learn to do lymphatic drainage massage and stretch exercise include tai chi or yoga liver processing could be maximize by regular small meal more bitter taste food which stimulate bile excretion and by gentle massage of the liver and abdoman or hot and cold pack over the area strong smell household spice include rosemary would be use freely an individual without a lot of money would be wise to research any supplement prior to purchase product with independent laboratory testing are available to all naturopathic physician any product purchase should be put through an individual objective trial for symptom resolution and lowering of liver inflammatory level three month would be the maximum trial with improvement often see within day milk thistle and bile salt would be high on my list of possible choice which also would include the phyllanthus plant family from reputable eastern importer the bottom line if your current treatment plan is not work for you find one that will,neutral,neutral

first I want to preface this message by say I believe everyone should see a doctor if they see any suspicious symptom every situation is unique and just because I have good news to report do not mean that the same exact symptom would not mean a more serious problem exist the reason I am write I even register just to post this message is because a lot of people post question comment relate to flat stool in fact a google search on flat stool seem to lead to this board more than anywhere else of course someone with flat stool will be frighten out of their wit well I am here to report that I am a 32 yr old that have experience flat stool for the first time in my life in the last 6 9 month and I just have a full colonoscopy and I have nothing more than small internal hemorroid when I finally muster the courage to see my doctor and get the gi referral I was inform by the gi that I seem in perfectly good health but a colonoscopy would be good just to make sure I am a total wuss and have never been put under even though it was not technically general anesthesia it still scare I because of the iv and that was no big deal at all in the end the procedure was easy as pie the sedation process was very very comfortable not sudden like being put into a deep comfortable sleep and you wake up feel well rest not remember a thing I highly highly recommend anyone with flatten stool to get it check out the bad case scenario is that you will get a colonoscopy and it really was a painless procedure you ll feel so much well know everything is ok and if they do find something you are much well off know when your only syptom is a change in bowel habit and not more progress symptom when it will be hard to cure you,neutral,neutral

to do a bone marrow transplant the transplant involve a course of intense chemotherapy destroy nearly every cell of bone marrow before the stem cell could restart the system at a certain point all of your blood count crash and then they just wipe out your immune system it s like they throw you off a boat into the water you sit there and start to sink and then they throw you the life preserver that

because of my weak heart due to the chemo drug adriamycin they couldn t treat I as aggressively as they might have someone healthy I really think when the doctor tell I that I have leukemia that he was basically tell I that I was go to die three long year of chemotherapy follow most day were pretty long and I was pretty sick and there was a lot of pain involve so what I try to do was just focus on try to have a good half an hour every day then I could use that to get I to the next day that half hour could be a friend come by to talk baseball each morning when I would wake up I would try to figure out where I could find those thirty minute it was really about the people in my life I really enjoy my time with they and I wasn t ready to quit at that point I have think a lot about my own
