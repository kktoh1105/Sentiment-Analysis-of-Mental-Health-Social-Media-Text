"Meltdowns/sensory issues getting worse? Hi I'm a long time lurked but never posted before. I changed anti depressants about 5 times this year and since then nothings been working to keep my mental health in check and that's declining again, I'm also being tested for seizures.

Could this be why meltdowns and sensory problems are getting worse and more common? Most the time I can't even give my partner a hug because I just freak out, but they're the only person I've ever been able to be physically close to before. Every time a neighbour's kid screams while they're playing I have to cover my ears and hide because it irritates me, I cant go out from around 10am-4pm bc it's too bright for me.

"Book recommendations about autism so I can understand my friend better Hello!
My best friend is autistic. I’d like to understand them better but since they have a hard time wording the things that happen in their head sometimes, I’d like to read about it to be able to create a safer and more comfortable environment for them. 

I know there are a lot of books but I feel like most of them show autism under a very negative light or are targeted for parents with autistic kids so I thought that maybe I could get some good recommendations from you.

"Ah yes, as if I didn’t feel invalid enough my lovely coworker really had to get into the “ privilege” of having an eating disorrder I work at a supplement shop. My coworkers are really close and we usually end up talking about ED’s Because (shocker) most people drawn to a job like this have had one.

I used to be anorexic, than bulimic, than sort of recovered and now I’m what I think is ortho/bulimic but I haven’t been diagnosed as that.  I replaced this summer and lost a good 20lbs on my already small frame. I’m trying so hard to recover though and just be healthy

So ANYWAY I have this coworker well call Jessica. She’s for sure the one upper type. She’s also (sort of related) very overweight. 

So me and another coworker are just talking about fad diets that people come into the shop all the time for. It breaks my heart selling these things to people and we got to talking about eating disorders.

Like I said, this has been a rough summer for me. I lost *20 fucking lbs* 

When Jessica HAS to chime in about how skinny whites people don’t really have anything to worry about at all. That people who are like her, are the one people who can have problems with food and that skinny people (which for the record I’m not skin and bones here Ive got some fat on me still) are actually just being dramatic and have nothing to worry about! They get treated 100x better and their lives are on easy mode! Yay! They’re just being brats!! in fact they’re actually privileged as fuck and don’t notice! 

Like shut the fuck up sorry you’re also in pain, but you’re in the same boat as me when it comes to societal pressures making you hate yourself. Maybe she does have BED or something. Idk? I don’t care actually, that’s fucked to say to someone who’s literally talking about their Ed in front of you and you’ve visibly seen falling into it??? the last thing I fucking needed was for someone to tell me that I’m being a winy baby and that my ed isn’t real and im being ungrateful.

"Am i an alcoholic? (20yo) For the past two years i've been drinking every week atleast two days in row. But now for like three months i've been drinking usually 3-4days a week and always sleeping on the floor or just being really drunk (once i peed myself while black out walking to my living room) 

last week i had four days  of hard drinking and sunday it was from morning to the night. When i woke up on monday, i had bad panic attacks and i almost fainted while sitting on the side of my bed head leaning on my hands, i had cold and warm rushes, shivers, i felt anxiety and paranoid that i was actually going to die and i just spend whole day on bed skipping work. Everytime i went to get watee i felt dizzy (even on the bed it felt like the ground was moving down beneath me) 

Told myself ""jesus, i aint gonna drink anymore"".... next day after work i was drunk and the day after that i skipped work.

"Update On My Life (If anyone cares to know) I'm taking my medication(risperidone) religiously but my auditory hallucinations and paranoia still persist. I'm convinced the helper we have at home is spying on me. She talks about me behind my back to my sister and always seems to watch me whenever she thinks I'm not aware. My extended family acts nice but deep down I can't relate to them nor trust them. I had a breakdown while staying with them and they just chalked it up to me being high and told me I'm a disappointment to my father and the next time I have a breakdown they'll beat me. I've since blocked all of them and ignore them. 

I still feel guilty for being toxic towards my friend. She told me that we would tear each other apart  (she's bipolar 2) as a result and broke up with me and quickly moved on to someone else. I was hurt but I understand and I told her I would distance myself from her and haven't spoken to her since and only plan to on the 15th when she starts her second semester just wish her luck with academic endeavours and leave it at that. She did call me twice a 3 days ago but sent a message saying she called by mistake. I don't really know what to make of that. I just feel so guilty for being bad towards her and that for a brief moment I became my father. ( He was emotionally abusive and possibly suffered by mental illness himself. He died in 2012 so I'll never really know.)

I've been applying for universities despite the financial situation of my country and family getting bleaker by the day and hopefully I'll get acceptance letters but I'm not expecting much. 

I just feel so alone, empty and hollow. Everyone tells to go out and make friends but I feel like I can't relate to most of my generation. (I'm 23). I know I can be a lot and that I can drag people down and deep down I wish things could be better but I'm getting used to the isolation and feel more comfortable being alone with myself and my writings.

"When your SO hates your ADHD Has anyone else had relationship issues due to their ADHD?

I recently came out of a relationship where it was a real problem. My SO **HATED** it. She didn't act like it was a real thing. She treated my behaviors like I was ""doing it on purpose"" and to ""just pay attention"".

She would berate me for missing things, for getting distracted, and would say that there is something wrong with me.

She would often suggest that I go on medication.

Problem is, I like myself just the way I am. I don't have any issues with how I function, and I make my way through life just fine. I have a good job, I pay my bills, I have two great dogs, I have some friends who seem to like me.

"I need help Today I woke up at home and started remembering the night before. For the first time in my life i went out alone because none of my friends were up to going out on a tuesday. I got extremely drunk and behaved accordinly. I can remember that i wanted to go home from the last bar i was at. After that i remember that i sort of ”woke up” very far from my actual home and hitched a ride to the nearest train station. I have no idea how i ended up there at 6 in the morning. All i remember is coming home. I feel extremely low, scared and embarrased of my own behaviour. What scares me the most is not remembering how or why i went so far from my home and that i let myself get to this state. What happened over there i will never know.

The reason i’m posting this is that i need someone to hear me and tell me that i’ll be ok. I need someone to encourage me to completely stop drinking so i don’t endanger myself like this ever again.

"7 weeks in I thought I might post a little more since I was diagnosed about 7 weeks ago, but I have been working on some things and wanted to relate my experiences so far.

I was on Zoloft until Sunday when I switched to Prozac. I saw the psychiatric nurse on Friday and I related to her that I was having certain negative words (Kill and death) popping into my head, usually when I woke up during the night. I was also having a hard time ejaculating during sex, so she prescribed the Prozac. I tapered the Zoloft, taking 1/2 a pill on Friday and Saturday when things took turn for the worse. Without any details I went berserk on an employee at the trampoline park my son goes to and nearly got myself thrown out. My wife is an amazing person and she helped me have a great evening despite me kicking myself for hours after.

I didn’t feel like the Prozac was working after 3 doses so I contacted my nurse practitioner and asked me to evaluate my symptoms. I wasn’t terrible, still much better than when I first started meds. We agreed that continuing the Prozac and keeping a close eye on my symptoms was the right thing.

I am a medical cannabis patient for several back issues and have had chronic pain for several years.  With all the rain we’ve gotten lately, my back has been a mess so I hit the shatter (82+% THC) very hard last night. Then things went downhill faster than I ever imagined. I got up from lying in bed watching TV and I was restless,  I noticed my hands were clenched and my thumb was twitching. Then I started feeling the anxiety, so I laid back down and got under the covers. I looked up at the ceiling and realized it was coming down on me. I asked my wife if it was coming down and she got concerned, asking me what was wrong. I told her what was happening and she wanted to call 911. I said no because I knew the once the THC started wearing off I would be ok.

Then things got even worse. I could no longer have any part of my body outside the covers and ended up with just my eyes peeking over. I had my hands over each side of my head and I wanted to scream very loud. I was absolutely sure I was going to die any minute and told my wife. She was getting alarmed and again wanted to call 911. I again talked her out of it and just asked her to hold me which she did and I felt a little better. I eventually was so exhausted I fell asleep and woke up fine this morning.

To cut this long story short, from now on I will keep a very close watch on my cannabis consumption now that I am medication for depression and PTSD.

"I embarrassed myself last night, once again. Lately I've had many things on my mind and it hasn't been easy. The only way I know how to cope with things is - drinking.

This resulted with, of course, me embarrassing myself in front of my friends. I said and did some things I am not proud of.

"Guilt about not serving Hello, I just joined this group after a particularly rough morning. I don’t really know how to start so I’ll start with my background. 

I was abused as a child. I was isolated and given no choices. I knew this wasn’t normal but I didn’t have any resources or people who knew or could help me when I was little. In high school I became closer with a family friend who was a cop and a war veteran. He saved me from my household and provided a safe place and someone to talk to. At this point I didn’t know I had PTSD and didn’t know until last October. This man was my hero. I know the horrors of what he went through in Korea and stateside as a cop. 

In October I was in a car accident that left me with post concussion syndrome (PCS) and PTSD on top of a few other pre-existing things like depression and OCD. I’ve really been struggling and have been going to therapy since the accident. I was diagnosed with PTSD, but I feel so guilty for having it when what I went through doesn’t compare to serving in a war. I know some of what my mentor went through and my trauma does not compare to his or any of my other friends who have served. 

I’m so angry all the time, like I’m always ready to fight.   Little things set me off. I don’t want to do anything except stay at home. I feel like I don’t have a right to be feeling like this when I haven’t served, and it makes it worse. Has anyone else felt this way and does anyone have any advice?",ptsd,ptsd

"lack of positive emotion Ever since I developed PTSD years ago, it's like i'm less and less capable of feeling anything remotely positive.

When people say that they love me, it stirs nothing in my soul even if i'm close to that person. My flashbacks and anxiety aren't nearly as bad as they use to be, not so frequent, but emotionally, I seem to be getting worse. Nothing ever feels worth doing because there is no reward for it, no positive hormone dump like healthy people would get even if I do accomplish something. It is killing me and has killed my motivation immensely. This problem has made me a very unlikeable person because i'm not fun to be around anymore, especially since I don't drink heavy anymore which is basically expected if you want to have any social relationships in western society.

"Are these delusions I should be concerned about? So for my entire life I have things that could be delusions. I am bipolar but a lot of this doesn’t really seem immediately related to that. How concerning is this? 


When I was six I believed that the guy who build my house was a bad doctor who had died in the house and was haunting it. One time I went into a closet and paper towels fell on me and I thought it was the doctor throwing them at me. Another time when I stayed up late on New Years I saw a white mist on the shape of a person walk down the stairs and down the hall, which I believed to be the doctor. 


When I was eight I fake confessed my sins at church and everyone praised me thinking I actually confessed. I felt super guilty and thought that God was super angry with me and was going to punish me and my family. I stayed up several nights after that crying and apologizing to God. Also for a while after that I constantly felt Gods presence and like someone was watching me but that person was God. 


When I was ten I watched a show called “I Shouldn’t be Alive” where people tell their story of being trapped in the wilderness. In one episode these people are trapped on a raft and one guy drinks seawater and goes crazy and jumps into the water and gets eaten by sharks. I believed that the ghost of that guy was haunting me and was mad at me for watching the show which disrespected his memory. 


Also some time around this time I hallucinated the sensation of a giant millipede squirming in my bed. I also thought that I may have some small power of prophecy, somewhat as a joke, idk how much I actually believed this but more than none. 


When I was twelve I watched The Truman Show and did not immediately realize that it was fiction. My dad quickly told me that it was, but I was still afraid after that that there were cameras hidden around the house or in the mirrors. I tried to act very normal in front of the mirror incase anyone was watching. 


When I was sixteen I accidentally saw a photo of a dead girl (a dead decomposing body) on the Internet. Putting that picture on the internet seemed like an extremely disrespectful thing to do to the girl since the way she died was far from flattering. Similar to the “I Shouldn’t be alive” incident I had the feeling that her ghost was haunting me for disrespecting her by seeing the image. I didn’t fully believe  this was true I just had the creepy feeling of it. 


I also have had a couple incidents w hallucinations, audio, visual, along with smells. This seemed to be a bipolar mixed episode which gave me the hallucinations. I was on an antipsychotic for a while and it seems to have gone away, even since I’ve stopped. 


I also get really paranoid when I have panic attacks, like believing that my parents are planning to lock me up, or that my mom hates me so much I have to hide from her.

"I think my brother's kid might be on the spectrum  

So, my brother has a kid, he's 12 and kind of a spoiled brat. I love him because he's my nephew, but i don't want to babysit him. I'll get into why.

Last weekend, my brother had to do Christmas shopping, so he sent him to stay with me for the night. He had to wrap gifts and his son was always snooping.

I have never babysat him before, or really spend long preriods of time with him. But He was absolutely unruly. I had housework to do and everything and he kept bugging me, about wanting to go out to eat. I tried to fix him something at my house but he made fun of my cooking, he spit it out and fed it to the cat. He screamed at me for 20 minutes to take him out to eat. My son had enough and just begged me to ""Take him to dinner, he's not gonna shut up until he gets what he wants"".

So, i did. I just gave in. But he wouldn't tell me where he wanted to eat at. I drove past all these restaurants, but nothing interested him. So i begged him to tell me where he wanted to eat at, he eventually just blurted out this restaurant that's really expensive, i tried to tell him otherwise and we could go to a McDonald's or something, but he started kicking the floor of my car, screaming that he wanted food from this place. I got him his food, he ordered over 10 dollars worth of crap and when we sit down to eat, he eats about half of it and then complains that he ordered the wrong one. He wanted the spicy flavored food, not the regular. So, he threw another tantrum in the store, and i got it for him. He ate some of that, but threw the rest away.

Before we left, i bought something for my kids and on the way home. He ate 10 bucks worth of food, and when i look in the backseat, he's done chowed down on the food i bought for my kids too. So, we passed a Gamestop on the way home, and he asked me to stop. I said no and he threw another tantrum, i stood my ground but then he started throwing stuff out the window. I just did it, i had enough. I went to gamestop. But, evidently that was wrong too. He wanted a game called Battlefield, but they didn't have it. He started whining about that, even though there were hundreds of video games in that place, nothing there interested him. So, he threw another tantrum, he fell to the floor and started screaming ""I want battlefield!""

So, i went up to the counter and asked ""Please, for the love of God, do you have Battlefield in the back or something?"", they actually did. He got me a copy and i paid for it and we left. On the way out, i bumped into an old friend of mine. I tried talking to them, but he kept pulling my arm, and he even grabbed pebbles off the ground and started throwing them at me.

We got back in the car and he had annother problem. Apparently i got the wrong version of Battlefield, he threw the game on the floor of my car. At this point i had enough, so i took him back to his father. But when i got there, he wasn't even wrapping anything. He was on the couch in his underwear, drinking a glass of wine. He got mad at me because i brought him back early.

The first thing the kid did when he got was take out the battlefield game and show it to his dad. ""Hey dad, look what uncle joe got me! Haha!"" and he went in his room. My brother started yelling at me, he said he couldn't have that game because it was too violent.

"I need help I’m using a throwaway out of shame. I’m a 27 year old SAHM of two, full time student, husband in the military. We’re 2000+ miles from any family and have been for 2 years. I worked until we moved to my husbands current duty station and this was never an issue until now. 

Alcoholism runs heavily in my family. My mom is 4 years sober, sister is 3 years sober, dad was an alcoholic that left us (me, mom and 4 sisters) 26 years ago. Etc etc, on and on. 

I know I’m depressed, I have horrible anxiety. I suffered a miscarriage 2 and a half years ago that really put everything into full swing. 

I’m failing my classes, grumpy with my kids, annoyed with my husband, my house is a mess, you get the idea. 

My day is based on when it’s acceptable to start drinking. I don’t drink and drive with my kids in the car and I don’t get wasted enough to vomit. But I drink a lot. Every day. 

I can’t get help right now. We’re waiting to move out of this horrible place that we’re stationed. We have orders, my getting help would fuck them up. I haven’t even opened up to my husband about feeling like I need help. I don’t want the judgement. 

He knows I have anxiety. He knows I’m depressed. But he agrees that I need to wait until our next station so that we can get out of here. He doesn’t know that I consider myself an alcoholic. 

He was drinking just as much as me up until about 2 months ago. He took up tobacco again and (while also unhealthy) has totally curbed his drinking from it. 

I’m so lost. I want to stop. But I physically feel like I can’t. I need help but need to wait another 5 months. I don’t feel like I have the willpower to just do it on my own. ",alcoholism,alcoholism

"I went out tonight and did not drink, and I don’t think I will ever again. Today something changed. My friend who is visiting called me up to have dinner, I knew he will want to drink and go out after. Normally I start a huge conversation in my head, panicking about having to drink, not wanting to do so because I have too much stuff I want to do, but also wanting to see my friend, also kind of wanting to drink. And I spent hours pondering about what I should do, normally ending with me drinking.

Not today, I didn’t think. I decided to meet up straight away. And did not drink. I said cheers, I had shots and they were all just water. I was part of the night, the action, ate loads of delicious food and didn’t drink a single sip. I loved it. It was so much easier than I expected, so much more fun.
I liked being the sober one, I liked being the one drinking water, I liked being able to have fun, joke around despite not drinking and I am so happy that I will not be suffering from a hangover tomorrow and be pained with guilt.  And I love that connection that automatically happens with all the other sober people around. 

This was so easy, my last excuse to be drinking disappeared. All my socializing always involves alcohol, always. To me, I thought, I just have to change all my friends and habits to be able to stop drinking. But no, I can just simply not drink! 

I really don’t know what happened and how this happened today but I feel like a switch in my brain flicked over. I am so excited for all my upcoming appointments, because I know I will not drink and it makes me feel good and I don’t need to get stressed out because of drinking. I won’t be feeling guilty, I won’t be anxious. But I will also not miss out and still have fun.

"New to the group and wanted to share my recent story. So, no pity party needed. I served USMC for 5 years as a Helicopter Crewchief on the CH53D. I was in Afghanistan 11-12.

I’m lucky enough to live within driving distance of a handful of Marines I served with. One of which physically took me to the VA and got me help. I have my appointments set and they found a medication balance that’s perfect. I’ve been more productive this last month than I have for a couple years.

"I (16,M) have ptsd, but my mother (who also has ptsd) doesn’t want to get me help because she’d have to admit she was neglectful. warning: Wall of words and triggering topics. 

I’m going to start this off by doing some explaining. I was raised in a cult. My father physically and emotionally abused my mother and sister. Later on he emotionally and sexually abused me (not physically, but with the use of pornographic material). When I was about 6 or 7, my sister sexually assaulted me. She also physically abused me from about the age of 4-12 (?). My mother and father divorced when I was 5, my father had a PFA against him, and when I was able to see him again I had unsupervised visits. During these visits my father very much involved me in the sex cult he was part of. My mother was very emotionally neglectful when I was growing up. I was given all the things I needed to survive but none of the things I needed to be stable. When I got older, my sister began abusing the medications she was on. This progressed from pills to heroin and she was put under professional care by my grandfather. My mother avoided this for months upon months and made me be her drug dog. I don’t remember a lot of it but I walked in on my sister passed out from an overdose and my mother never even asked me how I was after she used me to see what my sister was doing. Me and my mother, as you can imagine, have a horrible relationship. I cut my father off a year ago. I’ve seen and heard a lot of scary shit that still takes over my thoughts to this day. 


Now, I’m older. I’m still living with my mother, my sister is on her own and clean, and I am safe from any and all harm. Throughout my entire life I’ve suffered from extreme anxiety, depression, and intrusive thoughts. When I was younger (toddler-elementary school student), many of these thoughts were things like having sex with my mom or feeling like someone was watching me. In middle school, the paranoia of being watched increased and my intrusive thoughts become more serious. I was obsessed with the idea of me killing someone, but had absolutely no desire to actually hurt people. It was terrifying, especially because I look just like my father, to think that I was broken enough to hurt another person. I never ever wanted to do these things, but the image of it happening was always picking at my brain. I also began talking back to the people I thought were watching me and started checking my windows at night. This paranoia started one of my biggest fears/reoccurring thoughts. When I was 15, I became obsessed with the idea of getting murdered. My bed and bodies of water are my biggest triggers. For example, I recently went on vacation to Vermont. I went to a lake to go swimming and as soon as the water hit my toes I felt an overwhelming feeling that I was being watched. I stared at the water for a while, imagining my own dead body floating around, and tried to pretend like everything was okay. I still managed to have a good time, but the imagine of me dead was still in the back of my head the whole time. Every time I imagine myself dead, which is normally a couple times a day, I’m almost completely decomposing. At night I find myself spiraling thinking about it, which drives me to spend hours looking at crime scene photos online. Sometimes looking at these photos is a way to cope, other times (with the more graphic ones), it almost feels like I’m making it worse. I look at videos and images online that make me feel physically sick, but my fingers keep typing away and looking for more disturbing things to look at. I never know how to stop, and almost always feel like I’m in danger or someone is going to kill me. It’s like an overwhelming feeling like this is the moment I’m going to die. It drives me insane not being able to sleep because I feel like there’s cameras in my room or people outside my window. And Lately, ive been unable to cry about it. I just go into these laughing, hyperventilating breakdowns that leave me feeling hopeless. I’ve talked to my mom about all of this, but she just dismisses it like I’m just saying it to get her attention and validation. This only makes it harder for me to want to get help because she always finds a way to convince me that I’m faking it. I don’t know how to prove to her that if I don’t get help soon I know I’m going to kill myself out of fear of someone else doing it first. I’ve already been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD, but ptsd is the only one that’s not on my paperwork because the people that have diagnosed me with it did not have the personal connection with me where they could legally put it on my papers. 
Since I’ve tried talking to my mom about it, I’ve stopped seeing my therapist, and she pretty much denies me the opportunity to go back to MY OWN psychiatrist. 
I know it’s because she doesnt want to admit to her neglectful behavior. She’s always been a self victimizer. Originally I planned on just trying to suck it up until I’m 18 and can care for myself, but I don’t think I’ll make it that long without help.

"I need guidance to help my son find the correct therapies, etc. Thank you so much. TLDR; What professionals should I make appointments with to help my son manage schizophrenia? He is currently making a medication switch and needs coping skills.

My son is 17, had a psychotic break and was hospitalized during January and February. This was the first time it ever happened though it has been leading up to this his entire life. We adopted our son and has only been with us for 2.5 years. He had a very traumatic childhood - his birth mother has undiagnosed mental conditions and lifelong alcohol/drug abuse. 

He was only in the hospital for 5 days before he came home. The doctor ""stabilized"" him with Risperdol which worked great for him until he realized it made him sexually dysfunctional. He stopped taking it without telling me and it was 2 days before I could tell. He is now making the switch to Seroquel with a much lighter dose of Risperdol until the Seroquel reaches a therapeutic dose that works for him.

I am fucking shocked and appalled at how hard it has been to find therapists, psychiatrists, support groups etc to help us. He is currently waiting for a psychiatrist appt (next week, have been waiting for fucking 1.5 months already) and is seeing a regular therapist once a week. His pediatrician has been a miracle worker and helping him with the medication switch. Though it isn't her specialty, she is going above and beyond to research and learn to tide him over until the psychiatrist appt.

Y'all, I am so lost. I am sitting down today and making ""aggressive"" phone calls to find my son some goddamn support. We're fighting for his life at this point because he his terrified that his life will be this hard for forever.

Does CBT help? Regular therapy but more often? Is there any sort of therapies or practices that I should look for? He is currently white knuckling the delusions, voices, auditory hallucinations, etc and I don't know what skills to help him learn how to use until I find a professional.

I am eternally grateful for my son's mental fortitude and the strength of our relationship. He sticks to me like glue since the breakdown and we talk openly and constantly. He's terrified and I will stop at nothing to help him.

"My boyfriend semi-gave me permission to restrict and I don’t know how to feel. Tw weight/calories/numbers mention For context: I relapsed last year and lost 35lbs in two months because my intake dropped to 150-350 calories per day. He saw that happen and basically forced me to start eating again because he was worried about me etc. I’ve gained about a stone since then and I just feel fucking horrible. 

We’ve been together for about 2 and a half years and our sex life has been non-existent for a couple of months now, but lacking for maybe 4-6 months. It’s partially due to stress I think, but largely due to my body image issues. Like, I just cringe at the thought of the areas I’m self-conscious about being touched. He says he feels rejected and unloved by me because there’s very little physical intimacy at all right now.

Anyway, he’s asked what would solve the issue and after several discussions I’ve just been like, you know fucking what? Starving myself would solve the issue. That’s about it. 

So he’s basically said that he doesn’t approve, but if I genuinely think that it would make things better between us physically, then he’ll turn a blind eye. He specified that he’d prefer me to eat at least 800 calories per day, but I think the implication is he wouldn’t stop me from going lower. 

I’m kind of conflicted now because it’s like, that IS what I want to do, and not having to actively hide it is perfect, but it just feels fucking shit that he saw what my relapse put me through and he’s just willing for that to happen again if it means we get to have sex? He says it’s about the physical intimacy between us specifically rather than sex in general (at one point I offered to let him sleep w other people because I’ve never needed to be monogamous and he turned that down) but it still makes me feel really weird. I just feel like if I thought there was something vital that was missing from the relationship that he had to starve himself in order for us to get back, then I’d sooner break up with him than threaten his health or wellbeing.

"The Worst PTSD Flashback OF My Life (trigger warning) Last week, I had the worst PTSD flashback of my life. It was the single most emotionally intense thing that I have ever experienced.

I have had flashbacks before, but this experience was on an entirely different level.  


This followed an extremely stressful day at work, an emotionally triggering conversation, and other things that individually would be manageable.  


It all started very quickly . I was suddenly on the ground in tears. It felt like my mind had split itself into multiple parts. One part was in on the ground struggling with an outpouring of emotion (tears, irregular breathing, raising heart rate), the other part was reliving all of the trauma that I have ever gone though. Reliving each occurrence in blinding succession. A third part, hyper aware of my wife watching this unfold (with concern for her well-being) and a fourth just kind of 'watching it all happen'

I meditate daily, and credit this with helping me to pull myself out of it. After what felt like 30 minutes (reality 2-4 ish) I was able to take a breath and start to detach from the occurrence and acknowledge and accept it (as I would with panic attacks). 

For the next two days I felt like all my confidence was gone. I was afraid to leave the house and make any decisions. I am still recovering a week later.  


I talk about this in depth here if you would like more details. [https://medium.com/invisible-illness/ptsd-is-real-24fb30fcc0a](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/ptsd-is-real-24fb30fcc0a)

"At the end of my rope with autistic son's obsession. Need advice. My 4yo son who is otherwise mildly impacted has an obsession with cars. I don't mean he likes cars or enjoys them or is fascinated with them. I mean they are the center of his Universe to an extent that it is tearing me and my wife to shreds. Any time he meets someone, the first thing he will ask them is ""which car do you have? can I sit in it?"". By a conservative estimate, my wife and I probably spend anywhere from 4 to 6 hours a day sitting in one of our two cars with him. He just likes to get in the driver's seat, pretend he's turning it on, then pretend he's turning it off, then get out saying ""I need to get something from the back"" and then go open the rear door or the trunk and pretend to take something out before coming back in to the driver's seat. And like I said, as a conservative estimate, this happens on average 4-6 hours a day. Considering that he sleeps about 10-12 hours at night, this equates to 33%-50% of his waking time. It might seem comical to someone who hasn't lived through it but sitting with him in the car is so irritating to me and my wife that once one of us ""taps out"" and the other one goes in, the newly relieved parent can normally be found screaming and sobbing into a pillow. I have seriously considered suicide. I have seriously considered abandoning my wife and son. I have seriously considered fleeing the country. He is in ABA therapy and we have asked his therapists and they have no reasonable options for us other than ""it'll hopefully get better with time"". At times I blame him for being this way, I blame myself for having had a child in the first place. I just need some help, I need someone who is on the spectrum to tell me what is going on inside his brain? Why is he so obsessed with cars? If my wife or I force him out of the car and make him stay out he cries and wails for hours until he has breathing issues. We have had the police called on us by our neighbors because they have thought we are abusing him.

I hope that some of you can relate and that it brings a bit of hope, among all the anger that infects us.

Dear Tom
It's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.

I wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.

Peace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.

I also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask ""how's school?"", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than ""good"" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.

So you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be ""normal"", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be ""normal"" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what ""normal"" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.

The affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.

I have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.

My anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say ""What's wrong with you?"". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.

My depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.

Since my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.

I'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.

You have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.

You used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line ""you're destroying this family"" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.

But now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said ""you're destroying the family""; what you meant was something different. ""Family"" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, ""Family"" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was ""you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear"" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.

You'd also say ""I put a roof over your head"". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. ""I did my job, so now you owe me"". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the ""family"".

You aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.

I could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The ""zig-zag"" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.

Words can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that ""my kid is dying"" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.

You might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your ""gifts"". The toys were a way of saying ""sorry I bashed your head the other day"", or maybe ""please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute"". The car was a way of saying ""please disappear"". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was ""destroying the family"" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a ""bad investment"" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple ""grudge"" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your ""gifts"".

Sometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. ""Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years"", ""nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?"", ""nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?"", ""nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?"". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in ""raising"" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and ""destroy the family"".

Another inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.

I tried to explain what it was like to be ""raised"" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.

Moving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.

I'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.

On days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.

I think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.

It's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.

This letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to ""destroy the family"".",ptsd,ptsd
"So, it happened. My nightmare. Hi everyone! I’m gonna keep this post as short as possible as I’m basically just freaked out and really feel extremely alone right now. 
So I’ve had about a good 2 months of binging and I went from about 110-115 to a good 121 (which isn’t even a gigantic change) but last night at work one of my coworkers said to me,
“You’ve our back on some weight. You look good.”
Yep. It happened. First time. I felt my heart SINK. I wanted to cry. For some reason, it motivated me even more. That’s what it took for me.

Has anyone had this happen to you? Btw one of the reasons it hurt so bad is because these coworkers have seen my weight drop to it’s lowest so it’s not like a random weight gain. She noticed I put some BACK on.

"I took the Aspergers quiz online and I don’t know what to do. Here’s a little backstory.
I was diagnosed with ADHD by a child psychologist at the age of 8 and for the past 11 years that’s what I believed. 
    I wouldn’t call myself normal; in fact I’ve always been known as either quiet for most people or weird by others. I have always struggled with maintaining eye contact with people, I have never “opened up” to anyone even my parents, I’m always trying to figure out what facial expressions to make, I have to think about how something should make me feel versus me actually feeling right then, It’s really hard for me to have conversations because i never know what to say or what tone I should use, even if I say something and it sounds clear to me people will have a hard time understanding me sometimes. Honestly I can go on but I’m just going to keep this short so just comment if you want to hear more
Now at the age of 19 after going through a certain event that left me questioning everything about the way I feel/show my feelings to people and just flat out not knowing how to communicate well I started researching and stumbled upon the Aspergers test so I took it and scored a 36, then I took it again and scored a 36. 
I really don’t know what to do, I’m not sure if I’m being overreactive and using this as an excuse for just being socially awkward, or that I just don’t have adhd and this could be a possible explanation for all my abnormalities.

"How can I help my alcoholic epileptic brother? I’m at a complete loss at this point. I love my brother so much and just don’t know how to help him. My 29 year old brother is currently in a medically induced coma due to (they think) aspirating on his vomit during 4 grand mal seizures in a row. The doctors have all said he keeps having seizures due to his alcohol consumption. This is the worst it’s ever been. Every time he has a seizure, he gets worse and worse mentally and he has a harder and harder time coming out of the seizure. He has been an alcoholic for around 9 years. It used to be so bad that he would drink until he couldn’t even see. He has definitely cut way back from that time in his life but is still drinking a 6 pack of tall boys a night, 2-4 shots, and sometimes just whatever he can find in my parents house. He still lives with my parents, is on disability, drinks every day, is addicted to nicotine and smokes pot all day long. All of his money goes towards his addictions, in fact he is broke by the 3rd week of the month. At that point my mom pays for his stuff. 

Not only is he an addict but he is also mentally immature and has been his entire life. He basically has the brain of a 15 year old but he has never been actually diagnosed with anything. He also seems like he is bipolar but I think that’s more the addictions talking. He has a lot of hurt inside of him from bad relationships and being severely bullied as a child and teen. 

Basically, he doesn’t believe he has any problems. He believes everyone else is the problem not him. But he has come to us many many times begging for help to get sober. When we talk to him or try to help he then refuses. 

Here is our biggest problem: my mother. She is an enabler. She buys his alcohol, does his laundry, clothes, everything for him. She says it’s the only way to get him to change. My dad, my brothers, and I are trying to do everything we can to help him get to rehab. We would like to have an intervention of sorts for him when he gets home from the hospital. We know he’s a very emotional person and this coma is going to scare the hell out of him so we feel it’s the best time. Not only that but he will be sober for a least a week by the time he’s home (if all goes well). I think we should all write letters to him and read them aloud to him together. 

My mom agrees with us then says “that won’t work. The only thing that will work is loving him and letting him be who he is. He just needs love because he has never been accepted”. My fear is that she will somehow ruin this intervention. 

I am terrified that the next time my brother has a seizure, he won’t come home. Everyone but my mother knows if he doesn’t cut out alcohol, that’s what will happen. I know it’s possible he will yell and scream at us and we will get no where. If that happens, my mom has already said she will go right back to buying his alcohol for him because there is “nothing else we can do”. My other brother wants to get a court order for rehab but I don’t really know if that’s a good idea because I’ve heard forcing someone into rehab is the worst thing you can do. Not really sure. 

My brother has a lot of problems, but he has a heart of gold. He would give you the shirt off of his back. I know with the right help, he can live a good life without needing my parents. I want that so badly for him. Please if anyone has advice for how to at least get him some kind of help, leave a comment.

"I’m so insecure and frustrated. I don’t think I can do this anymore I’m about to turn 17. I’ve been actively trying to lose weight and be skinny ever since I can remember and I have never felt comfortable in my body. I promised myself I’d reach my goal weight by 17 this week and I’m far from it. It’s so frustrating. I’m 100% sick of it. I keep binging even though I don’t really feel like eating and everything is just so infuriating. I’m also about to go back to school and I feel so ugly and fat that I can’t bear anyone seeing me. I don’t wanna have to go back looking like this. The only thing that boosts my self esteem and allows me to express myself is fashion and wearing cute outfits but those don’t look good on my big body!! I even bought a bunch of cute clothes over the summer that would only fit once I reach my goal weight to motivate me and because I was sired id reach it by now but again I was wrong after thousands of these attempts. I know this is so silly but I cant help feeling this way. The hatred I have for my body is beginning to consume me. I can’t even be myself and it feels like my entire life and my goals and happiness are on pause until I’m skinny. It all relies on my appearance. It’s ridiculous. I can’t believe I’m really convinced being skinny will fix my life or something but I keep holding onto that because I actually do believe it to be true. I don’t have friends, I’m ugly, I don’t get attention, etc etc ALL BECAUSE IM FAT. The logical part of me thinks that’s probably not true but my disordered part convinces me otherwise. Idek where I’m going with this. I guess I’m wondering if there’s anyone out there who’s going through the same crap or has gone through this in the past and has tips to help me feel better. I just want to be skinny and it’s so easy so why do I keep ruining it and failing?!?!? I can’t take another day looking like this. It feels like I’m stuck in an astronaut suit 24/7. I despise myself and my lack of discipline and my brain and my body and everything.  Someone help. I feel like I’ll never be able to get through this on my own but idk how to tell my mom about it. She’s amazing and I know she’ll understand and help me but I’m so ashamed and it’s too embarrassing for me to tell her about it. It’s something I thought I could accomplish  and get through on my own but I can’t and I’m too prideful to admit that. I don’t know what to do. I really thought I could do this alone. Idk

"Please help with your perception Not sure if I'm in the right place her. But I need some advice.
I do not feel good since my son's birth more than six months ago.
It varies from day to day but never stops.
I'm often triggered by people talking about their experiences or media and now afraid that this is no longer healthy coping and I might need help.
How long am I allowed to think about  bad experience s?
Could you please read and tell me what you think?

Months before birth I realized I'm in big fear and reached out for help. I received some help (calming talk) from the hospital staff, and it helped but I never lost the fear completely and before delivery I knew (or had the idea) that the experience will have a big impact on my mental health.

My birth was ""uncomplicated"" speaking in medical language but dramatic from my perspective. I had a very rushed delivery, hyperactive labor with no breaks. Less than two hours and no time left to receive pain medication.

I had minor birth injuries and the baby was healthy, and I had a quick recovery.
Everybody told me to be proud and that I ""did a good job"" but on the morning of the next day, I was not proud, I was in tears. My husband mentioned ""it wasn't that dramatic as expected"" and I was furious. 

I told the nurse I felt like meat and cried. I felt terribly embarrassed and unable to explain the exact reason.
This feeling lasts until know, and I still think every fucking day about it.
I feel, that everybody expects me to be thankful for the short time of labor and the healthy baby and to shut up about my feelings.

Some feelings I have in varying strengt (it is not always as dramatic as it sounds below but always at least a small voice from the background):

I suffer from the temporary loss of control and the brutality of the process. I'm ashamed and feel dirty because everybody knows what I have gone through. I feel weak because I begged for pain medication.
I'm hurt because I do not remember everything properly.
I feel like an object, not like a person. I'm afraid that this feeling will repeat as soon as I'm old or sick and dependent on medical staff.
I feel mutilated when I look at the scars or touch them.
I'm confused because often, I think I shouldn't make a fuss.

I know that some of my thoughts are bullshit and wrong in many ways, but I feel that I'm brainwashed (especially with the ""dirty"" and ""ashamed"" part)I never expected to think this way.
I'm battling these thoughts but I struggle really hard.
I talked to many women about their experience and I have the strong feeling that many of them have similar feelings.

Right now after writing this down I feel silly but better than before.",ptsd,ptsd

"Frustrated with myself and relapses A couple months I gave a speech at my school about my struggle with bulimia to bring awareness to eating disorders. Of course, I ended with the note that I was recovering. 

Yes, I have drastically improved during recovery, and I genuinely cannot imagine doing half the things I did on a daily basis while at my worst. But recently, I've been relapsing: I would overeat after failing my (subconscious) daily food plan and feel an urge to throw up. In fact, I think I've thrown up more times this month than I had from January to May. 

Another problem is that due to burnout and an exhausting internship, I've been too tired to work out regularly. My stomach's been pretty darn bloated, and it doesn't help that I already feel the fat in most other areas of my body constantly. Usually, I work out to help reduce this annoying feeling, but with the increased awareness of my body fat and my constant exhaustion, I can't do that. This is causing the anxiousness that I used to always feel when I missed a workout day come back (I literally broke down for the past three days because of how miserable and crappy I felt). 

Obviously, this is super mild compared to what most bulimics (including my former self) face daily. But, ever since I finally started getting treatment a year ago, my recovery had been consistent. This month's rockiness really hit me hard and threw me off track. 

I just find it so ironic that I put myself out in front of the school as not only an advocate for ED awareness but also as as a guidance for my classmates who were struggling with an ED, when in reality I am basically slowly shifting back into my old habits.",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous
"Where do I start? I'm a 20 year old FTM in Oklahoma. I've never been officially diagnosed, but recently my general physician said it was really likely that I have Asperger's.

Knowing that this is a possibility makes me feel a lot better, because now that I know, I can start to fix certain behaviour in the correct and most effective way. 

My problem is, I'm not sure where to start? Do I need to get a formal diagnosis? If so, how do I do that?

And instead of telling her how to play, you decide to let her figure out how to play on her own, the only thing you tell her is to win the game.

So now, poor 80 year old grandma is playing a game she knows nothing about and has no idea how to play.

"Missed appointments / incorrect times. Your experience in dealing with numbers? So I find myself sitting in a lounge having missed by exactly one hour when my certification class started. Somehow this is not the first time this happened (thankfully though not for this course). 

Rather than beat myself up about it I want to try and be as methodical as possible - here’s what happened. 

-Scheduled certification class several weeks ago. Did not put class on calendar

-Subsequently forgot about said class

-Planned to meet friend at 4:00 for coffee today -had a nagging feeling I was forgetting something. 

-Remembered this week about the certification class- double checked my email. Sure enough, I confirmed that it was today, 4/4 - it did not even register with me that the email said 3:00. (Cortical blindness???)

-Show up punctually late today at 4 and am completely baffled that the event started at 3. 

My first mistake was not putting it in my Google calendar ***immediately on scheduling it***. I think part of me is resistant to putting up a bunch of safeguards like google calendars, notifications, etc because I want to be the kind of person who can remember a simple thing like an appointment time - that treating myself like an 8 year old with mittens tied to her coat is embarrassing.

"Torn About College Hi everyone! I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that ""traditional college experience."" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. 

My other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the ""Traditional college experience"" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do.

All these thoughts about the abuse have piled up and now that my gate is down, they’re all flooding back in. I’m struggling with it so much but I came to this sub and reading everyone’s experience has helped me come to terms with the fact I have PTSD. When I was first diagnosed over a year ago I shrugged it off thinking of people who have survived so much worse than me. But now that I’m not shutting my feelings down, I’m realizing just how bad it’s gotten. I read symptoms and stories on this sub last night and cried over how much I understood those symptoms and feelings.

"Unsure about things So I’m 28 years old and have been drinking for quite some time.  The reason I am reaching out is because I am unsure of what my status is, if it’s even fixable, or if I will need to go 100% sober for the rest of my life.  Long story short, I’m mostly a binge drinker, I go out every few weekends and I drink with friends.  I don’t really drink during the week at all and if I do it’s 1 or 2 drinks rarely, and I stop no problem.  The Problem is, is on weekends once I hit a certain point, it’s like a switch is turned and I can’t stop drinking until I am completely inebriated, it’s almost a feeling of “I’m not drunk enough.” This is kind of an ongoing problem, it’s not every time I go out, sometimes I can keep it under control, but a lot of times I can’t. I’m so scared because my fiancé almost broke up with me this weekend  because it’s been an issue we’ve talked about, and I can turn into a jerk and say stupid things when she’s just trying to help me.  She’s tired of “babysitting” me when I get to that level of drunk.  This is my last chance, she will not have this conversation with me again.  One of my methods to try and fix it  have been trying to count my drinks and set a hard number when I go out, but after a certain point I lose it or forget what I was at and then all bets are out the window.  What makes all this confusing for me is I don’t need alcohol, I have no problem not drinking.  I have no problem having one or 2 drinks casually and stopping, it’s an issue when I start to get above 6-8 drinks when I’m out partying that the switch is turned.  My plan is to completely abstain from alcohol for the month of September at the very least.  Learn how to have fun sober, and then after I have learned to do that, maybe have a few drinks with friends, and if I feel myself getting to my old ways, removing myself from the situation.  All of my friends are behind me on any choice that I choose and my fiancé will be there to help me as well as my family, so I have a support system in place.  My question is, what do you guys think, is this a good plan? Are there any other good methods, or do I need to go 100% sober for the rest of my life?

"Refined foods and excessive electronic use by themselves don’t make autism worse, but that autistic individuals are unable to cope with addiction and pleasure stimulation. I just thought about this, what do you guys think? A GFCF diet may help with a person with addiction to grains, sugar and dairy, but it won’t make autism alone better, it will make the symptoms better because the autistic individual isn’t responding to addictive stimuli and craving addictive substances from these foods. 

While most neirotypical people keep their addiction in control, an autist will likely respond out of anger, screaming, paranoia, or violence to get their fix. When they do, they will be upset because they don’t like how it feels, yet are dependent on it.",autism,autism

"ADHD performance issues stopped me from getting a schedule change permitted… Might need to leave my job as a result. Ok, here is my situation. I work in a group home. I am also in school. I need to change my schedule to accommodate my changing class schedule. To me it seemed like an easy change- there is an open shift and I want to switch one of my shifts to that open shift. No one else's schedules affected, etc. 

My boss said it would be fine, but had to approve with his boss. His boss shut it down. She said that my performance wasn't good enough to accommodate a schedule change, and she'd rather me leave than go through the inconvenience.... Her ""performance issues"" that she stated were very concrete things I struggle with bc of my ADHD. I sometimes forget small tasks related to cleaning the house, such as making the resident beds, finishing laundry on time, etc. These things have been brought up in performance reviews and have gotten better, and my boss knows I'm working on them. To ""make up"" for it, I always try to pick up open shifts when possible, even if it means changing my schedule. I have a great relationship with the residents and have introduced them to new activities- He has me as the designated activity coordinator because I'm really good at encouraging the residents to try new things, and they have a positive relationship with the guys, so they trust me to help them through new things. There's a reason that I'm not the medication staff or the finance staff, and I appreciate my boss using me for my strengths. 

My boss seems genuinely bummed that I might have to leave.... but he says he has no control over it. I'm just really shocked that this woman thinks that me forgetting menial tasks makes me ""lazy and unenergetic"" (her words), and that my positive contributions are outweighed by such minor things. She doesn't see me interact with the residents, she's never here when I am, so the only thing she sees are the beds sometimes unmade or office disorganized after my shifts. I understand why her opinion is negative if that's all she sees, but I'm surprised that it's negative enough that she would rather me be replaced than accommodate a simple and easy schedule change. 

If I leave my job, I lose my health insurance &lt;- and my psychiatrist and meds. I will also owe my workplace 2000 dollars (I took an education grant that requires me to stay at least another year or I have to pay it back). I will break the positive relationships I've built with the residents, and my boss will have to fill 3 overnight shifts. So... it will suck. I can't change my class schedule, so it slows down my education if I miss out on this class I need to take. Every other employee in the house has had schedule changes approved (we are all students, and need them frequently) so it really sucks and hurts that I am not valued enough to keep. 

I haven't been open with my boss about my ADHD. Is this something I can bring up now? I don't want it to come across that I ""suddenly have adhd"" to explain all of my performance errors. I'm on medication, but it's a recent diagnosis and I'm still trialing meds and finding something that works. Ritalin has been helping a lot with focus, but also makes me appear ""lazy and unenergetic""... as that is the thing that helps with focus... I could go unmedicated and show her (boss's boss) a different side of me, but not sure that's what she's looking for either.... I'll be more energetic, but the beds will ALWAYS be unmade, dishes undone, I'll forget the residents schedules, and spend my long shifts on reddit.... just making predictions here.

I feel stuck. Trying not to let it affect my self esteem. Also, I know logically that stuff will work out even if I have to find another job. My fiance can put me on his health insurance, and I would eventually be able to pay education grant back.

"EMDR therapy for help with panic attacks? Some backstory: 

Three years ago I experienced a random panic attack while I was driving. I didn't know what it was at the time but I thought I was about to die (heart attack or suffocation)

It took me a bit to get back in the car and drive anywhere. I transferred schools and lived away for three years without a car and I didn't think anything of it anymore. Now, I am out of school and living back home and I am severely limited by where I can drive and I still don't drive in the same place anymore as where I had my first attack.

So I started seeing a CBT therapist in August and just went to see a psychiatrist last Saturday. My psychiatrist treated veterans at the VA suffering from PTSD. He asked me if I've ever had a near death experience or been through something traumatic. I told him no and that I didn't know if I could call my first panic attack a traumatic experience but it was to me and I've never felt so scared in my life. He told me that counts.

That's when I sort of reassessed what I've been dealing with. I've been sure I've had panic disorder, except I only ever get them when the variables are the same as the first time. (Me driving, hot day, etc.) I haven't ever suffered a random panic attack since then.

"Intense images/fear of the moment I die is often the first sign of withdrawal. Anyone else? Title pretty much explains it for the most part. I've been drinking excessively for 10 years, virtually every day for the past two years (10-15 units a day on average and I know exactly how unhealthy it is). I've begun serious attempts to give up, with some temporary (but amazing) success at the beginning of this year where I drank just twice a week, and only a few drinks on those days - medically healthy amounts. It was great. Then life happened and now I'm here again.

The point of the post is I can always tell when my withdrawals are beginning (in their mild phase), because I get these horribly vivid images of my moment of death, and they terrify the shit out of me. It can be so vivid, I can feel the adrenaline running and feel disoriented, very much like waking up from a nightmare. For a moment once it felt like I went to sleep and it was as vivid as an actual nightmare. 

I know it's not the normal 'fear anxiety' because I don't usually have it, and I don't actually worry about it most of the day. When I manged to give up before, the episodes completely went away. I was fine. These are clearly related to alcohol withdrawal, and are very short, very intense episodes of fear. They make it harder to give up drinking. It's just another thing that convinces me that my drinking is having a toll and I should get through the worst of it and be done here. (Don't worry guys, I never give up cold turkey and am well aware of the risks and how to manage them). 

I'm mainly wondering whether this is common, or more specific to me. Any of you guys experienced this phenomenon at all, and was it specific to alcohol withdrawals or just a general thing?",alcoholism,alcoholism
"Update after almost a year It's been a while since I have posted in here, and I hope that this doesn't come off as bragging because I know the struggles of progressively getting worse all too well.

I am nearing the 1 year mark from the last hallucination. Within a month, I am seeing my psych and working with her to lower my dose of Latuda (currently 160mg/day). I have already eliminated the small dose of Haldol that I had gone on a year ago due to the hallucinations.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that everyone is probably sick of hearing it, but I really do believe that this is all because of changes to my diet. I have been following a paleo/primal version of keto since April 2018. I dropped 40lb, lowered my cholesterol, and am getting better with regards to my psychosis. I specify that I follow primal because it means that I don't eat vegetable oil or any other unnatural foods. I typically eat tuna &amp; sardine salad made with avocado oil mayo for lunch. So, I am covering all my bases by increasing omega 3 as well as eliminating processed food.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as exercise goes, I run long distances at a low-effort level. This took time to get to a reasonable pace and had to start out simply by walking to maintain the target heartrate that I follow (180-my age: 147bpm).

Universities are busy and crowded, and I know I will isolate myself from others (unless I can connect with other disabled or mentally ill students) because the academics will consume my time.

"Desperately need to move out. I currently live in a small one-room container-thing with my father and it's absolutely awful. My father is not a bad person by any means, I'm relatively lucky that I have pretty alright parents. Though, this type of living is making me go absolutely batty. This space is pretty small, probably a bedroom and a half large, and I have a very small section of it. I just have my desk and a shelf for my books and instruments tucked in a corner while my father's workshop, 3 motorcycles, large array of power tools and such covers the rest. I was fine and tolerating this for about a month, but I'm really started to get extremely stressed about 3 months in to this living situation. My insomnia problems have absolutely sky rocketed to near uncontrollable, as this kind of living situation does not fare well to the typically erratic sleeping schedule that I have during particularly bad insomniac breaks, and over the last few weeks I've not slept for longer than 4 hours at a time, with frequent multiple days in a row without sleep (30-40 hours awake). My father seems to have absolutely no qualms at all about using loud grindy tool when I'm trying to do something to escape like reading or games, or blasting music out his speakers when I'm trying to sleep. My psychosis has been at an all-time high during this, after a fantastic long period of having almost no psychotic symptoms at all. I would confront my father about this but he's been extremely emotionally unavailable as he is currently mid-way through a mental breakdown of his own, as he has just left an extremely harsh physically/mentally/emotionally abusive marriage. And obviously being a spectator to my father's emotional spiraling hasn't been much of a help on my mental state either. I just desperately feel like I need to get out of here. I need solitude, quietness, space to breathe.

"How to (re)form a friendship with someone who has ASD? So recently, I fought with a close friend who apparently suffers from autism, mainly because she was putting unrealistic expectations for me in regards to making friends. After not talking for a while (because she told me not to), we decided to have another talk about the whole situation. I forgot about how autism can cause paranoia and the inability to understand another's emotions, so I talked about how I felt and whether we should remain friends. While at first she wanted to remain friends (I was asking her if it was okay and if it wasn't negatively impacting her emotionally) she later decided that she didn't want to remain my friend by the end of our talk and that she thought of me as a predator trying to use her (this was due to the fact that I did not talk to her for a while after our argument). She says she still wants to see me try and become her friend and that I have to put in a lot of effort to try and convince her. I still want to retain this friendship but I'm not sure what steps I should be prepared to take in order to do so. In addition, we are only able to talk at school and through video calls, since her parents are very hesitant to let me hangout with her outside of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I say in order to get her to emotionally reconsider being friends? It was a precious friendship for me. She says she doesn't understand how I feel but I don't understand the sudden shift from wanting to be friends still to suddenly not wanting to.

"NSFW: Diagnosed with PTSD. Root trauma from five years ago. I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. 

1. The ""leader"" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like ""You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?"". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending ""laugh"" like ""Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha."" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.
2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.
3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.
4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like ""go kill yourself no one loves you""
5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.
6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.

Over 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this. I feel like I wasted so much of my potential and energy during college and feel this is part of why I'm struggling so much in the present. I think hanging out with the ""best friend"" in recent years triggered it even more, and I've been stuck in a rut for nearly a year since then.

Hello all!

New here, new throwaway too. I was diagnosed with CPTSD in 2013, and since then my symptoms have remained the same.

But instead I just played video games and jacked off. This kind of thing is becoming far to common in my life. I'm just chasing the cheapest source of dopamine, and nothing else matters.

I have a diagnosis of MDD, and I know this has been a really long episode. Probably 3 weeks now since it got really bad. In fact, 3 weeks and 3 years ago was the date on which I attempted suicide. It was something I kept quiet about for all three years, until I made an ""anniversary"" post on Instagram. The point was really just to not keep that shit so tightly wrapped, in the hopes that maybe it wouldn't weigh on me as much as it did. But if anything, making a big deal out of my past like that just made stuff worse. So yeah, 3 weeks ago is when it got really bad.

The end of last semester was tough as well. Similar kind of situation: skipping classes, neglecting homework, drinking wayyy too often, the works. There was actually a period of 3 straight weeks, from late November into December, where I did not attend a single class. 

I'm so over school right now, but I'm really scared of what kind of life I'll have if I don't graduate.",adhd,adhd
"Forgetting things I try to study or things I've read TL;DR: I seem to forget more when on medication.

I am getting medicated and I am really happy with it. However something I noticed that is rather glaring and a real problem for me is the fact that it seems everything I try to study or hold in memory often just slips out of my mind. Without medication (10mg of Retalin twice a day) I seem to be able to remember a lot more, but lack motivation and get slightly depressed. Which leads to me doing nothing which leads to more depression etc. It really is worrying as a few days of daily repeating something without medication seem to be gone out of my memory within a week. 

Does anyone have a similar experience and can offer some help?",adhd,adhd
"I realized that I look very irritated a lot of times and that people actually notice. I talked to people who I'm in a school project with and they say they didn't want to give suggestions to me because they didn't know if I would take it normally or get irritated. I said they shouldn't worry about it and that they can say anything to me.

But this still let me know myself a little bit better. I didn't know people felt that way about me. I didn't know I gave off that vibe but if I think about I understand. I am going to pay more attention to how I respond to things and catch myself if I notice I give off that vibe.

"ADHD and weight loss issues Long time lurker here!

Im mostly look for tips, tricks and advice but here goes!

(As a side note i am not currently on any ADHD medication)

Do you any of you guys struggle massively with your eating habits
I have recently put on about 25 pounds and no matter how hard i try or how good my intentions are: i cant seem to stick to a diet or exercise routine. I sometimes do okay for a week and then suddenly I am back to eating takeout everyday and mildly bingeing. I also have a hard time not eating meals at home, and I am starting to think eating take out has become a small way of getting a dopamine fix. Im a student and this is causing some money issues, but in the moment i cant seem to stop. I have read a few different articles citing ADD folks often have trouble with weight.

"Experiences with using an ""Alexa"" or ""Amazon Echo"" for efficient and easy organization? So far in my life the ONLY way I have been able to stay remotely organized is setting reminders in my phone. I have tried journaling, different planners, calendars on my wall, basically everything. The only thing that SOMEWHAT works is the voice function in my phone where I will physically talk to it and it will help me remember stuff.

From researching I've found that Alexa and Echo are pretty much the best AI assistance right now and they are ""always listening"" so I don't have to unlock my phone or whatever. Plus they can sync with it.

Take your time to mourn the life you had, but when your tears dry and the side effects settle, it's up to you from there.  Day by day slowly coming back from the madness and severity. You'll find your place. And on days when you relapse take it slow rest, heal, and try again. There's no shame in progressing and in the end thriving after several recoveries. You are worth it.

"I might be finally able to work through my PTSD. This is my first post on here, so I'll give a little backstory. I don't know if a trigger warning would apply here; I'm not going to describe anything, and the trauma was ""minor"" compared to what other people have gone through. But regardless...

My PTSD stemmed from a very minor car accident when I was 17. It took years for a therapist to put the pieces together and diagnose me, but I've only driven a car a handful of times since the accident over 6 and a half years ago, and being in or around cars causes me to become hypervigilant. It's been almost impossible to accept because when I was 17 I wanted to be a mechanic and work on cars, and I went from loving them to being terrified of them.

Recently I've been obsessed with the idea of getting a car for myself. I don't know why, but it just got into my head that I want an adorable, typical girl car with a cute paint job and girly accessories. I'm starting to see myself have the same passion I used to for cars. I want to look at engines and talk about hybrid vs electric. I even drove a couple days ago, and didn't need to stop because I was anxious. I feel the best I have about driving in 6 years. Like I could actually do it.

I don't know if anyone will care, but I have nowhere else to share this and I'm honestly kind of excited. I was so excited to get my license 7 years ago that I got a 100% on my permit test. PTSD stole that dream from me, but maybe I can take it back. It won't be easy, but I have a loving wife and an abandonded office complex near the house to practice driving in, so there's no reason to not try. Thanks for reading.",ptsd,ptsd

"Not sure where to go from here Hey folks,  
I'm a 25 year old male, started drinking about 13 and then heavily from about 16 or so.  
Started getting withdrawals somewhere in my early 20s.

It's happened before but alcohol is starting to have a major negative impact on my life.

Nevermind the health implications I started a new job about a month and a half ago and I've had mild withdrawals twice within that time. I'm verbally abusive to my girlfriend when I'm drunk. I lost all of last weekend, on the Friday I hit on all of my long term girlfriends friends whilst in the pub with her, on the Saturday I tried to touch up my best friends SO which resulted in us kicking the shit out of each other.

I need to do something about this but I really don't want to. I managed to not drink for a bit, 9 months in total. Someone told me once it took 6 months of not drinking before our livers started repairing themselves which meant mines had 3 months rest in 9 years. I don't think I can do AA, I'm not a big fan of groups or the whole religious aspect and aside from a court ordered councilor I've never spoken to a professional about this.

I know I need to cut out drink but I neither want to nor know how.

"I'm not sure if I'm just lazy or if I really have ADHD (hard to explain to immigrant parents too) I have always struggled with concentrating, especially on tasks that I find boring. I had seen a psychiatrist when I was a child; the psychiatrist only remarked I had issues concentrating, but never gave me any diagnosis.


My parents were very strict and for most of my childhood I studied all of the time and they constantly supervised me. My attention still wandered off, but just with all the time I was sitting there studying, I did well in school. As I got older, I was still doing well, but I wasn't studying very hard and just coasting along, and coasted into a professional program, but now I have to legitimately work hard. I have depression and anxiety as well, and I am getting treatment for those as my current psychiatrist said that we have to help me resolve some of these symptoms before we look at ADHD as anxiety and depression can have some of the same symptoms as ADHD.




I see the symptoms of ADHD listed online and I relate to alot of them, like getting excited about multiple things and never finding the motivation to start or finish them, having multiple tabs open, interrupting conversations, not being able to pay attention to what is said to me, fidgetting, and impulse shopping but I can't tell if I'm just a lazy SOB. I feel so awful for not being able to find the motivation to do what I want and if I'm just making excuses for myself.

"Incredibly quick mood swings/personality switches/memory loss Hi, new here. My mother is an alcoholic. When she's drunk, she's a verbally aggressive drunk. Complains about things that weren't an issue before, gets insulting, irrational, impulsive. So whenever that starts, I usually know the evening will continue like that and eventually get worse.
However, sometimes like today I notice something way more unsettling to me than dealing with anger. She changes rapidly. Was insulting me moments ago, and then switches to talking normally again, rationally, even laughing about something naturally, calm. As if sober. Can drunkenness subside that easily? It's as if there are two personalities within her, neither knowing about the other. She can insult me and right after compliment my shoes. It's like a very noticeable switch in her brain. It also seems that she doesn't remember what she did while in rage. Right after she switched to calm, even though I still firmly believe still intoxicated, she says that poor me I had to make that bed alone (bunk bed usually needs two people) and I just said mom you did that part just moments ago by yourself. It wasn't me. She didn't remember. She made the bed while she was angry. Is that short memory loss to every action connected to anger outbursts normal for alcoholism, does something like temporary alcoholic amnesia exist or idk, did some of you experience this before. Because I came to the point not knowing if she's showing normal emotions or if she's intoxicated, because she goes back to normal so quickly, even contentness that it's quite eerie.

Being my stoned and open self I said uh, yeah..... there’s calories. My friends ignored it and ate the chocolates. 
Few minutes later they started tripping. Turns out the friend had been lied too. There was something in the chocolate he gave us and he didn’t know. Thanks avoiding calories. I avoided that.",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"Meant to be? Hello everyone. This is my first post so i'll try my best. I (27M) caught my wife (28F) cheating with two different men after 5 years of marriage and 3 children. The cheating started when I lost my job as a police officer and the bank account started getting low. Each time I caught my wife, she says she is cheating because I drink too much and she doesnt like it. I drank probably 5 days a week and limited myself to two 16 oz. beers per day and sometimes would allow an additional 16 oz. if I was feeling like it. She says that I have been drinking since we met and she doesnt want me drinking around our 3 children. I explained that I was still able to function and take care of the children but she still insisted that its wrong to drink at all. 

So the first guy she cheated on me with was my best friend in the police academy, the second was some guy I went to high school with. After catching her with my friend from the police academy, I started drinking alot more and it lasted for a few weeks. When I caught her with the second guy, It picked up even more. The pain was so unbearable knowing that my wife wanted to be with other men. On Feb. 16th I went to my best friends house to vent to him. I told him everything that had been going on and he told me that I need to leave the house and get out of that toxic environment. He said that if I dont leave then the problem is only going to get worse.

On the way home I got some vodka and drank it. I didnt make it home. I was so wasted that I pulled over in a church parking lot and cried myself to sleep. A police officer found me and brought me to the hospital due to my unresponsiveness. He didnt arrest me for DUI. What an angel he was! When I got out of the hospital, I went home and packed a bag. I went to my mom's house and cried for hours. I fell asleep and woke up the next morning.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up and felt like shit. All I could think about was my wife sleeping with other men and confusing my children with these different guys coming around. I thought about the future and what I was going to tell the kids when they ask why me and their mom arent together anymore. This saddened me very much. I thought about what my future is going to bring and about how I'm gonna pay all the bills that I'm behind on. My wife never wanted to work and stayed at home to raise the kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

BUT...of all the things I thought about, alcohol was not one of them. I don't understand! How can one enjoy drinking, then drink all the time to cope with their problems, then just quit in one day? I havent had a drink since Feb. 16th. I can pass gas stations and liquor stores and not even think about stopping. Im just so confused. I am still sad and I miss the way my wife and I used to be when I was a cop. I miss how we used to play with the chidren and take them places. We were the perfect family and now thats gone. I'm sad all the time but I just dont want alcohol at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

After thinking about it, I've started to wonder if my wife was the reason that I drank at all. I do recall several times where i've been driving home from work and thought, ""shit, I gotta deal with my wife when I get home."" I love my wife but she wasn't exactly thre greatest person in the world. She frequently would tell my that I was a bad husband if I didnt do what she wanted me to do. She would not have anything done around the house when I got home. She spent so much money that I would have to take extra shifts to keep up. She complained alot when I played my playstation or wacthed something other than what she wanted. I also never got over the fact that she kicked me out of the house when I was in the police academy because we had no money.

&amp;#x200B;

So im wondering...is it possible to love someone yet drink to deal with all the emotional greif they cause you. I'm just so confused here. I always thought alcoholics had to go through recovery to stop drinking??? Any thoughts would be nice. Sorry if this is a scattered and shitty post, ill do better in the future, I promise.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"I feel like I am slowly losing myself I’ve struggled with delusions and paranoia since I was 17, was periodic, last a month or so usually in times of stress or abuse. It didn’t usually build up too much in the sense of one big all encompassing delusion, it was more, lots of small triggers that slowly reduced my freedoms... someone using a weed eater as I walked past - I was going to be killed by them. Being brought a cup of tea - it was poisoned. 

I’m 24 now and things have progressed... I spent a whole month unable to leave my house, afraid of airdropped poison after building paranoia and  a major delusion triggered on a ferry. I started getting auditory hallucinations, empty house people calling my name, a baby crying and whispering conversations.
Walking, shadow people would point and stare. 
That was last year 

And this year, now I’ve spent the last I’m not sure but it seems long time but I cannot keep track anymore. I’m watched, followed, they’re reading my mind and waiting for my guard to be down. I keep seeing and hearing things others don’t and I’m just so scared even though I know this is me, that in reality I am safe. My brain is stuck in a thick fog and I cannot speak and think normally. 

This week I had an unusual experience where my hand went numb and then my tongue and eyes and I saw this shining person, the opposite of a shadow person reaching out to me. I was speaking trying to talk to my partner but my words were coming out jumbled or swapped. It wasn’t a stroke, CT came out clear.

I hate feeling this way, that I cannot trust what I see, hear or feel.

"Help with information retention when reading - what works? Hi all,

I'm 28 and I manage my ADHD fairly well for the most part with medication, therapy, meditation, and having had about fifteen years to figure out what kinds of systems work for me. That said, between having ADHD and generally being an EXTREMELY ONLINE person, I've noticed over the past few years - particularly since getting out of college - that my ability to retain information from books I've read is completely shot. I love reading, tested very well for it in school, and I have tons of books piling up on my shelf that I've been avoiding because I know I won't remember the key bits anyway. Fiction, I'll remember bits and pieces of the main story for a few months afterward, but I also like to read a lot of non-fiction, and I've gone through huge, well-written non-fiction books and come away feeling like I haven't learned a thing because my brain wouldn't hold on to the info.

I'm sure other folks have experienced this, and to y'all I'd like to ask: have you found anything that helped in this regard?

"I need to vent and cry, but the problems seem so minor from the outside looking in. I'm just gonna let it all out here. I don't care if it doesn't get seen. I got out of a halfway house about 3 weeks ago. A week and a half ago, my girlfriend broke up with me (i'm still madly in love and was very blindsided by this), and two days ago I lost my job. I've been talking to my sponsor and a couple other about it  but it's SO HARD. Everyone experiences breakups and they suck for everyone, but my emotions were already really sensitive due to moving out of the halfway. But i've seen people deal with break ups yet somehow power through. I don't get it. I feel broken and lost. It doesn't help that this is my first sober relationship and I lost my virginity to her. And she seems to have moved on SO fast. I wake up every day feeling sick to my stomach, and ho estly, even in the worst parts of my addiction, I never felt this bad. I see now why they say to not get into a relationship in early recovery. This girl became my new drug. I'd rather go through withdrawals all over again than have to feel the withdrawals from her. And THEN I lost my job! And it was because I made an honest mistake that it was comoany policy that I get fired for! As if I don't feel rejected enough already. Fuck. I feel broken. I feel lost. Last night I didn't get a second of sleep and it's almost midnight and I still feel like I won't be sleeping for a while.

I'm trying to make the most of it though. I've been calling people in my network now more than ever and have built up my bond with my sponsor through this process.

"Looking for advice on finding the right psychiatrist/psychologist Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have gone to therapy once so far and I didn't really like the experience. The walls were extremely thin and there was a another individual waiting for their appointment at the start of mine, so I felt extremely uncomfortable talking but wasn't able to bring that up. It was probably just a coincidence, but it definitely made it hard to open up. Besides that, after talking with them I was reassured that my symptoms are very mildly on the spectrum and that I should just keep an eye on how things progress. On a day-to-day basis, I can tell myself that the thoughts I am having are ridiculous and not plausible at all. It rarely gets to a point that I can't deflect those thoughts and they really affect me.

"[TW] Ladies- have you ever had noticeable changes in your period due to your ED? Advice/input? I’m 24. Without unnecessary detail I’m going to briefly describe my experience with my ED as I feel it may be pertinent to my issue.

I started purging when I was about 15-16. It was *very* sporadic. Usually just when I was having a bad day and felt I ate too much.

Around 19-20 it started becoming more of a couple times a week thing. Still sporadic enough where I didn’t *think* I had an issue.

In the past year or so I started doing it almost daily, and after most meals. I realized recently it’s a big problem and it scared me, so I’ve been on the road to recovery since, but this was all just to give an idea in terms of where my bulimia was at and the relevance to my hormones.

This all being said, idk if it’s because of my ED or other factors, but my period has been seriously out of whack these last couple months. I’ve been on the same pill for a year exactly and these issues just started this summer. This is basically what my cycle has looked like since May/June:

- normal 5 day period May 23-27
- normal 4 day period June 19-23
- early 10 day period July 3-13
- “normal”? 4 day period August 9-13
- early 6 day period August 28-Sept 3
(Spotting between) 
- wayyyyy early 3 day period Sept 6-9
(Still spotting but not heavy)


Could this be in correlation to my ED since it was at its worst in the last year? Has anyone else had period issues due to this? I’m used to having a relatively normal cycle so it’s stressing me out, on top of the potential women’s health issues from having an ED..",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"New boyfriend has Asperger’s Hi! For some back ground, my brother that is three years younger than I has autism.

I just started talking to K on February 4th. We meet on a dating app &amp; everything is going really great. We had our third date yesterday. He is sweet, funny, caring, and thoughtful. He has a 6 year old daughter, where I have a new daughter as well. We have a lot of the same interests &amp; seem to just really be on the same wave length of life! Things are going amazing!

I know that everyone is different, but I would just like a general idea of what to expect. It absolutely does not make a difference to me, I think he’s such a great guy the way that he is.

"Thinking (much too far) ahead I have a brother who is 11 with autism. I am 17 and beginning to look at colleges and I’m beginning to wonder about life after college. A burning question I have is; once my parents are no longer able to care for my autistic brother when either my brother or parents get too old.... what happens to my brother? I haven’t studied the autism spectrum but my brother can talk, but only phrases that he’s heard before on the iPad (which most are bad things to say) and he can communicate his needs. I don’t think he’s going to be able to live on his own. When my  parents aren’t able to care for him, where would he go? Is there a humane place to send him? Or is the only option for him to live with me? And if he lives with me, is there any assistance programs that I can get to help me with caring for him? Or am I completely on my own?  The reason I’m asking this is because, as of now, he has a behavioral issue and is a huge firebrand. He yells angrily all the time and if he is like this later in life, I just don’t want that in my house. Also, he’s borderline obese with no signs of stopping, so chances are I would have to get him healthcare when I get older and I don’t know how it would work and it’s just..... I don’t know.

"DAE hate their weight distribution? First, I’m not trying to become stick skinny. I just want to reach a place where I look slim and healthy. 

The issue is my frame and weight distribution. I have boyish hips, no butt, i have a smaller frame and to top it all off I carry all my extra weight in my trunk. So lots of extra fat in my face, shoulders, back and stomach with sticks for legs and arms.  Despite being a healthy BMI technically, I look pretty fat as a result. I see women my height who weigh even more than I do and they look awesome.... but based on my body type I will absolutely have to reach a very low BMI to look healthy. That means more restriction even though I’ve spent years losing 80 lbs. not an easy task with my predilection for fixating on food and overeating

&amp;#x200B;

So my little sisters drinking problem started last summer, it probably began much earlier but I was unaware from being away at school. Last summer was a very scary time to the point where her life was at risk and where she became aggressive to the point of attempting to hurt me. I was the only person stepping up in my family to get her the help she needed. I tried to get my mom to call the ambulance when my sister was unconscious, I was the one who helped to get her to agree to go to the hospital for detox, I was the one who found the rehab program and supported her to go. I did the best I could to help her. I feel as though our relationship has been crushed and there is no sense of trust or anything. She lied, manipulated me, etc(just an overview, obviously goes much deeper).  She was doing well after she left rehab and went to another group to help integrate her back into society and give her support. After seeing her progress, I let my guard down a little to attempt to rebuild our relationship but it's hard when her program was across the country and being at college. I also just have a lot of anger and resentment for what she did to me and our relationship but I had been trying to work through it.

She recently came back home after being away for so long for a visit and I was hoping that we would be able to repair our relationship a little while she was here. She has now relapsed about 3 times now that I know of and now I literally cannot breath or think or move, it's like I have PTSD from last time and I have just shut down. Last night she came into my room in search of something, I'm assuming that she was looking for alcohol, or maybe even my ID to buy alcohol, who knows. So now I feel even more violated and unsafe in my home. My mom planned hat she was to leave if she relapsed again, but my sister has a way of manipulating my mom so who knows what is going to happen. My mom is no help at all she just invalidates my feelings and enables my sister more.

&amp;#x200B;

The main point in all of this is how do you deal with this? I feel so shut down, so anxious that I can't even function. I was up until 6am last night due to just being so stressed and unable to calm down. Do I try and talk to her? Do I just ignore her as if she doesn't exist? I just don't know how to deal with it and how to not let it impact me to this extent.

"Got a dui a couple of weeks ago and I think it was a blessing in disguise. Just a really expensive one. I’m 28 and if I can remember correctly I’ve been drinking regularly almost every day since I was about 16 or so. It started off as fun like it does for most people but just turned into something I did everyday like having coffee every morning. I’ve wanted to stop for a while but the whole “you’re hurting yourself” argument never really worked because I feel like I’ve developed some sort of death wish. Not trying to sound like woe is me, but things haven’t seem very bright for me for what seems like ever. 

These past few months seemed like they started to get increasingly worse. I had just officially moved out on my own just a couple of months ago (I know it was later than most people) and I started to drink cheap whiskey by the 5ths like Kentucky tavern. Since it was so cheap I was able to buy a lot so I started drinking more and more. Within the couple weeks that I have moved out I have left food on my stove while on 3 times. Everyday felt excruciating to get out of bed. I was constantly late to work. Luckily I work at a place where they just shook their heads when I would come in an hour and a half late. 

It’s been around two weeks since it happened and this is the longest I’ve been sober in a really long time. I’ll admit I think I feel better. Within the past year or so I decided to start making music again. I started uploading my stuff to places like YouTube and Bandcamp. Even though it’s only been a couple of weeks I feel like I’ve been able to come and really focus on my project and see small and encouraging results. I don’t pass out too early while I’m in the middle of working on a song. 

I was really scared that I would lose my voice. Some of my better received works were the ones where I was barely conscious in an almost fever dream state. When I would drink even though it was bad the way I would find inspiration was something that I miss. I sit down, drink and try to go to the deepest and darkest depths of my mind to find what I needed to write. The only way I can explain it is like it was a portal that I only had access to. Almost like a Alice in wonderland thing. The place I would enter was terrible and filled with horrible things but it was familiar. I knew the color of the walls and the beings that lived there. It felt familiar.

"Presenting with primarily negative and cognitive symptoms? CW: references to possibly triggering thoughts

Something's been wrong with me for the last 3 years, could it be schizophrenia? I've developed very significant attention, memory, and processing problems and am in a confused haze for most of the day. I am barely holding on in my role as a grad student, struggle to understand what's going on around me much of the time and my social abilities have completely atrophied (very much die to the fact that I can no longer follow conversations). At its worst, the whole day I'm just in an intensely diminished, slightly giddy state while my thoughts are totally a broken record of white noise, urges to make strange noises, and random phrases built out of the words ""gay,"" ""rape"", and the n-word. I often have staring spells involuntarily and sometimes freeze in the middle of walking for no apparent reason.

 My ""positive symptoms"" have been hypochondriacal delusions and obsessive thinking mostly. For example, when my symptoms began 3 years ago, I had lots of muscle twitching and became convinced I had ALS. This improved on an SSRI, but the thinking problems and social withdrawal did not. Recently I had an exacerbation after a trial of Wellbutrin where I grew worried I was becoming a murderer-rapist-pedophile. I began to feel semi convinced there was a demon inside me trying to get me to give into these impulses. When I looked at mirrors, the ""demon"" tried to make me grin evilly to succumb to my inner evil. I knew throughout that that wasn't literally true, and rather the issue was a combination of this weird ""unhinged"" mood state and an overwhelming and seemingly well founded fear that I *wanted* to rape and murder children. That feeling has thankfully passed, but I'm unsure if the want itself was real or a delusion. (In general I feel very confused about who I am/what I want, often just don't want anything and would be content to stare at a wall for hours.)  I've described all of this to an evaluator at an early psychosis clinic, but they weren't able to diagnose me with anything. 

Does what I've described resonate with anyone here? My life is really falling apart and any help/support would be really appreciated. I'm scared and confused and want to know what's wrong with me.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"I had a flashback. I don't want to self diagnose, I hate it.  Ptsd has become the darling diagnosis for people who want others to feel sorry for them.  I had a flashback though, it was scary.  I heard my friend arguing with her ex-husband and it was just like me and my ex.  She was calm, he was aggressive.  I was always calm, my ex was always aggressive.  My brain jumped to 22 years ago the next day, told me that I could be ok, I would just have to be strong, I just have to keep the kids safe and get them away from her.  The other half of my brain said ""Wait what?  your kids are grown, they're safe, what are you worried about?""    

I've never experienced anything like it, it was out of my control, like my mind running away with a scenario from 20+ years ago.  I'm going to see a counselor as soon as I can.  I've had friends tell me that I may have some ptsd to look into.  It would explain my massive amounts of anxiety over the past 20+ years.  I spent 6 years in an abusive relationship and I might be just starting to realize I've got some scarring from it.  I'm not talking just one event, I'm talking 6 years of having my children's love for me used against me, the scenario of feeling completely helpless and needing to be strong was with me almost the whole time, after 6 years of that, it takes a toll on your psyche.",ptsd,ptsd

"ADHD LPT: Go to medication manufacturers' websites to look for coupons for your prescriptions. Eyyyy guys!  I've only tried this in the USA, but that seems to be where we need the most help with medical expenses.

When I filled my first prescription, the pharmacist suggested I look online for a coupon.  The specific company for Vyvanse is Shire ADHD and I was able to find a coupon that knocks off a significant portion of the cost for each prescription for the next year.

"Spouse with PTSD advice Hi guys, so long story short this past Monday my husband was held at gun point and robbed by two men while at work. Since they took everything he had, I’m handling the insurance claims and ordering new cards, etc. and he actually felt fine enough to go back to work so he went the next day and today. While he was at work my paranoia was through the roof. I was constantly worrying, I couldn’t focus, and had several panic attacks and he was joking around about it as if it was a funny story instead of a traumatic event.

Tonight everything changed, he had a mental breakdown while driving home and talked about how everything hit him. I’m trying to be supportive but he brought up the point that I’m handling it worse than he is and he finds it “funny.” Then he stopped and now he’s fine and joking around on the phone with his friend from college. I know that it was just the calm before the storm but he does bring up a good point, I tried to hide my fear and not let him see it but in result I think it may have made things worse.

"Paranoia about Being Bullied Again So I took CBD today and it calmed me down mentally to allow me to be more conscious of all the thoughts I have. I realized (what I already knew, but now more so than before) that I always feel like people are laughing at me and judging me. I noticed that when I was walking on the sidewalk today that I had all this mental dialogue going on (almost like schizophrenia) hearing all the imagined voices of the people driving past me making fun of me and laughing at me. Laughing at what I wore, laughing at my face, laughing at my walk. I was afraid that one of them would be someone I knew or worse, one of the people who bullied me.

So for the first time I truly acknowledged my anxiety and asked why I felt this way....by doing so I confirmed a belief I previously only partly held.

*It is that because I was bullied by so many people (like 15) (ostracized, yelled at, made fun of and told constantly that no one liked me) that it must have been my fault, or else why would so many people mistreat me and even the ones that didnt partake just allow the abuse to happen and even become friends with these people? If they were really doing something wrong surely no one would willingly befriend bullies or not stand up to them when it happened everyday right? Because everyone knew it was going on, they all saw. It must be my fault of this allowed to happen. So I thought that since I caused it, there is something about me that will cause this to happen with other people aswell. Thus i see everyone as a potential bully, and no self talk changed the anxiety when I was out today***

I saw someone I knew and though she smiled at me I shut down and after our conversation I just wanted to go home and I wasn’t even present the entire time, my mind kept going back to memories of being yelled at and made fun of the whole conversation even though she was laughing with me. I kept going numb because I felt like if I emotionally checked out, then any bullying that I expected on her part wouldn’t affect me because I wasn’t emotionally there in the first place. All of which I became aware of is something that always happens but cbd made me more conscious of it, it made me more conscious of things that had already been there but I just ignored/I had been denying because I didn’t want to accept that I was mentally ill. 

So how do I, I guess stop thinking that I was at fault for being bullied, or even if I WAS doing something wrong that they just exaggerated my flaws and that I am not a monster that will just be rejected and made fun of by everyone across the board?",ptsd,ptsd
"Starting tomorrow! Hi all!  I am a 33 yo woman and I am starting on Adderall tomorrow morning.  I am a little nervous and don't really know what to expect.

A little backstory:

I started with a new doctor about a year ago and she has helped me tremendously.  She first brought ADHD to me a while back, but I dismissed the idea.  It had never been suggested before, and I erroneously thought that it looked like it does on TV.  In December I started on a new medication for an unrelated issue.  Suddenly, I felt.... pleasantly weighed and slowed down.  For the first week, I felt like my words were sort of getting caught in my mouth and I was even getting frustrated.  My husband told me, though, that I was speaking at a normal rate for the first time in the 15 years he's known me.  When I brought my concerns to my doctor she just looked at me and said, ""Yes, it has that effect on people with ADHD.""

I had a few months left on that medication and I couldn't combine it with Adderall.  But now I am picking it up tomorrow.  Yesterday I searched for my wallet for 30 minutes and this morning I brewed coffee without putting a cup underneath. I used to do things such as that all the time.  Seriously, ALL THE TIME.  But it all stopped (mostly) when I was on the medication.

So I am very excited about tomorrow, even if I am a little nervous, too.

TL;DR - Never thought I had ADHD, doctor and (non-ADHD) medication convinced me otherwise.  Start on Adderall tomorrow morning.",adhd,adhd

"8 Months Tomorrow... I started drinking in college where it was a lot more socially acceptable to abuse alcohol.  After college, I joined the military and graduated to drinking by myself all the time.  I would quit during deployments and stay sober for anywhere from 3-6 months (we had short deployments) out of the year.  Towards the end of my time in the military, I didn't deploy nearly as much, so I ended up drinking a lot more.  I didn't consider myself an ""alcoholic"" because I wouldn't get up and drink in the mornings, I didn't drink every day, and I never had any withdrawal symptoms when I would stop drinking for weeks or days at a time (or when I deployed for months).

Anyway, in my heavier drinking days I would put away 10+ drinks a night.  I think the most I ever got to was 14 in one night, which might have just been the highest I could count when I was that drunk.  I wouldn't do this every night.  Maybe once or twice a week.  It was not uncommon to buy a handle of whiskey Friday night and have it be gone by Monday morning.  I didn't have friends or anything else to do, so I'd basically go home and drink and play video games until I was too drunk to function and then go to bed.

I began noticing my left arm felt like it was asleep when I woke up in the mornings after a heavy night.  I figured I had just slept on it wrong, but then it started to stay like that for longer during the day.  One day I had the sudden realization that it was alcoholic neuropathy and I was doing permanent damage to my central nervous system.  I stopped binge drinking, but I still didn't quit drinking though.  I had to ""make sure"" it was alcohol and not something else.  It took me months of being ""throttled back"" to see if I could get those symptoms to go away before I said enough was enough and quit once and for all.

Tomorrow that will have been 8 months ago.  I can still feel some nerve damage in my arm sometimes, just a mild barely noticeable sensation.  I've been taking multivitamins that are supposed to help with brain and nerve function (niacin, folate, B's), but they aren't helping at all.  I can't be an alcoholic and do my job, so I'm afraid I'll lose my job if I go to a doctor for help. I haven't told my family either.  They know I don't drink and they don't try and make me or ask why.

I've really had no problem being sober.  I'm not tempted to drink again, even when other people are drinking around me.  It's kind of great, actually.  I've lost a lot of weight, saved who knows how much money, and have so much more free time now!  Now I'm just worried about all the damage I did to my body.  I'm worried this nerve damage will never go away, or that my liver will quit on me, or that I'll wake up with stomach cancer one day, or who knows what else.

I don't really know why I'm posting this.  Does anybody know anything about alcoholic neuropathy or how I can recover from that?

"Am I allowed a wall of rant? Former exec who coped turned couchsurfer. Three weeks in on Concerta. 
I am old. I don't feel old but the calendar says otherwise. I have lived what I used to think was a life of adventure. Crazy stuff that I just get away with. Cool stories that are just too wild to be true and that everyone assumes I am exaggerating, even when I am leaving out the really wild shit.  But some of it was stupid and impulsive. And empty in ways. But it never went to coke or other things. Some pot. Some wine. Lots of sports and social stuff and saying yes to whatever was in front of me. So that part was good. It kept my body strong. It could have gone the other way. Lemonade coming up.

I'm probably the kind of person you want at your side when the zombies are at the door. But I never understood why everyone didn't always see zombies at the door. Or go looking for kindling to set alight. Or cut a corner just because it was somehow impossible to do it the easy way. The easy way that would have been the first choice of anyone else but no I gotta do it the hard way and then spend 30 years worrying about it. So stupid. 

Pity parties suck. Or so said my eldest daughter. Also eldest child. And the one who has coped the best. And I agree with her. What sucks worse is the decades of pity parties. The lost opportunities. The love and trust that was lost. The genuine bewilderment when those around you don't see how you are trying to help. The vague sense of sadness when you invest a full day of effort into something and you're still not sure if anyone liked it. And no one will tell you in words you can understand. But you know they liked it and when you break down and ask them to please tell you they liked it and say it in these words so I know you mean it and they get mad and then you feel that they really don't like it. Or you. 

And then you do something awesome the next day and they say a casual thank you that connects and you know that they liked it. But it still doesn't feel any different but at least you know.

"Depressed 16-year-old aspie, extremely dysfunctional family. Is there no hope left for my life? (very long) Hi, I'm a 16-year-old with Aspergers, and my family is killing me on the inside. Apologies in advance for the very long post, and I understand if you don't want to read it all. Firstly, *some background information*:

Four kids, age gap as large as 10 years; youngest is 6, oldest is me at 16. In the middle are a 9-year-old and 14-year-old. My primary autistic issue (most strongly affecting me on a day-to-day basis) is SPD, *especially* sound. All of my siblings also seem to have some form of high-functioning autism, however none of them appear to be affected by any sort of SPD whatsoever.

Much younger, up until around 10, I was enrolled in public school. Various issues (I'd prefer to not go into detail) resulted in me eventually becoming homeschooled, as well as my other sibling who was 8 at the time. After this point, none of my other siblings ever touched public school at any point, and were only homeschooled. Things weren't going *too* bad at this point.

**This brings us to present day.**

My parents eventually, slowly over time, did less and less traditional homeschooling, until it was completely dropped. Unconsciously resulting in me, also unconsciously, trying to unschool myself (I had no idea what it was until recently). So as of right now, all of us simply wake up... then do whatever, until we sleep and repeat. No obligations whatsoever.

Now for me personally, this is great, as I'm trying to actively put in a huge amount of effort to learn and develop useful skills everyday. With this kind of free time, and tests etc. not taking up my brain, I could master something in a fraction of the time it would take others, and I'm trying to take full advantage of that and be productive (instead of doing things like playing video games constantly).

**However, this is also where big problems come into play.**

What do my siblings do all day? The 2 middle siblings: they play video games, and they watch YouTube. I shit you not, that's *quite literally* all they do. Wake up, eat, video games, YouTube, eat, video games, YouTube... sleep. Repeat, every day, for the past ~20 months or so. As for the youngest (6), he acts more like a 4-year-old. He gets what he wants a lot of the time, because when he doesn't (or he faces a minor inconvenience on a phone game or something), he screams and cries as loud as possible. My mother is quite fond of ""he's just a baby"" and ""there's nothing we can do about it, we can't control him.""

I've tried talking to my siblings. ""What are you going to do when you're an adult?"", a simple ""I don't know"" is usually all I can get out of them. They show zero desire to be productive or even try to learn any skills (they mostly just have knowledge of YouTubers or games they play), no amount of suggestion or incentive has helped at all. But they somehow show unlimited desire to rage at games, and then stomp around the fucking house because they're mad. They also like to ""play,"" where ""playing"" is running around everywhere with toys, while yelling random crap at eachother as loud as they can and laughing their asses off as they jump and run super quickly into walls like chimpanzees. I get the same ""I can't control them"" and ""kids need to play, *that's their job*!"" responses from my mother when I ask them to be quieter or stop when they're ""playing."" Keep in mind I am talking not only about the 6-year-old, but the 9 and 14-year-olds do this too. Often when they're not ""playing,"" they're instigating some response out of the 6-year-old that will make him scream, or screaming themselves about something he does.

I have continually and consistently drilled into my entire family's heads the fact that I am very sensitive to noise, vibrations, thumps... to no avail. My parents are completely aware that I have Aspergers, they just refuse to put effort into any sort of accommodation that isn't so easy and effortless it could be done and over with in 2 minutes. Dare I ever complain about noise, *I'm the one who gets told to ""shut up,""* while everyone else continues to be as loud and annoying as they like. Their ""normal talking"" voices I'm pretty damn sure are at least 10-20% louder than an actual normal human being's talking volume. Even the most casual of conversation is at least a half-yell that can be heard across the entire 2-floor house, and dear God when they angrily start actually yelling back and forth at eachother, I genuinely want to fucking die or at least have my ears chopped off. When they leave or enter a room (which is pretty often) they either slam it so hard it shakes the whole house or they leave it open (despite VERY consistent and long-term attempts at asking them to just keep their doors closed), and then proceed to be loud from inside the room. When they are watching a movie or ""adult"" TV show (at least once a day), they put the SUBWOOFER really loud, and almost every time I have to ask them to turn it down a lot. They say they ""turn it down"" but even then I'm usually still getting intermittently assaulted by intense vibrations in my entire body until 1-2 hours later.

I go upstairs, close the door, and put on my thick headphones that are supposed to block noise, which I purchased myself earlier this year. I turn on some music, and if I'm really lucky they'll be quiet enough that I have 20-30 minutes of peace at a time. On average (and yes I have actually documented interrputions at one point) there is some loud noise (passes through medium-volume music in big headphones) every 11 minutes of the day, and that's not counting things like subwoofer. I don't count this either but they also intermittently ""check on me,"" whether that's walking by and yelling very loud ""Hello imscrewed69"" and getting extremely annoyed if I don't answer back (yes I've asked them not to do this several times), or by sneaking up and opening the door as fast as they can look at my screen and say ""what are you doing?"" I don't even have a history of hiding things, but to be honest I'm really quite scared of them finding some mundane things:

**Not allowed.**

I have some friends I play video games with and I can't talk to them with my voice at all unless it's an occasional whisper, because last time I tried that (years ago) I was FORCED to remove every single person from my Steam friends list permanently while I cried my eyes out, and I'm still really pissed since I haven't found them since :(. So I basically only have a few super secret internet friends, I don't know a single person outside of family in real life. If they found this post (I've fuzzed a few specifics/minor details) I would be in some deep shit. Keep in mind EVERYTHING I am saying here is either 100% truth or at most very slightly exaggerated. I have to put up a squeaky-clean facade.I act like I don't know anything that's currently going on in the world. I wouldn't be allowed to ready *any* form of regular news, see anything with any sort of sexual undertones, sexual references, or swear words. *I didn't even own a phone* until very recently, they got one for me only to be used to call them if they are out of the house. I STILL don't have an e-mail (that they know of), I'm not allowed and if they ""let"" me have one they would monitor it closely. They genuinely think I don't know about any of that stuff and I'm fucking scared what would happen if they found out.

**My parents and family don't physically hurt me or eachother. But I can't say the same for the mental/psychological side, intentional or not.**

I try to ""just do it."" I try to work through the absolute insanity I'm exposed to everyday. I've tried to ""just ignore it"" (one of my mother's favorites) time and time again, it DOESN'T WORK. Every time I feel the slightest bit of motivation, feel energy in myself because I want to learn something or get something done... it gets instantly crushed when I remember the fact that most likely 5-10 minutes into working there's gonna be a 10-minute yelling fight or something. I dare try to ignore that thought and, 9 times out of 10, it ends up happening anyway and all the energy is sucked away. My mind goes blank. It becomes an empty void. I can't think straight. I can only feel some kind of intense mental, almost physical but not quite, *pain*. My body is telling me to not subject myself to inevitable the sharp pain and sudden spike of intense fear and adrenaline, of slowly slipping into focus only to be metaphorically shoved off a cliff when someone throws a giant toy at the fucking wall. I've put all of my projects off. I can get some work done but in very short bursts, in very small parts of the day. Usually when I just get lucky and manage to scrounge up enough effort to get started and for once it doesn't come crashing down in the first 10 minutes. When my parents and youngest (or better yet, all of them) are gone to the store or something, and they leave me alone, I experience a high, a pleasurable feeling like no other, it feels like the very essence of *freedom*. Where I'm able slip into true focus and get so much done it's not even funny. I finally don't have to feel 1,000 butterflies in my stomach when I dare try to work on something that requires an ounce of focus or brainpower. I finally don't have to crank up loud music long-term ear-damage levels and hope the youngest randomly shrieking at his phone game for no goddamn reason doesn't overpower it. When they're here with me, as batshit insane as ever, the fight-or-flight feeling doesn't want to go away.

**Closing.**

I have skills that I want to learn. I want to dedicate my large amount of """"""""free"""""""" time to them, take advantage of what is *almost* a decent situation. But I just *can't*. Reading about and deliberately practicing something for 10 minutes, and then having it abruptly end to God knows what it could be this time, is extremely harmful to the ability to absorb, process, store, and truly understand the information. Not to mention that I've been conditioned to be constantly on edge, and the fear of interruption taking up precious memory space.

Do I have depression? I really think I might, I put it in the title, I know feeling this way isn't normal. I think a little bit about suicide sometimes but never in detail or plans, or that often, I really don't want to ever do that. Even if I am depressed, my parents would have a field day with another thing to tell me is ""just in my head,"" that I ""have control over"" and about how it's ""NOT OK to be mentally ill."" Even if I took anti-depressants or adhd meds or anything like that (but not in a million years would my parents go down any path resulting in those) I doubt they would have any real, measurable effect on most aspects of the complex situation at hand.

I want to move out. But I'm only 16. I'm just about capable of small-medium freelancing jobs skill-wise, and what I'm trying to do is build new skills and further my current ones through deliberate practice and learning. It will help me be skilled enough to make some money and hopefully finally be able to live by myself. But my situation is stopping me dead in my tracks. I can't move out because I'm 16 and *not quite well-rounded enough yet*, but I can't meaningfully *learn and develop more skill* at a fast enough pace *because of* my shitty situation that I'm trying to escape.

*The end.*

I apologize for the long rant-y wall of text. I've never told anyone about my situation at all, not even the slightest detail. I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish by making this post, I don't know if you can help me, but a sincere thank you for reading.

"How can I prevent myself from acting on delusions? I'm 18M, and I'm a major burden on my older brother, who is giving up his life to make sure I'm taken care of.

Since I was 12, I've believed a lot of religious themed delusions, such as demonic possession and ghosts haunting my mother's house.

I started hearing voices a year ago that gave me a prophecy for how to defeat a 10,000 year old demon, and they told me it was my sacred destiny to do so. I have notebooks filled with a ""prophecy"" that directs me to do dangerous things.

I ran away from home with nothing but the clothes on my back while experiencing psychosis. I said goodbye to my brother who I trust more than anyone else. He was telling me I was delusional and asking me not to leave, but I listened to an auditory hallucination instead of him.

I feel so stupid and worthless. I've tried to develop a more logical worldview. I'm on medication, and I still believe Fate is delivering me prophecies when I get stressed. It doesn't occur to me I'm acting on a delusion until my mood changes.

When he’s sober, he tells me that he knows he’s sick but he can’t afford therapy (which isn’t true, he can but he’s just scared). 

He does a very good job of hiding his alcoholism from his family, and he really doesn’t trust that anyone but me cares about him at this point.

"Help me understand my daughter. She just got diagnosed with moderate autism. She is three years old. Her speech has improved and vocabulary has expanded a lot in the last 6 months. But most of what she says isn't used to actually communicate. She does a lot of echolalia and what i've heard to be described as ""scripting"". She doesn't say ""mom"", ""dad"", ""i want"", ""i am"".... nothing like that. However she can repeat episodes of her favorite show as well as the songs in them word for word. If something similar to a scene from her show happens, she'll use the words from the scene. So for example, when she hugs me she'll say ""oh, clover!"" like the main character says to her animal friend. Or one time she accidently hit me and when I said ow she said, ""sorry boss"" ... like a character on her show said in a scene. So it's confusing that she only says words if she can match them up to a scene or even sometimes a  situation that has happened repeatedly like me telling her good job about doing a certain task, after she does that task she'll say ""good job!"" But the words she knows isn't used spontaneously.

"newly concerned father My 14 year old daughter has symptoms that match schizophrenia. A few months ago, she told us that she felt like she was being watched. We didn't think anything of it. Then she revealed to her mom that she heard a voice call her name and she saw fleeting shadows. I immediately wondered about schizophrenia, but my wife said I was jumping to conclusions. Just this past weekend, my daughter has revealed to us that she has 17 very active voices in her head. She says that some of the voices are much stronger and more aggressive than others. At this point, my daughter is used to the voices and she misses some of them when they are quiet. She has a hard time sleeping, the most intrusive voices tend to come out during bedtime. Occasionally, she has a hard time speaking when the voices are active.

She already sees a therapist and we are now trying to get her in front of a psychiatrist for help. We've called three different psychiatrists and the first open appointments are in February. Man, that's a long time away.

This is a pretty scary time for us. We just have so many questions and so few answers. What does all this mean? Will her symptoms change for the better or worse as she grows older? What can we do to help her? Will she be able to go to college? Will she have a job? What kind of medication will help her? Should we move to another state for better psychiatric care? ... on and on

Anyway, I told her some things about my situation, and I feel like early on she made up her mind that I had mild depression. She recommended I go to therapy and I could try Wellbutrin, an antidepressant. I told her I didn’t feel like I was depressed, and left.

My work and relationships are suffering. I hate my job. I cant stand being at my desk for more than few hours at a time.

My desk is also right next to a printer and a door. Every time someone walks in/out it drives me insane. I think the work itself is boring and mind numbing. I finish it fairly quick. I’ve been day trading the stock market while at work. Overall I feel like I’m wasting my life away, not really making an impact. I feel like it’s killing me slowly. 

I have a lot of hobbies that I rarely touch anymore. I own firearms, a motorcycle and race/track car. I have a lot of ideas about new hobbies, starting a new business, or getting a new degree.  

I constantly fantasize about moving to a different state and start a new job/life.  I only feel alive and calm when I’m working out or hiking.

"Was diagnosed as a kid during elementary school.

I remember having a bad experience with Adderall mostly due to pressure from my mom ($8 a pill when we were tight on money and I had troubles swallowing them) but I remember that they had some effect on me, just not sure what they were. My 5th grade teacher said that my concentration was noticeably different but my memory of that time is too vague.

I grew up never really understanding what ADHD was, it was something like a mix of Autism and overcaffeinated to me and my definition of it is so skewed now. I've also heard that there have been many instances of false diagnosis and so I've never told people that I potentially have ADHD. I guess what I want to know is, what are the symptoms of ADHD and how does it affect mood in general? I've been feeling a dull depression all my life and wanted to know if this ties in with it.

"Is it Alcoholism if it's Social? I drink too much, but I don't drink alone. Is that alcoholism or just normal?

I feel like most people think it means that I don't have a problem, because ""that's just what it's like to be living the student life"". I go to parties or other social activities with alcohol involved 1-2 days a week, and more often that not, that means binge drinking to a point where I can't remember most of the night the day after. Once it got so bad that I had to go to the hospital, because I was throwing up blood, and I woke up with blood and bruises all over without any knowledge of what had happened. I didn't even remember being pushed in a wheel chair to hospital or yelling at my dad when he came to get me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I think this is a problem? I think it's a problem, because: 

a) I don't want to fuck up my health and body, and that's what's happening right now.

b) I often tell myself that I'm only having three beers, but then three beers quickly become 5 beers with drinks and shots on the side.

c) I feel happy when I get drunk, and that's what makes it hard to stop. 

d) I often wake up depressed the day after, especially when I remember feeling happy without any reason - it was just empty happiness, caused by alcohol.

e) I feel embarrassed because of the things I do when I'm drunk. It can be bad stuff, but most of the time it's just crazy fun stuff. I'm embarrassed because I lost control, and even though people think it's funny, I just get embarrassed by the quantity of it. In the beginning it was fun, but now I'm worried because I can't control it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I'm not alone, and it's not that unusual for young people to get that drunk that often. I just think that it's absurd that a story where I almost died becomes a fun anecdote as soon as there's alcohol and other people involved. 

Last Friday, I tried to tell people out loud, that I didn't want to play that drinking game because it was too intense. I asked them if they wanted to play another game less heavy on alcohol (not even alcohol free) - but people just looked at me like I was some kind of weirdo and they just silenced my request to death as if it would go away, if we all forgot as quickly as possible that I had come up with such a ridiculous idea.

"Cannabis &amp; Autism Study - Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia I hope this doesn't violate any rules on this sub.  If so, I apologize and please delete.

I received this email from Dr. Sulak about this study.  I can't vouch for it but if you are already treating your child with cannabis and can help extend our knowledge of how cannabis is helping people with autism that would be great!

&amp;#x200B;

**Cannabis &amp; Autism Study**

My colleagues at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia are conducting a study on cannabis and autism, and we need your help.  If you have a child with an autistic spectrum disorder who’s using cannabis products, please contact Mary Ann Diliberto, RN and complete the survey.  Clinically, I’ve observed several patients with autism respond beautifully to cannabis, and recent data suggests that children with autism may have impaired function in their endocannabinoid system, indicating that cannabinoid therapies may be very appropriate.I know firsthand that parents have limited time, but I also know that we have to work together to move the science forward.  With your help we can better understand how to use cannabis to help the increasing number of children with autistic spectrum disorders.Thanks for your help gathering important scientific data!

**WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THIS OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH STUDY?**

The purpose of this research study is to understand the use of cannabis in children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Information provided will help us to inform future research and develop treatment guidelines for this population.

**WHO CAN BE A PART OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY?**

Children under the age of 18 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder who are currently being treated with cannabis obtained legally. 

**WHAT WILL PARTICIPANTS BE ASKED TO DO?**

Participants are asked to join a confidential registry and provide information on the type of cannabis their child is being treated with. Parents will be asked to complete questionnaires and provide medical background information.

**WHAT WILL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?**

We will provide educational workshops for parents and caregivers to share what we have learned from this observational research study.

**I WANT TO HELP.  WHO DO I CALL?**

"Just quit after 8 years of heavy substance abuse 33m. Tobacco was easy. Cocaine was somehow easier and I was using so much of that daily. Alcohol has been the hardest. Just quit 3 days ago, and the withdrawals today have been crippling to say the least. Holy fucking shit. Was drinking a handle of vodka every two days with beers or wine intertwined. Finally fed up with out I feel daily. Luckily my work is very supportive, and I can work from home when I need to. I knew the nausea would be a thing but the pain was not expected. My 'why' is my girlfriend. I finally have love, real love, and I want to share a better life with her. I'm doing this without support groups bc I do not like many folks. Lucky for me the cravings have subsided and today will stick in my mind forever. Anyone who reads this and is considering doing the same I will say this: stop making excuses. You're not convincing anyone except yourself. And you can't trust yourself. I'm lucky. Good luck to all you people going through this shit. ",alcoholism,alcoholism
"How did your doctor diagnose you with ADHD? Starting in my 20’s, I began noticing it was getting more and more challenging to concentrate at work. I would take frequent breaks in order to reset myself but all those breaks caused my productivity to go way down. I never had problem concentrating in school so I never thought I had ADHD until I randomly came across an article online about adult ADHD. After reading this article and researching symptoms and knowing that adderall helps with concentration, I decided to see a psychiatrist and get a diagnosis. The psychiatrist diagnosed me by having me fill out a questionnaire that looked like it had been poorly photocopied a thousand times that asked me generic questions about my concentration and if I get bored easily. And just based on that questionnaire, he diagnosed me with having ADHD and prescribed me adderall. I thought that was way too quick and easy of a diagnosis. It made me think this doctor didn’t care if I truly had ADHD or not and just thought I was trying to get an adderall prescription and so he could get a new patient and make more money. A few years later I visited a different doctor for a diagnosis and she had me fill out the exact same questionnaire and immediately prescribed me just like the previous doctor did. 

Did anyone else get diagnosed like this? How did you get diagnosed?

TL;DR My psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADHD just by having me fill out a questionnaire. I think this was way too fast and easy of a way to diagnose someone. ",adhd,adhd

"Can't concentrate in my class after an hour of listening to the teacher etc. Hey everyone! 
I recently started my apprenticeship as an IT-Specialist.
I relly love it so far, but the only downside is my class at vocational school! 
Lets say the teacher explains an at the beginning easy to understand topic, but after a while it gets more and more complicated. 
I don't have any problems with that so far. 
The most disturbing thing is, that about five to seven people are constantly, you heard right, all the time, talking and shouting around etc.

Well, now my problem is, that I get into concentrational problem after maximum 90 minutes, as I get disorientated, dizzy, angry, tired and then I can't pay any attention to the teacher or whatever we have to do!! 

Our teacher knows that I'm autistic. 
He already told the other students in the class that they should keep quiet as he talks! 
But they really wont stop!! 
Our english teacher also, almost had to scream at them, because he cant teach us whilst theyre talking!

I was a little older but to me she was the girl I was going to ask to marry me. We did everything together and there was not one bad time I ever had with her. Everything to me was perfect. I loved her so much...still do. But something happened and I stabbed my dad in 2009 because I thought he was trying to take her away from me. I was looking at 50 years but got lucky. I called her from jail one night and she told me she had a new boyfriend. I hung up. I didnt tell her how much I loved her or why I was there. I let her go. But she stayed in my mind. We never touched. We never kissed. But I know there was a time she wanted to. I left her once before because I wasnt sure if I would get sick or not. And it turns out I did. When i came back to the state she was in. I told her I had been with another girl...while we were apart. I was drunk and didnt think to call her. I thought i was telling my bestfriend. She started calling me a gay fag and other bad names. When wed go for drives around the town. I never argued with her. I was so hurt that id hurt her. Thats when I stabbed my dad and things with her fell apart. I dont even know if she ever knew I was sick then, but I think she might have. Id reach out to her a couple of times throughout the years and shed tell me to leave her alone or that she was married. So I did. Until I had a daughter in 2015 that is a spitting image of her. The only girl ive been with in the last ten years resembled my friend better than anyone I had ever met. Same heritage (native) same handedness (lefties). I reached out to my friend from years ago and told her I hope my daughter is as beautiful as you are someday. We talked a little. Within the last year we have talked a little more and she has told me she always wanted me and that she will always love me. I used to tell her to be older kiddo, because I was going to ask her to marry me. Shes gone distant on me again. And it seems like her heart has hardend towards me.

"Update after almost a year It's been a while since I have posted in here, and I hope that this doesn't come off as bragging because I know the struggles of progressively getting worse all too well.

&amp;#x200B;

I am nearing the 1 year mark from the last hallucination. Within a month, I am seeing my psych and working with her to lower my dose of Latuda (currently 160mg/day). I have already eliminated the small dose of Haldol that I had gone on a year ago due to the hallucinations.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that everyone is probably sick of hearing it, but I really do believe that this is all because of changes to my diet. I have been following a paleo/primal version of keto since April 2018. I dropped 40lb, lowered my cholesterol, and am getting better with regards to my psychosis. I specify that I follow primal because it means that I don't eat vegetable oil or any other unnatural foods. I typically eat tuna &amp; sardine salad made with avocado oil mayo for lunch. So, I am covering all my bases by increasing omega 3 as well as eliminating processed food.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as exercise goes, I run long distances at a low-effort level. This took time to get to a reasonable pace and had to start out simply by walking to maintain the target heartrate that I follow (180-my age: 147bpm).

"On switching jobs, feeling overwhelmed, having a plan and a bunch of other stuff These last few days have been really rough. I feel so overwhelmed that I got my first stiff neck.

---

_NOTE: This is gonna be long, but there's a TL;DR at the end._

---

The reason? Because I'm moving to another state in order to start a new job. It's been roughly two and a half weeks since they made me the offer, and through all this time I was 100% sure it was not going to work. Somehow things would get fucked.

Things could get fucked in so many ways. I did not have all the documents. I would not manage to get through the process. I would not return to my apartment in time. I would fail to get in time. I had my car to fix, stuff to pack, the project at current work to handle. I have to figure out what's going to happen between me and my girlfriend. And so many other things related and unrelated to all of that. There was no time, and I had no experience doing this, and I was sure I would screw it up.

But somehow, I do not really know how, things seem to be working out! Just today I finally started to believe that things are gonna work. I clarified some points with the HR people, made some appointments, laid out some minor details of the plan and realized that as of now I have 15 days in my hands and most things are already resolved or forwarded, only waiting to be solved.

Now, I know people usually get nervous about big changes like this, but I didn't just get nervous. I got fucking overwhelmed, paralyzed. All I wanted was to lay in bed, smoke weed and sleep. My routine went to the window, I lost control over my focus, couldn't plan nor follow what was planned. Some times I just laid in bed and spent the day stoned. I wanted to give up on all of this (including my current job and my GF - like wtf? what did they had to do with it, lol?) for every single moment of this journey. I really don't know how I managed not to.

This is no way of living. Why am I like this? I'm sure that if this had happened 5 months ago, before I knew about ADHD and how important my mental health is, I would have blew it up. I would have lost my shit. I just couldn't manage stuff like this. I would overthink every little step of the process, get trapped in some mood swing, give up and get frustrated and then depressed.

So yeah, thanks you all for your support, thanks for the tips, talks about making lists and being organized, thanks for all the encouragement I pulled from this sub and from people in my life, thanks to my GF for being supportive, thanks for everyone who helped me get through this shit. And thanks to my fishy psychologist (who I'm always talking shit about) for giving me some key pointers during this process. I wouldn't have made without you all.

I still feel like things could go south at any moment, that's for sure. But I have done everything I could so far, and I'm really proud of that. And really, I have no reason to feel like this, so I can just deal with it and keep going.

So im 17 and I had a spinal AVM So about a year ago (September 18th to be exact) I was having some back pain. That pain escalated and after i tried getting up my legs weren't able to hold my body weight. After my dad tried to help me move around thinking it was a pinched nerve and he ended up getting me to the couch. He had me moving my legs up and down like i was marching while sitting hoping that would do something but all it did was keep me focused on the fact that more time went on the less i was able to use my legs and the less i could feel them at all. It happened in the spand of an hour. But i was off to the hospital and that kinda fades in and out. The last thing i remember was that damned room right before you go into surgery. Next thing i know is that im in urgent care and i cant feel my legs or move them at all. I have about a 6 inch incision on my back witb staples in and my family are in the room waiting for me to wake up. Fast forward to now. Im walkin and my feeling is not exactly up to par but its way better than what it was. Im coming up on the anniversary of it and I've been losing sleep rewatching everything that happened.

"Schizophrenia Vs. Traumatized? To preface, I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia previously, but recently I got a completely new care team and psychiatrist as my old care provider thought it would be better to transfer me to a new place for better resources.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally met the psychiatrist and had my first session with her. She wanted to do a full assessment of me again, and started the first session with just asking me background questions like where I live, who I live with, what school I go to, etc. We talked a little bit about my positive symptoms, mostly my hallucinations. We didn't get very far in because of appointment time constraints, but at least changed my antipsychotics a bit for me and sent me off.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, I finally had my second session with her, and I went in expecting the assessment to continue but it...didn't. Instead she sat me down and told me she read through all of the previous reports from professionals I have seen in the past, and she told me that she doesn't think I'm schizophrenic at all. Instead, she said she just thinks I'm traumatized.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that trauma can make psychotic symptoms happen but that those psychotic symptoms will not improve with any medication or psychosis-specific help like CBT for psychosis, and told me that I ""do not have true psychosis"". Following this, she told me to stop taking all of my antipsychotics completely, and told me that she is transferring all my services to a team that is better suited to doing trauma therapy only. She told me to stop going to psychosis help groups. She told me to stop working on psychosis-specific CBT skills with my case worker. (Additionally, my case worker was there, and fully agreed with all these decisions.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am...confused? A little overwhelmed? Does anybody know anything about this? I absolutely do not feel comfortable being taken off my medication so suddenly like this - especially when they *do* help my symptoms - and I voiced this, but the psychiatrist was adamant that medication will not help me and that I must stop taking them.

"DAE hate taking meds? how can i convince my doctors to let me quit meds? as titled i guess. 

i'm taking three things right now to cope with the hallucinations (and depression). Abilify 30 mg, Wellbutrin 150 mg, and Quetiapine 50 mg. these aren't even the highest dosages i've been on, but i'm really resistant to increasing the dosages any more. 

basically when i'm on any meds i don't feel like myself AT ALL. my thoughts are put there by someone. my feelings are degrees removed from my body. my actions are being controlled by SOMEONE. i don't know who. 

i'm also really scared that i will hurt myself in ways to which i don't intend. i self-harm obviously but i'm scared that i would go too far without adequate preparations because i'm not in control. for example, i could jump off of the building before writing a note, formatting my phone, or something equally inane/idiotic/performative. 

when i tell my health professionals this stuff they just increase my dosage. i have tried all meds i think that don't mess with my appetite because of my eating disorder. i would rather be off my meds for good but my doctors are not convinced... what should i say to them?

"My stepfather(59M) is an alcoholic. I hope this is the right place to put this.

My stepfather is an alcoholic. He’s been in my life since I was 8 years old, I am now 22. As long as I can remember he has been an alcoholic. His daily routine when he isn’t working is to leave the house at around 9am and go straight to the pub and come home around 4 or 5pm absolutely legless. When he is working he works away from home and has a good job! My mother is completely blind to his drunken antics now, it’s long been at a point of regular life that she doesn’t care.

My stepfather and I have a very toxic relationship, when he is sober he is the nicest man I’ve ever met. The moment he has some alcohol in his system he becomes a very evil person. Our relationship is all verbal abuse since I was 8. I get called every single name you can think off, I get called “fat, lazy, worthless” and he continues to threaten me with making me homeless or will tell me to kill myself.

I live with my mum and stepfather as I suffer from Crohn’s disease, I have moved out in the past but because of my illness I am unable to care for myself properly and always need to return home when I have a flare up. At the moment I’m constantly ill. My mother has told my stepfather multiple times to stop drinking and get help but will never follow through with her threats of leaving him. My mother works too and doesn’t get home till around 6:30/7pm so I’m always left alone with my stepfather for a few hours of when his drunken rage is at its peak. I’ve been dealing with this for so many years I just can’t take it anymore. My mum is constantly telling him off for shouting at me and the things he says and sometimes he takes it in and will behave and come home reasonable drunk but not drunk enough to shout at me but it’ll last a day or two and he always goes back to him.

I made progress but each time relapsed &amp; lied saying certain weeks at work were causing me to expend more energy (I was a landscape gardener so this was true.. to an extent).

However, it could be anything; maybe I went back outside for another cigarette and got mugged. Maybe I got hit by a car. It's the not knowing that kills me. I'm in a lot of pain. 

 It's crazy that, for all the terrible things drinking has brought to my life, it took fucking up my face for me to realize that I need to go cold turkey. I guess this particular consequence is more real to me than the dozens of friendships and professional relationships I've ruined. Or the two suicide attempts I've made while blacked out. Or the many times I've driven drunk and somehow never hurt anyone. Or the time I went to jail for drinking. Or the time I got my underage sister so drunk she had to get her stomach pumped the day before high school graduation. All the regrettable sexual encounters I've had. 

I'm sick of being disappointed in myself, I'm sick of being embarrassed. I'm devastated that I broke my nose. I feel so out of control. Where do I go from here? I feel so terrified and alone.

"Good gift for someone completing rehab? Hi I hope this type of post is allowed and doesn’t fall under the surveys ban in the rules. I made a throwaway for this as well FYI. My s/o, who I have been with for almost 4 years, is currently in rehab. She had been hiding her alcoholism from me (we don’t live together yet) for awhile and recently her parents discovered her stash and she admitted she had a problem and has been through detox and is now in rehab as I said. Tomorrow she will be 30 days sober!!

I’m extremely proud of her for stepping up and working on the issue. I love this woman and would be devastated if it had consumed her without me knowing. I write her letters and talk to her on the phone when she can call. She seems to be doing very well and has made it clear that she is putting in a lot of effort. She has been exercising more, which is great because she didn’t a lot before, and has been talking about how much more open she has become and how much better she feels. I look forward to her calls every day and she is always on my mind. 

I was wondering if the people in this subreddit had any ideas for a gift that would be good for someone that had just completed rehab. She still has three weeks left or so.  I recently got a Fitbit and I love it and she has expressed a desire to exercise more so I was thinking she could get one and we could use them together so she would continue the new trend she developed in rehab. 

Do any of you have something that would have been helpful to you after you finished rehab? Or just anything in general.

"Isolating myself and breaking down all the time. Advice? First time poster here. I've been diagnosed with complex PTSD. Being abused from age 5-19 from my step dad really did a number. I won't get into the details of it but it was really really severe. It didn't just affect me though. My twin sister and I were subjected to it after my mom married the guy and then they had 4 more kids. I ended up turning him in when I turned 19. It was everything from emotional and physiological to physical and sexual abuse basically every other day for 14 yaers. 

Some of you might be asking why I didn't turn him in earlier. For one, he was a cop. Life long career cop that told me that he would find out if I tried to tell anyone before I could get help. Second he threatened to kill me and all of my siblings if he even caught an inkling of me trying to reach out for help. Even told me how he would do it. 

Anyways... 

Lately I've decided to quit using nicotine and I feel like my brain is literally breaking and falling apart.

"Concerned about my 18y/o brother My brother was diagnosed with asperges and autism at around 2/3 years old. He's grown out of as well as developed a lot of different traits as he's grown up.

Now he's 18, he's finished college and has no idea what he wants to do with his life. Initially he really wanted to (and still does) want to join the vetenery core in the Army. So he applied to join the resevers and was immediately rejected because he has diagnosed autism...

I'm really worried that he's getting into a spiral and I'm not sure how to help him. He's very open with me and we're super close but I'm scared he's getting increasingly down. He's becoming more high functioning and I'm not sure if this is just a new trait or if it's been triggered by depression?

I hope this all makes sense, I just want to make him feel okay and check he's doing fine.

He doesn't go out and doesn't really have any friends - he's always been like this and it doesn't affect him, but I think it's starting to get to him the older he's getting. I don't want him to feel like he has no purpose.

Wanted to ask out to reddit and see if anyone has any ideas as to how I could help him get out, to see if I can get him to speak to me. I'm not autistic but I have been depressed, I'm not sure if his autism would make his depression any different?

"Keep Hope Alive Friends I've been meaning to make a post like this for a while now. The fist of it is that my life is going super great now. 

I was going to therapy for about a year before my diagnosis, and as things were coming to a head for my symptoms we finally realized what's was happening. My appointment with a psychiatrist wasnt for a couple of months so we did everything we could for a couple of weeks to get me on medication as my symptoms grew worse and worse. I honestly didnt think anything was wrong really, things weren't that unusual to me. Looking back o can definitely say I needed help and I'm glad I got it. 

So I started medication, 5mg of Zyprexa which quickly became 20mg. Academia had been really important to me over the past few years. I graduated high school when I was 15 and immediately started taking college level math courses, I wanted to be a math researcher. I was 18 and a semester away from getting my AA when I was diagnosed. I thought I could keep going as normal but I dropped all but one of my classes the following semester and ended up essentially taking a break from school for about a year. 

I thought my life was over. It took me a while to tell my girlfriend and she was very supportive when I did, but I always worried about getting too symptomatic around her and how that would affect our relationship. The meds I was on basically destroyed me. I gained 60lbs in just a couple of months and was sleeping 16-18 hours a day. Essentially spending no time with anyone and just going on my computer. I remember thinking, though I'm not religious, that this is what gods plan for me was. That I was struck down and wasnt going to be able to live the life of academia I had always strived for, that my girlfriend would leave me and I'd continue on this path of despair.

Well that's not the case today. It's been a year and a half since my diagnosis, I'll be turning 20 in may. I'm on much better medications. I'm actually engaged to my girlfriend, I guess fiance now. I'm back in school at the top of my class in a Mathematical Proofs class. I actually just got a 100 on my last exam. 

What I'm trying to say here is that schizophrenia is a sole crushing disease, that we all here live with every day of our lives. Its difficult to parse what's real and what we can trust and that's makes it difficult to hope for a better future for ourselves. I was there, I'm still kind of there but I want to say that that is not the only option for us. We are human, and capable and strong individuals, and if you can find even a glimpse within yourself of hope keep that spirit alive.

"I am so tired of tiptoeing around land mines in my life (PHYSICAL ASSAULT TW) BACKGROUND: my PTSD is centered on a a series of physical assaults I suffered through during my teenage developmental years (about a decade ago). They involved beatings and my face being forced into water for periods of time. I have times where my coping is strong, but I’ve had a lot of life stress recently that has brought more frequent nightmares and stressors. 

A coworker asked me if I would be willing to be a sparing partner. I have a martial arts black belt, but haven’t practiced in years. He hadn’t either, and wanted someone in a similar boat to work through his muscle memory. 

I wish I didn’t have to avoid truly telling him why I can’t. I wish I didn’t have to try and decide whether or not friendly sparing would trigger an episode. It’s like a bomb constantly waiting for the right button to be pushed; waiting for fingers to curl in just the right way, or a playful shove to have just the right amount of pressure. 

I wish I didn’t have to pull the barber aside to tell them they can’t put the hot towel over my face, I wish my knuckles weren’t white while they wash my hair. That I was able to let shower water run over my face, or let people touch me when I’m in a swimming pool. 

I want to not flinch when a hand moves too quickly. I want to not shy away from physical affection and intimacy. I want to truly feel safe and carefree in water.

In so many ways, I feel I’ve grown from the broken child I was when it all happened. But in weeks like these, years after my trauma, I feel so helpless again to the hold it has on me. I’m so worried that I’ll never be given release from the torture.

I travel for months at a time for work and am only ever ""home"" for a few weeks to months out of the year (only once a year).  I started going to my psychiatrist because i was tired of dealing with a myriad of unmedicated mental health issues. I told her flat out that I was there to figure out a medication combination that would help me get my head right. She said that she could work with my lifestyle and do Skype appointments. She told me right away that she wanted to try putting me on the antidepressants first to see if that would help alleviate some of the ADHD symptoms, so we tried it. Months later now, my doc has told me multiple times that she isn't able to prescribe me anything for my ADHD regardless of my symptoms because prescribing Vyvanse (or Adderall or anything else) gets too complicated out of state. 
She said just try yoga and meditation. Fine. But am I really not allowed to have this prescription just because I travel too much? Am I missing some other option here? 
I'm also a little worried that she thinks I'm just in it for the drugs, although I've tried to be clear that I only want the medications to have a healthier functioning brain. ",adhd,adhd

"Schizophrenia Help Background: I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia by my psychiatrist at the age of 13 and OCD at the age 10, I am currently 14 years old. But I recall having delusions and OCD symptoms before that.

This is my attempt to try to help those with this specific problem I'm about to address.

Problem: I always think, commenting on what I'm doing recalling past even when I'm dping something. Songs playing in my head constantly, talking in my mind so much that my physical body moves automatically, foget everything, can't understand conversations, feel disconnected with physical things. 

What I did/am doing: I'm taking antipsychotics and antidepressants as instructed by my psychiatrist and am going to a therapist. The therapy sessions helped me alot and I've taken notes and summarized what I've experienced

Probable Solution:
• To stop general abnormal thinking:
change focus on sensations and
focus there, dont stop thinking by
controlling your mind or by telling 
your mind to stop. Just switch 
focus to physical sensations
• For example:
1. Feel your body, shirt and what you're looking at, ambient sounds, games and such.
• For the procedure:
1. If you dont know, hold something rub it on your skin and focus the sensation there and thats the general feeling of changing sensations
• Important Notes: 
Don't enhance attention, it feels like tightening head Even if it's weak there is still the sensation and it will grow stronger once fed.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"Missing my maladaptive daydreaming I’ve been diagnosed ASD since I was 15 (21 now) I used to struggle severely with anxiety growing up however since my diagnosis and getting a better understanding of how my brain works and what triggers me, my anxiety is very much under control, which I am extremely grateful and lucky for as I know this is not the case for most people.

However during the time my anxiety was at its worst (most of my childhood) I had extremely vivid daydreams. The typical MD where you have your own world, characters, relationships etc. And to be honest I loved them, I would always try to trigger them whenever I could (I understand this is a symptom of MD).

Since I’ve gained more control over my anxiety I have lost the ability to MD but I really miss it. To this day I try to make up new scenarios and characters but nothing sticks anymore.

I assume that for most people who have experienced MD, getting rid of it is the ideal situation but it makes me feel so sad now that I can’t have them anymore. I feel that my MD made me more in touch with my emotions and that losing MD I’ve lost touch with myself.

"Are fast metabolisms real? I’m aware that my ED can make me irrational regarding these things so I’m looking for an outside perspective if any of you are knowledgeable about this. It’s my belief that (non disordered) naturally skinny people do not think about food often, often forget to eat, and do not realize how many calories they are actually eating. 

Outside of this sub, these thin people will often defend themselves by saying that no matter how much they eat, they cannot gain. I see these discussions a lot in a reality show sub I frequent. When a contestant is very thin or shows signs of disordered eating, people will comment their concern or disdain. There are generally several people that defend them by saying they have been skinny all their life, have been ridiculed for it, but still can’t gain weight. Personally I agree that the person in question shouldn’t be judged or put down (this sub is REALLY bad about it for certain women in particular), but I also think there’s a good chance they do have an ED. 

Honestly, my first instinct is that they either are lying or simply don’t think about food and therefore don’t eat as much as they should. But I also can’t trust myself do my ED. 

So are “fast metabolisms” real? Could a woman A eat 2200 calories everyday and weigh 110 pounds, while woman B eats the same amount and weighs 130? Assuming they have the same activity level

"What Exact Condition Do I Have? I've never been diagnosed (because I've never gone for a diagnosis) but I've always known that there was something off about me. 

Here are my traits:

1) I've always been naturally introverted (but I've still enjoyed social interactions)

2) I feel overwhelmed easily (in social situations too) and I suffer from OCD and anxiety.

3) I can't instinctively and easily communicate with people. It doesn't come naturally. 

I can't even talk to my own dog like the way everybody talks to their dog. Most people interact with their dog and naturally say stuff like '' Oh who's a good boy? You are! Yes you are! '', but when I talk to my dog I only say his name. That's it. I just keep repeating his name and pet him.....I don't say anything else. It's like I have a block inside me. And this is weird because there's no social anxiety when interacting with a dog, so I don't know why this block is there.

4) In group situations, most people ignore me and get annoyed by me. It feels like I'm in my own world and everybody else is in another world. 

I once watched a recording of myself in a group situation. I could tell from the recording that my behavior was just..... off. I kept repeating stuff to some of my friends, and even after they expressed disinterest at my idea, I just kept repeating it again and again like a mad man. I ignored all social cues....wasn't listening to anyone else. I was in my own weird world. Just repeating stuff again and again. Talking incessantly even though people told me to stop talking.

I’m not sure where to start but I will just wing it.  I (f/30) had a nightmare a couple weeks ago regarding to something that had happened a couple years ago, I’m going to spare y’all with details.  I told my boyfriend (m/25) next morning about my nightmare, he said it seems like I’m experiencing PTSD.  So I called my dr, set up an appointment and met up with my dr the following week.  She confirms I have PTSD, prescribed me to Prazosin for night terrors.  I’m going to see therapist for PTSD in a couple weeks.  Have anyone tried this medicine and how do you cope PTSD? And most importantly, how do my boyfriend help/what can he do?  I think he feels helpless because I do not like to talk about my traumatic experiences and I feel like it might put a strain on our relationship or I might be overthinking.  I do love him deeply although I don’t show it enough, I don’t want to lose him.  He tries to support me, assures me I’m safe. Mind you, I live in protected building with security key to enter into building with front/back door cameras.  I’m kind of in denial, I’m not sure how to process this..5 days later I’m still digesting with the new diagnosis of PTSD.  I already have anxiety and was diagnosed it earlier this year.  I’m on Buspar for anxiety, it’s been helpful.  I hope I’m doing the first post right lol

"I went home yesterday I work as a chef in a kitchen. The last 1.5 week I'm  running the whole kitchen, together with another chef, as our colleague quit while we were already understaffed and our boss can't find anyone else. We work 6 days a week, 10 hours a day. The need for alcohol is seriously strong. I'm tired when I wake up, and when I'm done at night, the only thing I can think of to relax a bit is alcohol. I mean, this was the case already when I worked 4 days, but whatever.
Usually when I start drinking, there is no stop. I want to go places to drink more, even on my own.  It's fucking sad. When I was a student it was all fine, but now it's more and more obvious to me that I have a problem. It's why I subscribed.
Acknowledging the problem is a start, right?

Yesterday I drank 3 beers after work, but instead of going places to drink more, I forced myself to go home. I'm glad I did. I would not have enjoyed myself, just drinking and smoking at a bar on my own. I would have lost money. I would have had 5 hours of sleep or less, and a hangover. So I'm glad. It's a start.

When I read about 11 it stopped and then last year during my exams the yelling woman who i can’t understand started yelling at me again I find it scary and unbearable.

"Escaping the grips of denial I posted this in stop drinking but I'd like to get as many opinions as possible.

I'm in my early 30's and have had a relationship with alcohol since I was about 19. I never thought I had a problem with alcohol even when it should've been abundantly clear that alcohol was ruining my life. It was really only until about a week ago after a relationship fell apart that the reality of my alcohol abuse became apparent. This didn't become clear immediately after everything fell apart. I still held the belief that she was the issue that things didn't work out. I wasn't perfect but this wasn't my fault.

It was only about 2 weeks after when one night I was researching alcohol and relationship issues that I stumbled down the rabbit hole reading everything I could about alcoholism. The signs. The behavior patterns. At first I felt personally attacked. My mind still not wanting to accept that I had a problem. It was uncomfortable to read all of these things that were basically spot on as far as my lifestyle and behavior. But I kept reading. I read first hand accounts of wives/girlfriends/husbands  living with an alcoholic. I read for hours. Eventually a switch went off in my head. I don't know but I swear to God I physically felt something go off in my brain. Maybe my ego crumbling to the ground? It felt very strange. At first uncomfortable as hell but that was followed with a sense of enlightenment? Releif? Acceptance? I can't really explain it. Have you seen the matrix? It felt like I was fucking, Neo and I just took the red pill. I was able to see reality for the first time and denial was the matrix.  For the first time I was able to admit that I have a very very real problem with alcohol abuse. 

Then I started to reflect on my behaviors in the past and everything made complete sense. It wasn't like I was  using alcoholism as a scapegoat. Like a get out of jail free card to absolve me of all my shitty actions/words I said. I just can't believe that I was stuck in some fantasy world even when the same behaviors, issues, consequences kept repeating in very predictable pattern. It just blows my mind that I was so blind to everything. It made me feel incredibly ignorant and very... well dumb. My denial was so strong I rationalized my drinking and blamed issues on everything but alcohol. I'm 30...I have learned about alcoholism, I've even been to AA meetings with my half sister when I was like 15 for her issues. But still denial blinded me. I know Im very early into sobriety but that realization made me sick to my stomach and made me see clear as day that I cannot ever moderate or have any kind of relationship with alcohol ever again. At this point in time I have 0 desire to drink. I just hope this feeling of self discovery stays with me for life. 

Has anyone had similar experiences? Is this common or was my case of denial unique? Denial actually scares the shit out of me to some extent. Will I one day rationalize my way right back into it?

"Help with 4 year old Autistic Son Hello Everyone!

My son is 4 and is pretty high functioning.  He goes to school 830-12, four days a week with an aide and has afternoon services at home those four days from 1-3.  He absolutely LOVES ""big boy school"" but this past two or three weeks it seems like he has been regressing.  He was playing indoor soccer and his shoe fell off during the game, it stressed him out so much that he hasn't stepped foot on the field or practice since.  He gets very anxious so we try not to push him on it too bad.  He also had his Xmas show for PreSchool and was very nervous but he did great.  Well ever since then he has been having accidents even though he has been potty trained for over a year.  Also he has been stemming really bad.  Before he had a few he would do when he was nervous but now he is looking out of the corners of his eyes, not making eye contact, spinning in circles, and spacing out a lot.  He also has become very emotional and starts crying if things do not go his way or we do new things.  Is it possible he is burnt out?  I'm not sure what the right thing to do is because I always hear advice of not keeping your Autistic kids secluded at home and doing lots of activities so they become more comfortable.  I feel like he has gone through the emotional stages every six months or so where he will be very latched on to us for a week or two and then it will fade.

"How to live like it won’t happen again, even though it might? (TW: health/abuse) So I’m suffering from what I believe is PTSD after my first serious illness. I developed post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome right after graduating college. Long story short, three months ago I got back to functional using an unconventional method, and got a really good internship in my chosen field. But since then I’ve been drowning in fear and anxiety about relapse constantly, specifically worrying that A) My chosen recovery method was a placebo and the returns from it will diminish any day now, or B) My anxiety over relapse will make it so I don’t perform my recovery “duties” well enough, and it’ll be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not only does my constant anxiety create triggering physical symptoms like fatigue and dizziness, but it leads me to do things that cause more symptoms, like “scanning” my body for sensations and not participating in my hobbies/seeing my friends for fear of becoming drained and having to stop my internship. I’ve dealt with post traumatic stress before, after an abusive relationship, and I’ve been trying to gain confidence by reminding myself that I thought I would be affected by it forever, but wasn’t. But this is different from a breakup obviously, because you don’t always get to choose to “leave” an illness, and you often don’t have power over whether or not it comes back. Reading CFS support forums doesn’t help, because the general consensus there is that psychotherapeutic means of recovery (like what got me back to functioning quite rapidly) are total bullshit. So I stay away from those forums at all costs, afraid that it’s too late and I’ve already shattered the “illusion” that my condition has improved by reading them in the first place. So I carry on like this, afraid of my
body for how it might betray me, and afraid of my mind for how anxiety might affect my body.

TL;DR What I’m getting at is, I know that I’ll never know if a relapse will occur, and so my best bet is to live like it won’t (with the exception of taking care of myself). Does anyone have any tips about how to cope with post traumatic stress in cases where you can’t logically reassure yourself that the traumatic event (illness) won’t happen again? Thanks",ptsd,ptsd

"My First Weekend I decided not to drink any alcohol this weekend. I have been drinking pretty much every wknd for about 5 years. I never drank to get drunk. Anywhere between 3-4 glasses of wine 2 to 3 nights a week. So I have never been a heavy drinker or an every day drinker. 

In the last year, I had started not liking many things. That first sip of wine not hitting my stomach right. Nothing intense. Just that yucky feeling when it first hits. But I powered thru and after that initial yuck, I was fine. I had always woken up a few times during the night every night that I consumed wine. Alcohol puts me to sleep fast but interrupts my sleep about 4 hours later. Dry mouth. That yucky sort of burning feeling in my stomach. Still a little buzzed and when coupled with waking up from sleep, it's not a good feeling. The run down tiredness feeling the next day. Sometimes headaches. I have finally reached the point of being very tired of alcohol. I made a choice to actively start listening to what my body is telling me about alcohol while I was consuming it. It really makes you realize that our bodies really do see alcohol as poison. It can be subtle, but it is there. 

So, today when I woke up, after getting a full night of uniterputed sleep, it feels wonderful. I didn't drink last night. I always drank on Thursday nights after work.  (I have off on Fridays and Saturdays. ) Absolutely no plans on drinking tonight. I feel so good about this decision. My day is much brighter. I have not made a decision yet if I am quitting for good or just keep it to a once a month event. I have never considered myself an alcoholic per say. I feel like it's just a bad habit that I got myself into. I never really drank until I was 46 yrs old (Am 53 now). I was in a bad relationship with an alcoholic 4 yrs ago and that's how I got started into drinking more frequently. I kept it up after that relationship, not really thinking about it. 

So, I made the decision to actively listen to my body. It tells us things. Good luck to all of you on your own journey thru this.",alcoholism,alcoholism
"Where do you start? Im writing this after talking to my SO about lurking in this sub and r/stopdrinking.
Every day i wake up and say "" i dont need to drink tonight."" But by the time my day is done, i have my pint and my six pack ready to take me as far as i need. Usually i only drink 3 beers and half the pint before im okay enough to go to bed. I work a stressful construction job with not so long hours, but customers who expect a nit picky level of execution with salesmen who don't give a fuck. I justify me spending 15 dollars a day to keep me going. Every damn day i add up how much im spending, how it affects my daughter and my fiance and the one on the way, but i just cant get myself to really kick the habit. I know its killing me. I know i need to change. Everything i read from here says find sober activities, but everything i do after work seems to go better with a beer and a few shots. Even shit that shouldn't, like woodworking or anything with power tools. Idk how i havent cut off a finger honestly lol. Ive been at worse levels of consumption for about 5 years, would kill half a fifth and a six pack of 8 percent beer and would have to eat food to not throw up, sometimes even get in the shower and alternate between conpletely cold water and scolding hot water to shake off the spins or nausea. 
I talked with her tonight about my issues and that i know i need to change, but i guess im looking to all of you for support. Even though, cowardly, im writing this while im drunk enough to go to bed. I dont want to wake up tomorrow and tell myself that i dont need to drink, and end up doing the same old shit.

"I think I've got it all together!? I'm drunk now. I usually am. I drink 10 or so a day.  I have a good job, kids, a wife, and I seem to excel in every category of my life. I struggle financially but all the bills are paid and theres lots of food in the fridge and cupboard.

I've racked up a fair amount of credit card debt paying for things after I pay for alcohol with my real money.

My kids have never known me sober. My wife is equally as drunk as me. 

My wife and I fight sometimes after the kids are in bed. I forget why for a couple days until I remember. Then it's usually her fault. (Not being cocky there. She always admits guilt)

I truly believe we are drunk undetected aside from the apparent multiple cases of liquor I bring home that the neighbours see me carry in every day.

I dont give a fuck about what people think. I only worry about my kids.

I'm as drunk as I usually get. And I cant remember what point I was trying to get across but it's pretty clear that I'm worried about my kids.

"The Spectrum is not a linear scale from ""a little autistic"" to ""very autistic"" I've read several things lately which make me want to post this reminder:

The word ""spectrum"" in Autism Spectrum Disorder confuses a lot of  people, leaving them with the understandable (but mistaken) impression that the spectrum is a linear scale from ""a little autistic"" on the far left to ""very autistic"" on the far right.

This is not an accurate useful way to understand the idea of the Autism spectrum.

The link below offers a much better way of understanding what  ""spectrum"" means, in a quick, visual, and easy-to-digest manner and I recommend it often.

"Diagnosed with depression. Should I get a second opinion? I’m 30 year old female and just went for a psychiatric evaluation for the first time. I was seen by a nurse instead of a doctor, because the next appointment available with a doctor was at the end of March.  I didn’t want to wait, so I agreed to see the nurse. 

Anyway, I told her some things about my situation, and I feel like early on she made up her mind that I had mild depression. She recommended I go to therapy and I could try Wellbutrin, an antidepressant. I told her I didn’t feel like I was depressed, and left. I didn’t mention anything about anxiety, ADHD, depression or any thing prior to the appointment, because I wanted an unbiased opinion. Did I screw up? 

My work and relationships are suffering. I hate my job. I cant stand being at my desk for more than few hours at a time. I end up getting in the office late, going to the gym for 1-2 hours, and leaving early. I can get fired for it, but my supervisor hasn’t said anything about it. I still get all my work done. My desk is also right next to a printer and a door. Every time someone walks in/out it drives me insane. I think the work itself is boring and mind numbing. I finish it fairly quick. I’ve been day trading the stock market while at work. Overall I feel like I’m wasting my life away, not really making an impact. I feel like it’s killing me slowly. 

I have a lot of hobbies that I rarely touch anymore. I own firearms, a motorcycle and race/track car. I have a lot of ideas about new hobbies, starting a new business, or getting a new degree.  

I constantly fantasize about moving to a different state and start a new job/life.  I only feel alive and calm when I’m working out or hiking.

I have difficulty managing relationships.
I am kind of dating two guys right now. I don’t really see myself with either.

When people will ask me to hang out, and I’ll tell them I have important stuff to do at home. I end up watching TV, playing with my dog or phone, and moving things around the house. 

I am exhausted. Should I get a second opinion?

"My experience going to the doctor I have no one else to share this with, so I'm just writing it here. I recently went to the GP for a checkup after more than a year of severe bulimia. Fortunately my bloodwork looked fine, my potassium was at 3.6 so fine atm (reference range is 3.5-5.0) and he listened to my heart and lungs too. 

However I'm not sure how to feel about it. I have mixed feelings. I asked him if there's medication, and he said there's no such thing despite me reading that Fluoextine is often prescribed for bulimia. I've heard it help many. He still urged me to go to an eating disorder clinic, but I don't know if I'm ready for recovery yet which I shared with him. 

It's made me feel kinda crappy going there, because he asked me how I'm going to be able to handle my studies and that I should go and get some help before the semester starts. I don't even know.. I'm so mentally and physically exhausted and the therapist I talked to said it can be hard work and involve a lot of homework..

I don't know what the point of all this is, I'm just really ambivalent about things. I know that I can't keep this up, throwing up every day. This is like a shitty addiction that's ruining my life. I'm worried that he's right and that there's no point in me trying to finish my studies, because I'll fail anyway. Even if I do get therapy, isn't it gonna take a long time to break these habits?

"Getting a diagnosis as an adult? Hi everyone, 

For some background, I am a 22 year old female who has struggled with anxiety and OCD my whole life. I was recently officially diagnosed with severe OCD which has given me a lot of relief, but has not given me all of the answers I was looking for. I saw an AskReddit that was talking about autism in females and a lot of what the girls in the post were saying sounded a lot like me. I recently read this article (https://the-art-of-autism.com/females-and-aspergers-a-checklist/) and feel like everything is spot on. Even the physical symptoms such as pacing, closed fists and sensitivity to sounds and lights. I have always been super sensitive to sound, sometimes to the point of tears. Even my family members have always “joked” to me saying “your so autistic” (offensive, I know, just trying to explain that others have noticed my sensitivity to light and sound). 

I thought being diagnosed with OCD was the answer I was looking for as to why I never fit in, why I was always bullied but I’m now starting to think it sounds more like what was discussed in that article.

My question is, have any females in this forum been diagnosed as adults? I feel like all of the symptoms of autism I had very strongly as a kid/teen, but now I have kind of taught myself how to “act normal”. Would this make it impossible for me to get a clear diagnosis?

I wasted all those years, still being miserable. I finally fired him and tapered off all my meds. I felt free, like I broke up with a controlling boyfriend. I knew I needed to work on the core of why I'm so miserable (lots of trauma) so I scheduled an appointment with a well regarded trauma therapist. 

She spent the whole appointment covering herself. She said I was ""passively suicidal"" (I said I have no intention of hurting myself again but see no meaning in life). She said I needed to be ""stabilized."" She sort of threatened she might need to commit me (which was a very traumatic experience for me). And said she'd need to discuss my history with my old Psychiatrist and she probably wouldn't be able to work with me unless I was at least on anti-depressants again.

I felt kind of defeated in a way by the label “PTSD”. I’m just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience.",ptsd,ptsd
people around me are trying to control me for the first time in months i stepped on a scale (regret it so badly lol) and jus found out i weighed 99 pounds (45 kg) and today i hopped on again and i gained 1 pound and so ofc it made me insecure and sad and now i can't stop thinking about it. i'm really bloated and my stomach looks bigger than usual because of this bloat. my mom found out (who is the reason why i've been obsessed with my weight btw) told me to not go lower and i need to be at least 110 pounds (50 kg) and it's triggering me and i jus feel like actual shit because of it. sorry for venting :/,EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"Unsure what to do for my 3yo, preprimary this year or keep him out for EIBI next year? So age wise my 3yo will be 4 this fall and can start pre-primary. My neighbour has a boy a year older than mine also on the spectrum who barely said a word last year and talks SO much now after pre primary.      

And if people could not give me hate over this part, we are on the waitlist for EIBI. Early Intensive Behaviour Intervention. From research it's not the same as ABA but similar ideas, entirely play based?   I'd love to hear experiences from people who have been through EIBI or parents who's kids have but no one locally has responded to my questions.       
The thing is if I want him in EIBI it wont be til NEXT year - *probably* we cant know our place on the waitlist but ""he won't get missed"". 2020. And if he goes into preprimary this year then primary next year he will be removed from waitlist once hes in Primary.     

So my options are:    
 -Put him in preprimary hope it helps him more than EIBI would then go to primary the next year.      
-Put him in preprimary then keep him out the next year for EIBI, do EIBI at home/pay for daycare
-Keep him out of preprimary til next year and then put him in and he does preprimary and EIBI at the same time/they do a lot of it at preprimary/daycare.     


My head hurts thinking about this. I think hed REALLY enjoy preprimary. But what if I put him in preprimary and it doesnt help and he needs EIBI next year? What if I keep him out and put him in EIBI just to not like how they do things?           
I'm hella indecisive and have bad anxiety especially when it comes to the kids. His Early Intervention worker, who he loooves, thinks EIBI will benefit him, but I guess she would 🤷‍♀️ I really just dont know and want to do what's best for him",autism,autism

"Help with getting up in the mornings/getting out of the house in general. I'm 18 years old with autism and aspergers, and my whole life I've had difficulties with getting out of bed early in the morning to go to school/college etc. 

When I was younger, I'd throw full tantrums to the point where my mother would have to physically drag me out of bed. There'd rarely be a day where I wouldn't have a meltdown first thing in the morning. As soon as my mother came into my room to wake me up, I'd start crying immediately. 

As I got older, it wasn't as 'dramatic', but I still suffer with it. No matter what I'm supposed to be getting up for, I dread it the night before. Nowadays, the tantrums have turned into just general miserableness. 

In the past few months, I've had absolutely nothing to be getting up early in the morning for. Until this morning.

I had to get up for a small interview. It wasn't something that I was particularly dreading, I wasn't afraid of this interview at all. But as soon as I woke up early today and realized that I had to get out of the house, the feeling hit me again.

I felt absolutely awful. I was quivering, angry and depressed. Everything that everyone did was irritating. And not in the typical 'early-morning grumpy person' type of way. I just wanted to shout, scream and lock myself in my room.

"Suspended from my job, pending termination. I'm blaming my ADHD. TL;DR: I was suspended from my job last week because I came in late too many times and spent too much time on the Internet. Might be facing termination, but I haven't had any negative performance conversations with my manager before this one.

Last March, I started what I thought would be a long career with a large Fortune 500 company I've admired for years.  I have a bachelor's degree from a top-25 university, and work in middle management in what you could say is a ""niche"" industry. I got a huge pay raise when I switched companies - currently I make high 5-figures per year and support a stay-at-home wife, a 3-year-old son and another baby on the way in July.  Now I'm freaking out because I've been suspended for performance (with pay, fortunately). I know my ADHD is probably the root cause of my performance issues, so I'm asking for your experience and advice on how best to deal with this situation.

One week ago today, my boss called me into his office and started asking questions about my attendance and my Internet usage on the job.  My industry runs a 24-hour operation, so my schedule has generally been 3 days of first shift per week (4:30 AM start) and 2 days of second shift (12 noon start).  My boss asked me when I usually report to work on the first shift, and I told him truthfully, that I don't remember specific days but I usually show up between 4:30 and 5:30 AM.  I'm salaried so I don't have to clock in or out, and things don't get busy at my workplace until after 6:00, so I didn't think reporting at exactly 4:30 was crucial. Plus, I stay well beyond 8 hours many days when on first shift--sometimes until 5 or 6 PM.  I have one colleague in the same position as me; I also told him when I first started the job last year, she kept roughly the same hours (scheduled for 4:30 but she usually came in closer to 5:30 since she stopped at Starbucks every morning, and Starbucks doesn't open until 5 AM).

Boss man then asked me to pull out my company laptop and show him my Internet history. He said ""there had been reports"" from someone that I was spending too much time in my office when I should have been walking the floor. I then told him for the first time that I have ADHD, and have difficulty concentrating on administrative tasks. I explained that when I'm doing something repetitive (i.e. punching in payroll) I get distracted easily and often flip between the task at hand and another browser window.  Usually the other browser window is a news site like NY Times or Wall Street Journal, stock trading web sites, or discussion boards related to the industry I work in. He tallied up my Internet usage for a few days and calculated that I was spending an average of 1 hour 15 minutes ""loafing"" every day when I only get one 30-minute lunch break. I told him that my brain sometimes feels like it's going a mile a minute and that the news sites help me get through the mundane admin tasks, but he didn't seem to buy that explanation.  

I think my manager's biggest concern was that he perceived I was being untruthful by not telling him I was coming in at 5:30 instead of 4:30. He doesn't report till 9:00 so had no idea I was coming in later until some anonymous employee I supervise told him. I told him I wasn't clear of his expectation and that if 4:30 means 4:30, that I'd begin coming in on time every day. I also said I'd start setting a blanket restriction on any Internet usage in the office, and limit any online time to my personal iPad in a designated break area away from my office to avoid the perception of loafing.  This wasn't a good enough answer, as he then called HR an hour later and told me I was suspended with pay, indefinitely.  He said ""I like you and I want to give you a chance, but if you just look at this behavior, it could be grounds for termination."" He had me write a statement (in which I did mention my ADHD) turn in my company computer, phone, and ID, and escorted me out of the building.

Since then, I've had radio silence from my direct manager and from HR. I can still read my company email on my personal phone, and my boss has been copying me in on some emails the last couple of days--that may be a good sign that I'll be allowed to return to work at some point. I have no idea what he's told my coworkers about my sudden absence from work.  One other factor that may work in my favor: My company has about 1000 other managers at the same level as me, spread at other locations around the country. HR has posted guidelines for coaching and discipline for employees at my level on our company Intranet, and there's generally supposed to be more formal perfomance conversations done before going straight to termination. I have only had one performance review, last fall when I had 6 months with the company, and it was 100% positive (the only suggestion my manager had for improvement was ""wear a tie more often."")

I have casually started looking for positions at other companies, but there's pretty much nowhere else to go in my niche industry aside from my current employer. The idea of starting from scratch in a different industry is daunting and I don't even know where to begin.

As for my ADHD history, I started on Adderall XR + standard Adderall in 2014, prescribed by my family physician. The meds helped with focus and concentration, but the biggest side effect was that they made me act like an arrogant jerk - almost like all the ability to empathize and feel feelings was sucked out of me. My wife encouraged me to go cold turkey, so I went unmedicated until this past January when I found a psychiatrist who prescribed me Vyvanse 20mg. The Vyvanse is working well so far. I get the focus and concentration boost without the ""jerk"" complex. I'm also being treated for sleep apnea with a dental device, which has been life-changing and has helped me sleep better for those early morning shifts.

I'm tempted to call my boss and ask where I stand in the suspension/possible termination process, but with this being such a serious offense I don't want to risk being too aggressive. On the one hand it's been nice to get an extra week of paid ""vacation,"" but it's not like I have been enjoying myself much with this hanging over my head.",adhd,adhd
"my dad reminds me of myself during the worst phase of my ed i developed my ed after leaving home so he's not aware i ever had a problem with food (i mean he did notice i lost a shit ton of weight but he never said anything, good or bad, about it). i live in a different country than he does so i don't see him often. he was over visiting this week and... my god. he's constantly justifying himself whenever he eats (like ""oh i walked a lot today so it's okay to be hungry""), gets really anxious if he sits down for more than half an hour, he's constantly looking at his fitbit. this morning he was boasting to me about skipping breakfast. if we're out for dinner and i don't want any dessert bc i'm genuinely not hungry he'll spiral into endless self justification/hatred for ever wanting one. sometimes he'll avoid eating with me for no valuable reason even though we only see each other a few days each semester.

thankfully i have a great support system and it wasn't enough to hinder my own recovery (which is... a work in progress). he's always kind of been like that and i can definitely trace back some of my ed rules to his own food rules. i might just be more aware of his weird food and exercise habits because i'm trying to fight them myself but i really feel like it's more intense than before. i'm just worried, really. and i care about him a lot but our relationship is kind of awkward and idk how to bring it up to him.

"Undiagnosed and looking for advice, what was your experience? As a quick preface, I have read the sub rules - I am not asking if I should be checked for ADHD for the possibility that I might have the condition. I am asking for any advice you guys might have on if it's worth it to go through the process for formal treatment if your life isn't completely ending because of your issues.

I don't want to self-diagnose here and assume that I have ADHD, though I know that I fit essentially all of the symptoms. I have been struggling with these issues since childhood, and had special accommodations in some of my classes, but my parents were always very vocal that they don't believe these conditions really exist in kids, and inattentiveness and hyperactivity are just how kids are, so I never saw a professional and I was never diagnosed. I struggled a lot through school, but I managed to graduate college with average grades (with a lot of low points along the way). Now that I'm working full-time at 24 years old, I don't know if I can afford to ignore the issues anymore. A failing semester was bad, but I always was able to make it up later - I can't risk failing at my job and getting fired. I don't want to fail at my responsibilities. But I feel like it's going to happen inevitably if I don't do something.

So here's where I'm hung up: I'm worried about what's going to happen if I start down that path. Expensive medical bills aside (my insurance doesn't cover any mental health services until I hit a $2,000 deductible), I don't know how it would affect my life if I were to be diagnosed. On one hand, the idea of speaking to a professional who can tell me for certain would really put me at ease, and if I do have ADHD, obviously treatment should make things better. But on the other hand, I don't know if I can close that door. If I'm diagnosed, I'll have a official, medically recognized mental illness - in my family, there is a strong stigma against that, and I don't know if they would accept me. I'll have to disclose the condition to my insurer, and in the future, new legislation could make me uninsurable if ADHD is seen as a pre-existing condition.

I'm looking for any advice you have - your stories, good or bad. I don't think my life is going to end if I don't seek help, and it's possible I'm wrong and my issues are something different, but I would like to know what I'm getting into before I decide to do anything that might change my life.",adhd,adhd

"Out-of-the-blue cravings It always shook me when I got a sudden and intense craving out of nowhere. Even though I was weeks and months away from my last drink they would still suddenly jump up without any apparent cause. After the initial period of constantly fighting off cravings my recovery slowly settled down to be less demanding on a day-to-day basis until suddenly, out of the blue, I would get hit by a huge craving. Just why these suddenly pop up is quite simple but takes a bit of explaining.

Cravings don't come randomly, they are triggered by a completely automatic process in our brain that we have no control over or knowledge of... but it is still there and is called the ""reward system"".

A circumstance in the past that has yielded alcohol is remembered in the reward system; we call this a trigger. When that circumstance is met again then the trigger fires and a craving is launched. We feel this as the sudden wanting or longing for a drink. When we drink in response to this craving then our brain gives us a reward (hence the name: the reward system). The reward is a sudden and large dose of dopamine released in our brain. This gives us an immediate feeling of well-being, ease, and comfort. Did you ever notice that on taking that first drink you felt an “aaaaahhhh!” wash through you? That wasn’t alcohol that did that, it was dopamine … it happened immediately didn’t it? before the alcohol could possibly have been ingested and carried through the blood to the brain.

The more often a trigger is successful is getting a result (i.e. when we drink in response to the craving) the more powerful it becomes, and it becomes more powerful in two ways. The next craving that this trigger will induce will be stronger, and the next dose of dopamine released if the trigger is successful will be bigger.

When we act on an existing trigger we make it more powerful, and when we drink in a new circumstance we create a new trigger. In this way we build up hundreds and hundreds of drinking triggers; people, places, things, sounds, smells, and emotions; things we have in the past had a drink in the presence of. Through repetition these triggers become very powerful and compelling indeed…. as you have no doubt become painfully aware.

Drinking triggers never go away… they are never forgotten. It is a feature of the brain that what has become known cannot become un-known. In this sense what’s said in some recovery circles is true, that once we are alcoholic we remain alcoholics for life. But we don’t have to resist huge cravings for the rest of our lives… that’s not how it works. We don’t get better at beating cravings, the cravings change.

We can’t ever remove a drinking trigger; once it is there it is remembered for life. But we can change how powerful it is. Just as a trigger gets more and more powerful when we drink in response to it, it gets less powerful if it is not successful. If we don’t drink when we get a craving then the trigger that initiated the craving becomes less powerful… and the craving next induced by that trigger becomes less powerful. This is incredible important to know in recovery.

EVERY TIME I DENY A CRAVING THEN THE INTENSITY OF THE NEXT CRAVING INITIATED BY THAT PARTICULAR TRIGGER IS DIMINISHED.

When we stop drinking then we suddenly face a continuous barrage of cravings. Virtually everything about our daily routine is a trigger, so initially it is impossible to know which trigger fires which craving. But as we repeatedly deny the cravings then they lose their intensity until eventually they fall to a level that we can step past them without too much difficulty.

Now, to the “out-of the blue” cravings.

At first I met all the common triggers that surrounded my daily routine, and I knocked the power out of them by denying them one by one and time after time… but I didn’t meet all my drinking triggers all the time; there were still some lurking in my reward system that were untouched and had their full strength. These are often triggers left behind when our circumstances changed; a different location, partner, job, routine… or simply a particular circumstance we don’t meet very often, like a hearing song or a person that we haven’t heard or met for a while. When I met one of these triggers it could still have its full force. It fired a craving of the intensity it did last time it was fired, even if that was years ago. The cravings could be huge at a time when most of my cravings had become small. They caught me completely unaware as I’d not experienced a big craving like this for a while and I wasn’t gee-ed up ready to fend it off.

The only defence against these is to know that they will happen from time to time. So I try to simply recognise them as they come, and tell my inner-self “I’ve beaten bigger than that… is that all you’ve got?” They pass quite quickly (as they come as a single, unaccompanied craving) and are quite unlikely to pop up again any time soon.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Please talk me down from a binge/ reassure me (on mobile, can't flair! But probably a rant)

Let me preface to say I'm primarily a binger, not a restricter.  I gained like 60lbs my junior semester, lost 20, and am struggling to maintain around 200lbs ever since (about a year). I think I have a pretty reasonable GW for my height, which is 140lbs at 5'8. 

That being said, I've been trying to recover from binging by fasting. Yeah, I know, but it actually does work for lessening food's emotional pull which is helpful for me AS A BINGER (I'm NOT encouraging anyone to use it if their ED is restrictive). 

For the past two and a half weeks, I've done 3   48 hour fasts and eat reasonably between them. It's the longest I've gone without overeating/ binging in...years. However, the scale hasn't moved.  I know I'm at a deficit, especially since I'm a pretty high BMI, but there's a voice that says ""if you're still eating, that's cals you're not burning. Your metabolism is fucked and you won't ever reach your GW""

I'm taking a break from fasting the past two days because I have a cold, and am trying to do this as healthily as possible, but I usually lose a lot quicker and it's discouraging me. I'm also PMSing, which I know has something to do with it (bloating, emotional, extra cravings). 

I'm just frustrated that I'm not seeing results and want to expedite the process until I can consistently see the scale go down. Once I see that, and can see a difference in my body composition (around 185, 15lbs from where I am) it's easier not to binge because I have proof that the effort is worth it. 

But right now, I'm sick and PMSing and bloated and feel like binging, or at least treating myself to more than TDEE. 

I just need some reassurance that if I don't binge, and keep eating (and fasting) sensibly, I'll get over this bump and will see progress soon. 

(Please don't try and talk me out of fasting, it's worked the best for me in the past and stops me from obsessing over food. I'm not doing long ones, and it ""resets"" my stomach so I'm not so sensitive to the feeling of hunger, which I fucked up by binging. )

"Autistic accountants: public vs industry Now that I realize, as an autistic student in my final year in accounting, that assurance (external audit as I often hear about) is a poor fit because of the social dimension, maybe tax would be a better fit, should I still wish to keep the public accounting option open. Ideally, if I went the public accounting route, I would rather not work for a Big 4, but that I feel others could thrive at, say, PwC if they wish to serve clients in a specific industry or set of related industries. 

However, for what I know, industry work could be quite different from public accounting work and maybe some areas of industry work could be better fits for an autistic accountant than even tax at a public accounting firm. Probably not internal audit, though. 

P.S. I know about EY and Deloitte's initiatives, and I feel that, currently, these initiatives seem more geared towards IT advisory. In all my communications with them on the topic, I also mentioned how the strengths they wished to leverage were transferrable to tax work, and, to a lesser extent, assurance.",autism,autism

"I’m a [27 M] high functioning schizophrenic that takes frequent trips to the “void” (hallucinatory mental breakdowns) Sorry if none of this makes sense, when I’m trapped in my head it helps me when I write down my thoughts. Thanks for your time. 

In the Void, I like to record my thoughts when I’m here. 
What am thinking about? I have no idea, too many voices are talking at once. 
I hear them. 
I've got a bunch of voices in my head, I hear all of them and we are communicating, but we're having trouble deciding who should take over the body.
To communicate.
Which voice/thought is the most relevant?
Some are suggestive, some argumentative, some downright wrong.
Some are evil but I shone a light on those guys last year, easier to find. 
Literally if they pop their head out of the dark again I almost immediately kill them. 
They’re like entities trying to communicate and control me.

The demons tell lies to my emotions to trick the mind and soul into doing evil.
The angels make me acknowledge my sins and face the reality of my emotions.
Or non-demons I guess. 
What do the bad things suggest?
Vengeance.
Hedonism.
Ideas that make sense. 
Ideas that are too easy.

The author has been just watching silently. 
He used to taunt me, idk why we haven't talked in a while... makes me uneasy. 
Maybe he's waiting for a moment of weakness.
Unlikely.
Oh shit, it's because he doesn’t exist anymore! 
I just realized my perception of life doesn't work with him, it's illogical for him to exist.
Wow that's a good feeling.
That feels really nice.

How did i make my alter stop?
My alter gained control by weaponizing my fear. 
I would retract into myself and he would go off on a violent rampage. 
That was ignorance forming fear, and that fear became hatred.
I put 2 and 2 together and realized ""if fear comes from ignorance, what happens if I eliminate my ignorance?"" 
So I jumped into the void and kept going deeper, flailing about in the chaos, coming up with questions to every answer but never gaining answers. Just more questions. The more I learned the more ignorant I got, the more afraid I became. So I decided to pick a direction and go with it. My logic was ""even if good exists just to be taken away from us, even if love serves the devil, even if this is hell, I've experienced beauty in my life"".  
This basically opened up a new line of thought, and I ended up using the logic ""if there's an opportunity for me to not suffer, I will fight to not suffer. Good exists, so I'll fight to not feel bad. If I am to be tortured for eternity, so be it. But right now, nothing is stopping me from escaping this nightmare"". 

The demons taunt me, I shrug. The crowd cackles at me from the 5th dimension, I take a bow. I'll always be afraid, but i won't let it control me anymore. It's either gonna take me all at once or none of me at all. 
It feels like a labyrinth, solving puzzles and opening doors are epiphanies of the mind, it forms a path that is your personal ideology. You can go deep into your psyche if you open the right doors. 

Andy disappeared when I stopped calling him ""Andy"". When I found the source that created him, I literally felt a light vaporize it.
I had to relive the past and come to terms with what happened to me. It took a long time. 
Came to terms with my own sins too, as unforgivable as they are. Switched from ""you're worse than scum and don't deserve to ever be happy"" to ""you are now obligated to make the world a better place, which means you need to be in a better place."" Can't kill myself, promised my cousin when I was 7. Andy thrived off my misery and self hatred. But I don't hate me anymore, I don't see myself as an individual. I just got my perception of life, that's all I really own, and it makes no sense to hate the only thing I got. 

This is Valhalla, we're in hell. Hell is paradise. We are all suffering, we are all ignorant and afraid. None of us are in complete control of who we are, but we can control how we perceive life. I genuinely feel relief from this, and the lack of demonic power over my actions has proven my point thus far. Andy can't exist, nor can the author. They kept coming back due to me saying ""but what if they did, what if they control me again, what if my confidence and will to live is shattered when everything turns out to be a lie?"". Now I say ""if so, then I'm fucked. But until then, they don't exist"".",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"I got a job after 4 years of unemployment. So a little background, I used to work as a counselor but then developed delusions that caused problems.  I was delusional without any break for 3 years in a row until I finally had the delusions stop.  I started looking for work a couple months after my delusions stopped.  I had some interviews along the way, but it seemed like I couldn't get anything.  Around the time I started looking for work, I started posting on this sub because it was only when the delusions lifted that I could admit my diagnosis was right and that I had been delusional that whole time.  I posted less and less, but back in October when I was looking for work my plan was to post a big ""Yay me"" type post when I finally got a job.

"Advice for a friend Hello, I have a friend who is going through psychosis. He hasn’t been officially diagnosed with schizophrenia because the doctor can’t confirm it since he continues to smoke weed and drink. We are all really worried about him. He was on medicine for a while and was doing good as far as I could tell. He had went over a year without weed when he was on his meds but has always drank. He had talked with his doctor about quitting the medicine and was going to wean off. I think (not sure) that he started to wean off but then just went cold turkey. It’s been a while and at first he was okay just a little overly excited when talking about stuff. Passionate I would say. But now he is having more problems. His parents say that he is afraid of being labeled as schizophrenic and everything that goes with it. His mom told him that he will still be him and labels aren’t who you are. There was a long talk about how he needs his meds and that we just want him to be happy. His parents are great and have even asked his closest friend (my bf) for help since thats who he talks to and who can understand him the best.

I hope you’re all doing okay. I am sorry for not being able to relate to you 100% because I myself do not suffer from the illness (as of now, at least) but my mom does. 

Her mom didn’t have schizophrenia, and she never knew her father. However, she had me when she was 16, and after that regularly engaged in dangerous activities, such as frequent LSD use, PCP use, Stim use, etc. She also did smoke weed extremely often, and studies now are showing that smoking weed chronically or at an early age can affect the onset of the disorder.

"1 week without a drink after almost 10 years of heavy drinking. So I just got out of the hospital from which I was committed. I did a week of detox and am  still suffering some withdrawal symptoms such as tremors and profuse sweating but I feel better than I have in years. I've tried several times over the years to do it myself but the withdrawals were just too overwhelming especially knowing the dangers. Up until last Saturday I was drinking a handle of whiskey a day. Waking up dry heaving, shaking uncontrollably until I had my morning whiskey. I was a very high functioning alcoholic as in holding the same job for the past 10 years without anyone knowing except close friends. I called my dying father drunk Sunday morning and he I promised I would get treatment but he convinced me to do it right then, so I did, and I'm ever so thankful I did. I'm also thankful to the nurses and staff at the hospital that made sure I was as comfortable as could be in that situation. I really couldn't have done it without them and I am forever greatful. If you feel like it's time to quit, don't  wait, do it now. It's not that simple for some, I understand but the longer you wait the less simple it will get. I feel very fortunate and would love all the support I can get in the days ahead as the struggle isn't over yet, but I'm optimistic.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Crippling fear of abandonment Hi guys! I’m 19 years old and was diagnosed with PTSD a year ago after a suicide attempt, my two traumatic experiences are my father and my first boyfriend. ANYWAY

I have actual friends and an actual loving boyfriend for the first time in my life but every so often I have a mental breakdown and am literally incapacitated by my crippling fear of abandonment. I was so convinced a few days ago that my boyfriend was going to leave me (there was literally no trigger to this, it just happened out of nowhere) that I ended up having a huge panic attack and sobbing and not being able to move or function for a couple days.

"Accepting the fact that I have a problem. Now what? Hi Everybody,   


First time posting here. I have started to accept that I have a drinking problem and I need to stop. I've been really struggling with finances and I realized that my drinking habit (going out, cocktails, craft beer, was literally taking almost half of my pay check). I tried to do a sober January and made it just 13 days, and fell right back into my old routine of drinking daily (usually at least three).   


I've noticed I'm much more motivated by booze than my friends. Can't go skiing with out Apres, can't go mountain biking with out beers in the parking lot. If we go out with friends, I need atleast three drinks, whether it is dinner or if it is to party. While it hasn't creeped into impacting my professional life. I can tell my relationship with Alcohol is trending in a negative direction. Right now, I'm struggling with my finances and when I check my bank account almost 50 percent of my pay check goes to booze/going out. I don't have money for paying off my credit card or starting a savings, but I do always have money to spend 50 dollars on fancy cocktails. I'm not keeping up my half of the home expenses and it's negatively impacting my relationship.   


I recently read this artcle about the famous Montreal restauranteur, David McMillan who owns Joe Beef and gave up drinking. It really resonated.  [https://www.bonappetit.com/story/david-mcmillan-sober](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/david-mcmillan-sober) Particularly his opening line: ""I was never falling-down drunk. I was never belligerent. I always got my work done. I was never unkempt. I was always clean, I was always shaved, I always performed at work. I was always kind and gracious in the dining room. But I lived in hell.""  


It made me realize that alcohol abuse comes in many forms, and that I definitely do not have a healthy relationship with it. So I am hear to say that I have a drinking problem and I want to stop, but am looking for guidance on how?   


One realization I have had is that much of my life is built around booze. My girlfriend and love to explore new restaurants and breweries, we have our favorite wine bar that we go to for date nights, our favorite pub that we go to for comfort food, drinking while we cook dinner at home is a common occurrence. When we travel to a new city, our favorite thing to do is explore the local joints, eating and drinking our way around the city. It's a big part of our relationship.   


Additionally much of my life outside of work involves drinking, even the mountain bike advocacy group I am a part of has a beer sponsor, our trail nights end in beers at the trail head, our meetings are held at the up stairs of a local bar. Drinking is just part of what we do.   


I'm looking for advice on ways to quit, specifically:   


1. For me I feel like the easiest solution would be to remove my self from situations that involve booze, until I am sober. But the reality is that I can't do it. It would remove me from my partner, remove me from my friends and remove me from organizations and social settings that are all positives in my life. 
2. Are there good online resources and community that I can use? Where can I start? I'm not really a person for support groups and have found online communities to be a huge help with other issues. 
3. What has worked for you? Specifically to get through that first 30 days?

"College, ADHD, and Adderal XR (RANT) This is gonna be a long post, as I sit in my college dorm bed at 2:43 am another sleepless night. Recently I have been feeling overwhelmingly depressed especially since this semester again so I apologize as I am gonna mainly rant about ADHD and Adderal XR, but may go off on a few tangents. Anyway the reason I am posting this is to provide my self a place to spew my feelings.

First I wanna provide some background on my life. I was diagnosed from a very young age since I can remember I was made aware I suffered from ADHD. I was prescribed Adderal Xr as an adolescent and continuity took it to this day, however I do still avoid taking it when school is not in session including weekends and holiday breaks. All my life I hated the way adderal made me feel I felt like a zombie a totally different person. Off the meds I am very extroverted, but on them I become a total introvert; I hate it. I realized however that not taking the medication wasn't an option, realizing it was mentally painful to sit in class for 7 hours a day. So I kept taking it. I contribute my academic success (which was not top of the class, but definitely above average in high school) to adderal. With this I became such a motivated learner I wanted so bad to be considered a very smart person but I lacked the worth ethic to really apply myself to become that. Anyway I am now in college and prior to entering I became very fond with computer science. So that is what I am majoring in. And now I am here a second semester freshman up at 2:54 am now with my mind constantly stressing about being a successful student. I also have a girlfriend who I really click with we have been dating for 2.5 years now and she goes to school 9 hours away from me this has really made me fall into a depression that only started taking shape this semester. She was always someone that I could be with in times of stress and she would calm me down and make me feel better and now that shes away its so much harder because I don't have that aid. I also am constantly stressed about my courses I am taking 16 credit hours this semster same as last, and I am in Calculus. Calc. is already freaking me out I feel like I am not smart enough ever for anything I have constantly been beating myself up never ignoring people when they tell me I am smart. I am still not sure why I do I guess because I compare myself to other students that are actually very academically smart. I I hate being at this college and I wanna leave, but I feel scared that my parents might get annoyed I wanna transfer to be closer to my girlfriend, they just don't get what she does for my mental health. I joined a fraternity last semester and I can't decide if I wanna drop it or not. I like some of the guys but about 90% of them are total douchebags or still seem to be stuck in highschool to were all they care about is there self image and ""banging chicks, drinking beer, and having fun"" The only reason I am considering staying is because I like to have fun every now and then, but feel this semseter and semesters to come I wont have the time as I will be invested in my school homework. Back to the topic of adderal I am sick of it I totally think it is worsening my anxiety, stress, and depression, I am sick of not ever being hungry and not being able to sleep I am at my breaking point with this medication, but I know especially in the college level I can't just not take it anymore, no matter how bad I want to. I just feel lost right now like I am the only one feeling this way about the drug, and honestly I just don't know what to do.

tl;dr: hate the way adderal medication has been making me feel like a introverted zombie and a lack luster appetite. Also been having really bad anxiety/ possible depression and believe the adderal might be to blame.",adhd,adhd
"My relationship keeps triggering me and I dont know what to do My boyfriend is a good bf. I just came from super shitty relationships. And now i dont know what to do with them. 

 My first boyfriend played so many mind games and raped me a lot. It was my first relationship and I felt really scared to leave or he'd kill himself. When i broke up with him he wrote an 11 page letter on how I should go to hell and that hes going to kill himself because of me. Then my next relationship was hard because i was really really in love and he was an abusive narcissistic person, i felt like that whole relationship was a lie. After that I was in a bunch of pointless shit. 

I struggled with sex addiction, borderline drug abuse at 19, losing jobs, etc... Now im diagnosed with bipolar too. 

Its been a fucking struggle. Some days i want to end it. 

Now im in therapy and I take meds. However, My relationship now triggers me so much. My bf is good to me, hes smart and creative. Hes very optimistic and funny. He treats me well and likes to spoil me. The catch? I can't even take half of it. I feel like its all a lie and I always think about leaving. That's not fair to him. I want him happy. And i do love him, but I just dont love myself in the slightest. I compare myself all the time to him and I think why cant i be better like him. Then i start hitting low lows. And it doesnt stop.

We broke up briefly and he'd message me everyday and i ended up getting back together and now i just feel sad again. I want to be happy for him and be a good partner, i just keep fucking comparing so much. He doesn't understand mental illness much nor really understand a lot of my struggles but hes still supportive regardless. I wish i was more normal, im so confused. 

What should I do? :-(

"How can I deal with this paranoia in a healthy way? (possible triggers: rape, stalking, break-ins) I have rape-related ptsd from a very abusive relationship when I was 15 years old. My rapist stalked me long after the trauma, showing up in the cities I lived in, stalking me online, etc. I'm 26 now, and it's been 5 years since he directly contacted me. As of a year ago, however, he was still stalking me online (his linkedin showed up in my and my significant others 'who has viewed your profile' feed a year ago, and we blocked him).

&amp;#x200B;

On and off, I have had issues with paranoia related to my trauma, but lately I've been getting more and more intense paranoid thoughts about something not directly related to my trauma. In particular, I've been waking up at night, convinced that someone has broken into my home. The house I rent has pretty much the easiest locks to break. Last night I was up for a significant portion of the night in my room, with a baseball bat in my hands. Even the faintest sound registered to me as two people speaking downstairs. Eventually, my significant other woke up and did a sweep of the house. Of course there was nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate being this way, and I want it to stop. My instinct tells me to put super heavy duty locks on everything, but A) it's a rented living space and B) that doesn't seem like a very mentally healthy coping mechanism. I don't understand why this is happening, and why it's getting worse.

"How do I learn to tolerate Autistic Adults? I am really sorry if I offend anyone. I genuinely want to be a better person &amp; what I’m about to say is kind of shitty. 

I am in a mental health program (it’s for all mental illnesses) I suffer from depression to make it simple. It’s like a facility where u can socialize with others, have fun, &amp; receive therapy. There’s video games, music recording, support groups, ect. 

All for mental health recovery. There’s quite a view autistic people there. At first I didn’t think anything of it, wasn’t annoyed or anything at all. I’ve never been annoyed by this until recently. 

I was playing a video game with a person who happened to be autistic. She’s really nice &amp; sweet &amp; friendly. But she gets overly excited when she sees me &amp; she also has the mind of a 15 year old. She’s like 23. (Not saying Autism gives you a 15 year old mind) 

Anyway, she kept pausing the video game mid game &amp; getting completely distracted. Like she didn’t realize that she was annoying me at all &amp; that made me more annoyed. I let her know, in a friendly way that she should stop pausing so often. 

But I was deeply annoyed &amp; kind of angry. 

There’s another guy who’s probly 19 or so. He wrote a song &amp; sang it to me, &amp; it was horrible. HORRIBLE. Of course, I did not express this to him. I just told him it was pretty good for a first song. And he still has no idea that it was utter garbage. 

He tagged along with me when I was doing some things that I usually do by myself. Like playing piano &amp; he didn’t realize that I was annoyed. Or that I didn’t want company. He interrupts so much in conversations &amp; can’t tell that he’s annoying the speaker. It’s so annoying. 

There’s like 3 other Autistic people. The other 3 also talk over &amp;. Interrupt people while they are talking very very often. I don’t know how to deal with this. I know they can’t help it &amp; they are literally just being themselves. But I can’t help being annoyed. And for some reason, most of them have taken a liking towards me &amp; like to be around me.

I sound like a jerk but they have no idea I feel so annoyed because I’m nice to everyone &amp; I don’t show it. I don’t want to make them feel uncomfortable or bad for just being themselves.

"The organization treating post-traumatic stress and complex grief of veterans and their widows Every hour an American veteran dies by suicide. Behind every one of them, a wife, girlfriend, partner and often young children are left trying to process the loss and their new future. Who cares for these survivors? How do we, as a country, honor them? Turns out until recently we weren’t. I'm a producer for Empowered Health, a podcast focused on navigating women's health, and in honor of Memorial Day, we just released an episode will that unpacks the parallel between those veterans who are traumatized by a comrade’s death abroad and the women who have a similar experience when they lose their loved ones at home.

After Kim Ruocco lost her husband, Marine Corps Maj. John Ruocco, she recognized first-hand the lacking of support for women in her position. Ruocco’s had a connection that was in the perfect position to help. Brigadier General Jack Hammond, the executive director of Homebase, a Boston-based organization in partnership with Mass General, that was successfully treating veterans with post-traumatic stress and complex grief. By June 2017, the Homebase team came up with an iteration of their program to be catered to military widows. In this episode, we hear from Ruocco, General Hammond, and Dr. Bonnie Ohye, director of the family initiative and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, and hear how this unique two-week intensive program has given these women permission to live their lives again. Thought this group may have an interest in listening to the episode:

"Hello from the world of OCD! How do you manage your schizophrenia? Hello all! I have OCD (along with depression and general anxiety), and have been successfully treated with therapy and medication. Like any other chronic illness, I'm not cured. However my condition is very much managed. Some of the basic elements that I've learned in therapy are acceptance of thoughts (such as intrusive thoughts -- which are central to OCD) and emotions that I cannot control. I am not super familiar with the terminology of schizophrenia, but I'm curious if you guys manage your condition in a similar fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, when you guys have delusions, do you use mindfulness? I.e having the delusion that people are outside your house waiting to kill you, but you choose to mindfuly accept that may or may not be true and go out groccery shopping anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Or another example may be you have a fear of clowns and that they will harm you. Would you be encouraged to look at images of clowns repeatidly, or go to a circus and accept the clown may try and chop your head off?

"Talking about my symptoms and trauma is harmful to others (suicide TW) This post discusses anger towards suicide and suicide being called selfish. Please don't read if that's upsetting to you.

&amp;#x200B;

when I was about 14-16 I used to use a site clled the comfort spot to vent out my anger over my friend's suicide attempt. it was like an anonymous chat room where you just post how you feel and people can reply if they have any comfort to offer. now, I was a *very* angry child over my friend's suicide attempt and I had to let it out. like, I was absolutely raging. Like, so angry I could barely leave the house, barely eat, barely cook, barely go to school: the anger I felt took over my entire life. I'd have flashbacks and triggers that would ruin my entire day.

looking back i'm pretty sure I had PTSD, although I've yet to be diagnosed, and my anger was a symptom of the rage that sometimes accompanies PTSD. I know that I used to thinnk suicide was selfish and that was mainly due to the betrayal I felt; I don't think suicide is selfish anymore (most of the time anyway) but at the time, 'selfish' was the word that felt right to me to use and that fully encapsulated my feelings. using any other word felt invalidating and wrong to my experience. 

whilst I knew some people didn't like hearing anger towards suicide and I was ok with that, it never occurred to me until just now that veting about my trauma on a comfort website that was probably filled with suicidal people could have really upset someone or even...tipped someone over the edge. i'm scared my anger could have itipped someone over the edge, even if I didn't want to hurt anyone and just needed to talk about how traumatized I was. im scared and I don't know what to do.

 i don't feel like i fit into PTSD communities because i don't want to upset anyone. im too scared to talk about my symptoms of rage and anger in case i offend someone and tip someone over the edge.

what do you do when the main symptom of your illness is one that hurts and offends lots of people just by talking about it, even if you aren't directing that symptom at anyone in particular and are just talking about how you feel?

"I wrote a poem to my wife (this ended up being really long by the time I contextualized the poem) I started drinking in 2007.  It got progressively worse (as it does).  Back then it was for fun, with friends, and I thought it made playing video games and entertaining myself really fun.  I then started to use it as a coping mechanism to deal with my ex-wife.  We divorced but I didnt stop drinking.

In the meantime (2013) I met and manage to woo the girl of my dreams.  Beautiful, smart, argumentative about religion, politics etc and never takes losing or winning a debate too far (we’ve only ever had 1 real argument in which we ended up upset)... I have, however, hurt her in drunken tirades.  She has always been stone cold when I get hostile, patiently waits out my fits, and then holds me while I sob myself to sleep.  A perfect angel whose love I’ve basically been abusing because I won’t stop drinking.  The awful things I have said in my angry drunkenness should have left me out in the streets alone.  But she never gave up on me.

I hit the lowest point in my life last February when I lost my job (actually for reasons not related to alcohol).  I could barely hold myself together, and my wife was there to glue me back together again.  Every hangover, every drunken fit, outrage, tantrum.  I was killing 15-20 beers a night, rapidly drinking right through our savings.  Didnt get another job until August.

In June she went into the hospital with chest pains caused by stress.

I was doing this to her, and even after a hospital visit, I didn’t see it.

I found Reddit in December of last year.  I started off on the typical funny subs or entertaining subs.  Then I don’t know how, but I stumbled onto some of the many support subs for alcoholics.

And it scared me shitless.  The consequences of drinking are all over the place.  I kind of had a wakeup call when I realized that thanks to my wife, I have probably been saved from DUIs and PI citations or worse.

I have been tapering down my drinking.  Around 6 a night.  I dont have insurance and live in the US, otherwise I would have checked into rehab already.  I looked at TSM and other alternatives... but right now I think my best bet is to taper out and then quit cold once I go a few days and make sure I dont get hit by DTs.  Regardless, I’m determined to quit and this is my first (semi) public acknowledgement of my intent to quit.  I am looking into my local AA resources, but I’m an agnostic bordering on atheism so I hope they’ll be open-minded about me clinging to an unconventional higher power on my journey through the steps.

Anyway, I wrote this poem for my wife to thank her for not giving up on me.  When we were dating I wrote her all kinds of poetry and I kept writing after we got married, but the worse my drinking got, even the poems stopped.  Here it is:

How all of it hurts you

Sick. Sad.
Can’t focus, blurry vision
I passed out in the floor again
Never bad enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Quiet. Sober.
Can’t stop shaking, still can’t focus
Your worry and concern showing again
Never bad enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Angry. Confused.
Can’t laugh, can’t cry
I diagnosed all of humanities problems again
Don’t care enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Awake. Anxious.
Can’t sleep, can’t rest
I drank a few beers less again
Starting to care and see
How all of it hurts me

Trapped. Concerned.
Can’t help, can’t stop it
The fear is in your eyes again
That’s when I knew
How all of it hurts you

Improving. Striving.
Can help, can stop
The color of our laughter painting happiness again
I’ll do what I need to do
So none of it hurts you

Clean. Sober.
You helped, I stopped.
Our lives are much better again
Thanks to you I could finally see
How all of it was hurting me

"I don't know if this actually happened to me or not. I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

"Consistency of social skills with autism? To my understanding, autism is a persistent way of thinking/behaving present from birth that doesn’t “go away” and is present 24/7. 

Any of you feel as though some days you socialize better than others? Any days where you can pick up on social cues/facial expressions easily, but others it’s hard to care enough to pay attention to any of it?

"A Walking Amnesiac Does anyone else have no ability to make memories? I don't remember anything, nothing episodic at least.

I might remember the fact that I went somewhere but I won't actually be able to recall a memory about it. There's just nothing there.

"Concerta Anxiety/Depression (Help?) I’m 17 and currently on 36mg (early-release) of Concerta. I have been on ADHD medications since was 8 years old. I’ve been on Daytrana, Adderal, and Ritalin. I have been taking only Concerta for a couple of years now. I’ve had periods of severe anxiety and depression. I’ve spoke with a psychologist and much much more. I’ve noticed if a miss 1 dose of Concerta, I undergo a whole week of withdrawal symptoms. I also had an adverse reaction to doxycycline which gave me similar symptoms to that of Concerta but on a much more intense level. 

A couple weeks ago we refilled my Concerta ex and the pills were a different shape leading me to beleive maybe it’s a different brand of Concerta, I can’t necessarily remember what I had prior. Although starting Tuesday of 12/19/17 I’ve been having Anxiety with multiple panic attacks each day and depression. Last week my symptoms got worse, more intense depression and anxiety. Within the last few days I’ve notice a loss in appetite, dry mouth, fast and irregular heart beat, shortness of breath on standing, dizziness, chills in hands and feet, headaches, irritability, insomnia, obviously still depression but not as bad, and still some pretty bad anxiety. Sometimes these symptoms are more prevelant in the morning prior to me taking my dose and at night. 

My question is, has anyone experienced anything like this while on Concerta, or am I just crazy. I’m not even sure I just need some hope and something to look forward too because I don’t wanna be stuck like this. I’m going to the doctors soon to try and get weened off Concerta, I would really like other people’s input.

"Need advice on how to help my Father. I (25+M) have an alcoholic father(50+M). I do not like alcohol, I've seen what it did to my late grandpa, I am aware of what it does to innocent people, and I see what it has done to my father. He is in denial even though he recently got arrested for DUI, and had been living in his friends garage for the last 5 years smashing cases of Keystone and Busch, chainsmoking, and eating once a day. He would hold a job for 6 months to a year, then would be on the hunt again. Recently he was offered the opportunity to move in with a family member and took it, moving away from a failed 15+yr relationship with a stepchild and my nieces for a ""fresh start"". Well, he got a DUI while moving. Knowing how I feel about booze and drinking and driving he has to audacity to call me at 2am and demand I come get him from jail(over an hour away), completely unapologetic to me with this blasé attitude downplaying the severity of his charge and it associated dangers. Whatever. Since then it seemed like he was doing better, only had a beer or two here and there that we were aware of, found a job etc.. Long story short, this past weekend he showed up to work drunk(1.5 hours from home), got fired, and proceeded to walk off into the city. Family went to look for him, he turned his phone off or it died, and I am pretty sure had a missing persons filed by my family and his boss. He finally turned his phone on, someone went and picked him up and got him home, still had the same old blasé attitude and still thinks he is in control of his drinking... We are at wits end, it is fucking with my emotions, and I am genuinely growing tired of being an adult dealing with this shit from my father. I want him to get help, I want my fucking Dad back, I am tired of worrying, and I am done bailing him out. 

My main reason for coming here is to get that shit off my chest. I am too embarassed to speak to anyone I actually know, and they wouldn't be of any help any how. How can you convince someone they need help? If we do get through to him, he needs inpatient rehab. My family is talking about Trosa, but the program is extremely long(1+yr?) and contact is extremely limited from what I can tell. Idk, that is why I am here. I need advice.

"I wrote this after an interesting night. I have never been the best at expressing how i feel
These thoughts in my head move at the speed of light
If i could just catch one, find the words to make it real
I could make you see that i never want to fight

Trapped in a body that won’t cooperate
I watch in horror as i push you away
If only words could set this straight
But these words will never reach you anyway

Hoping to find the perfect combination of lines

Im a fucking hypocrite

Do i ruin things on purpose, because it is safer to fail?
Or is this how i am but i am too scared to admit it?
These excuses are beginning to feel like a whale,
Because at the end of the day i know i just don't do shit.

Let me try to explain what this ADHD does to me
And hope that these aren't more excuses for my douchebaggery 


I've been told this disorder fucks up my brain
Making rewards that are instant seem like an emergency,
Than those that are longer no matter how plain
I can want, i can need, but to no avail nothing gets done, and i scream internally.

So i take my drugs at an attempt for normalcy
But i just become detached and ravage anything in front of me
It is still hard to focus on what is needed
No matter how many times i've begged and pleaded.

At the end of the day my brain is left empty
The need for completion satisfied, even if nothing got done.
I cease wanting to do anything, and thoughts just don't come.
I could say im a zombie but that isn't quite true, as with anything there is a dichotomy.

That last stanza is terrible but i've stopped caring
My only goal is to help you understand,
To help ME understand
Just what the fuck is wrong with me.

I am never sure what is me and what is the medicine
I believe that blaming my disorder cripples me
But i also know that pretending im normal just makes me depressed
I think i need therapy.

TL;DR I probably need therapy",adhd,adhd

I'm a university student with ADD.

Namely that I need to start keeping a schedule. I spoke to my disability services advisor at school, and that lead to the determination that I need to find ways to more rigidly organize my time, and that I need to have multiple instances of schedules and reminder systems available as often as possible.

"Recently realized I have issues with working memory, some thoughts. So while researching working memory I took this test:
http://opencoglab.org/memtest1/

Looking at comments on people who have taken this test, it looks like a lot of people are getting in the 50s. I took the test twice and I was pretty consistent (34 and 38) which the test reportedly says is ""average"", yet the results on test itself are reportedly a good 10 points higher.

I have had ADHD all of my life (was diagnosed when I was around 20 years old), and just recently figured out that I may have some pretty significant issues with my working memory, despite not having issues elsewhere (I'm a programmer, and this seems like a recurring thread, at least in threads I've read so far). I've never actually done anything to navigate the couple of shortcomings that come with the ""Disability"" (I don't even classify it as one).

I think I have a huge issue *recalling* information to working memory, especially while under any type of pressure.

"What are the best non-medication treatments for ADHD? Any personal experience would be much appreciated I have adhd and it has affected me for a very long time, it seemed to get much worse in adulthood than when I was a kid. I can’t read for more than 15 minutes at a time without getting distracted, or if there is the slightest bit of noise or people talking I can’t concentrate on anything.


I can’t take stimulant medications for a couple of reasons. I have a history of drug abuse and a very addictive personality. I was on dexamphetamine at one point but abused it a lot so I stopped using it, the same has happened with Ritalin and Concerta (adderall is not available where I live). I can’t tolerate strattera, and I am already taking medication for bipolar so I would prefer not to take any more meds.


In addition, my brother who has adhd and is on dex has likely had some damage after being in it for so long. Even with the dose he takes he can’t concentrate like he used to, and if he doesn’t take it one day he will essentially be unable to function the whole day. Even my dad who is only on 5mg of dex per day will be like that if he doesn’t take it even on days he’s not working.


I also have really bad OCD so I’m in a bit of a pickle to say the least. I’m unemployed at the moment, and I have been for over a year. I am trying my hardest to apply for jobs but it’s so hard for me to concentrate. Throughout high school and university I still had it but now my symptoms have really gotten worse (I’m 24 now).

My story starts off basic for about a year and half I would get on the bus to go to college but find it difficult to look people in the eye and continue eye contact I later could not stop doing this and on one to one interviews with teachers or getting jobs I could not keep eye contact

&amp;#x200B;

I later then started to drink with my friends socials and we would go out and drink but apparently I only remember this once as my friends told me in the morning I would say things such as the FBI are following us or they are plotting against us and then a few times I ran into some bushes 

&amp;#x200B;

later my life went more and more downhill and at night I started hearing a voice at first it was positive it was hard to distinguish if I was controlling what it was saying or if it had a mind of its own

Then as life got worse it started saying negative stuff and my inner monologue voice would start ageing with it but then it started to tell me no one cares , what do you have to live for that sort of thing and then I got image flashes of myself burning a lighter against my arm and then started thinking of self harm the weird part is I wanted to listen and do what the voice told me 

&amp;#x200B;

this voice is usually a voice from a villain from a TV show but sometimes it does this weird cycle where it would say a sentence but change voice throughout speaking the sentence it would start villain, my own voice, my friend voice and so on

"Please talk to me about visual hallucinations. Visual hallucinations in schizophrenia have always fascinated me, yet despite over 15 years trying to understand them, I just don't. The concept seems so farfetched for me that I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like. 

What I'd like to know is whether the hallucinations are more like augmented reality, where the visuals present themselves as additions to the real world, or if they are 100% overlays, as in what's really there is completely hijacked by what you're seeing, which might as well be a dream or a virtual simulation? Most of the reading I've done suggests that most hallucinations belong to the former camp, where baseline reality is still in tact, albeit with your minds additions, i.e. a person who's not really there or a group of people trying to chase you down. I'm really interested to learn more about what I refer to as ""100% overlays"", where you can be in your dining room, but can be seeing something completely different, like, for example, yourself rowing a boat in the middle of the ocean or in the midst of a big bloody battle. 

How do you know when a vision is starting? Do they fade in gradually or can the onset happen instantly, at the blink of an eye? How do they go away? How long can they last? Are the visual hallucinations always accompanied by auditory ones? 

How real do these visions get? Are they detailed in the sense that the fabrications you see still adhere to laws of the real physical world? i.e. do imaginary people have shadows, do they leave footsteps in the rain/snow/mud, etc. 

Would you say that schizophrenic hallucinations are extremely realistic daydreams/fantasies? 

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to indulge my curiosities. 

P.S. I've seen several folks in the ""schizophrenia in films"" thread cite A Beautiful Mind as a pretty accurate depiction. I guess in Dr. Nash's case- based off the film-, his hallucinations were more like augmented reality, seeing as all the places his visions existed were there, in front of him, but they (the visions) were extremely vivid, complex, deep, almost to the point of completely taking over his reality.

"Meds made me fat; being fat made me get obstructive sleep apnoea Anyone else have sleep apnoea? I am currently not on medication but having sleep apnoea has made me feel like I am on olanzapine almost, I am extremely fatigued during the day (but I also wake up when at night/earlier), can't concentrate on anything, extremely forgetful and foggy-headed, can't really do much at all and am like a zombie. I can't do anything I want to do, my day-to-day life is hell - and worse, because all the things that I like to occupy my time with and give me a sense of purpose and meaning, that help me cope and manage my symptoms, I can't do because of sleep apnoea... I've even been thinking about committing suicide because I am so miserable and frustrated and hopeless because of this.

I am currently in the long process of attempting to do something about it.

"Effects on Identity If you do not have a solid base in who you are, this illness is even more so detrimental. It fills your mind with so much negativity, from harsh voices to dark thoughts. 

It makes you feel like a bad person for your mind's ability to produce such things in the first place. You constantly question who you are amid symptoms as it is difficult to separate yourself from this illness.

You begin to believe that you are in fact as awful as what your mind represents. Thankfully, over time, with a proper treatment plan that includes therapy, you decipher yourself amongst the muck.

"Did anyone else with PTSD who watched James' McAvoy's film ""Split"" find it weirdly inspirational? I realize this might seems like a strange question. James McAvoy's character was obviously very fucked in the head. But there were parts of the story that I found strangely uplifting for anyone with a history of trauma. The idea that someone who went through horrendous trauma could basically modify their epigentic profile on such a radical level to create something like ""the beast"" based on pure belief about who they were...is pretty incredible. Also, the idea that he not only let the girl go with a history of self-injury and being molested, but basically called her the next step in human evolution/gave her this sense of power she'd never had before...was something to watch. Most of the time perpetrators prey on who they think are easy targets, people with a past history of trauma...and this was a complete reversal of that. There have been plenty of times when I didn't say a word about anything in my past, any trauma, but felt like assholes/psychos/creeps could smell it on me...maybe reading into some kind of body language or vibe I was giving off..and my instincts were always right on the money. I pick up on A, B, and C, quicker and quicker now and I don't give them the time of day, but still it seems like a never ending cycle of my version of swatting.

"[PROJECT] Lethe - An interactive story about psychotic disorders Hi there!  


I'm working on my college final year project. The idea is to create an interactive fiction story, in which the user is also the protagonist. I've always been so interested in how people with psychotic disorders perceive the world, and I thought this might be an opportunity to show people what it can be like living with hallucinations and delusions. I want people to empathize and get to know mental illness, rather than staying in ignorance, making assumptions and feeding the stigma.  


I've made my research in fiction, and very often people with schizophrenia are portrayed as crazy, brutal, violent, insensitive and dehumanized beings. On the other hand, I stumbled across Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (a videogame which I believe treats mental illness in the right way) and I was fascinated. I want to get close to that game's vibe.  


So I'm about to begin writing the actual story, and build the fictional world's imaginary, and wanted to ask people that suffer delusions and hallucinations your experience. My idea is to try to depict all of these experiences through video and audio, to create a compelling and ""real"" atmosphere around the text that the user will be reading. I hope I have explained myself clear enough. Any comment or suggestion would also be much appreciated! I'll leave some questions that might help:  


What do you hear? Are voices clear or distorted? What do you see? Are your visions kind of blurry or defined? What triggers your hallucinations? What delusions do you have? What is your perception of the world?

"I got the results of my diagnosis. Welp, turns out I don't have autism, because the doctors said that my ""symptoms"" are much more aligned with anxiety (even though anxiety is a part of autism?). I already have been professionally diagnosed with anxiety a couple years ago and I take medicine for it. I guess all I can say is that I'm really disappointed, partly because many things that I feel can't be explained with the label of just an anxiety disorder, nor have I ever seen the things that I feel (which I suspected to be part of asd) even once talked about on the anxiety subreddit.

I'm also saddened because reading everyone's submissions in neurodiversity subreddits made me feel accepted and not alone in what I was feeling. I felt like I finally belonged somewhere when talking with you guys, like I could finally understand myself.

I'm not going to argue with the doctors even though every online evaluation that I've took said that I could very likely be on the spectrum, and I'm not a stupid kid either that thinks they can just randomly diagnose themselves with serious things like this. Because my parents also know the results, they think I *am* just a stupid kid that tries to self-diagnose themself.

"Diagnosed as an adult, and it turns out my mom knew from childhood that I had ADHD. How can I forgive her after a lifetime of struggles? Hi there!

I’m really excited to have found this group. I am 23/f and was diagnosed about two months ago with severe combo type. 

My psychiatrist showed me my Quotient test scores and just how alarmingly poor they were.  She started me on medication immediately (seriously, like a half hour) after she received the scores. Luckily for me I work in the same hospital as her!!

This game as a huge relief. My doctor said it wasn’t uncommon for women (especially around my age group) to go without diagnosis. However, when I told my mom, she told me that she had always known!!

She revealed that not only was she diagnosed, but that as I child I was also!! She didn’t go into details, but I do vaguely remember getting an IQ test and some other tests like that. I was in a gifted program, and I wonder if she ignored it because she was pleased with the high IQ and figured it would balance itself out?

I am obviously happy that I get to start my best life, but I am very sad that I faced so many setbacks as a result of not having known this sooner. I’ve lost so many friends, jobs, and GOD DAMN DEBIT CARDS!!!!!!!!!

"Does anyone else think they thought themselves into an ED? If there was ever a tally of how many times I've thought about the perfect way to eat, the perfect time to eat, the perfect exercise routine, the perfect this, the perfect that, I wouldn't be surprised if in total that figure clocked over a million times... Seriously. If you consider the 6 years I've been at this. I've gone over and over things concerning food and eating to the point where I used my own ability to think to create the obsession with food purely because I decided to constantly think about it a million different ways there by keeping it firmly locked in my mind. You'll probably become obsessed with anything you do a million times. I've turned food into something it never was at the beginning. Before dieting food never crossed my mind until it was time to eat. Anyone remember those days? Yeah I would emotionally eat on the occasion but before dieting it was just as effective as taking a walk or calling a friend. I never felt shame or guilt afterwards. I felt good. The shame &amp; guilt only came in after dieting because I knew eating more = diet ruined. There was no wrong before trying to lose weight. And I'm also beginning to think having an ED is synonymous with being a perfectionist. Whatever a perfectionist is defined as. Maybe there should be a dark side of perfection called an obsessioner. 

If I thought my way here would it be farfetched to say I could also think my way out of it? Not in the sense of thinking about not wanting to think about food but to proactively and repeatedly choose to think otherwise instead of further engage in the thoughts that come up to dwell on food or binge eating. If I eat a satisfying breakfast and immediately I have a thought to eat something else because that's what I always do, technically that thought is a lie, I don't need that extra food no matter what my mind says. I don't have to accept the lie. What's going to happen if I don't accept it? It's like the build up of lies I've believed as facts so I crumble at any temptation or desire to engage in more disordered thinking and eating. 

When I think about it, my obsession with food is much more unhealthy than the food choices I'm making. I must be lying to myself when I say I want to be normal around food but I ""just can't"". The truth is, I can but I just don't want to abandon this disordered way of eating/thinking which has become my sole refuge, my identity, my enjoyment because I lack the bravery needed to experience life without it.

"Should I Bring My Neuropsych Eval. Results? I initially sought MH care back in April with a Psychiatrist that I'm still seeing now. I went in after the culmination of intersocial relationship stress and personal difficulties with more emphasis on the former than the latter. I hadn't talked to a psychiatrist since I was maybe 11, but was intensely treated from 7-11 because of ""depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts"" which is so frustrating for me to talk about because of the age I was at and how people thought I was suicidal when I was really in a cycle of trying to understand what death was and couldn't stop talking about it to everyone. My doctor back then tried to diagnose me as OCD (after other beliefs from teachers thought I had ADHD) with anxiety induced depression but it never really stuck because I didn't respond to any SSRI type medication nor did I feel like I was depressed--it all came back to knowing I had to go through it because of my ""bad behavior."" My parents split when I was 13 and it rocked my world as far as routine and structure go and I pretty much drifted through 3 different high schools until joining the Army at 17. I got out in 2015 after about 4 years and have been going to College but have been in a downhill spiral ever since. 

&amp;#x200B;

My psychiatrist referred me for a Neuropsychological Evaluation to help narrow things down after treatment with stimulant medication was the first successful thing I've had in my entire life ( ridiculous things I changed my winter tires to summer after 2 years of consecutive driving on the winters). I felt the difference immediately, however, I still felt the same things that stressed me out--I no longer feel an incessant need to mask myself and also find comfortably stimming and suddenly realizing I don't remember how long I was rubbing my thighs and rocking while eating but I used to do it as a kid constantly and my mom would yell at me as if I was wiping my hands on my pants (which was partially true).

&amp;#x200B;

  I was diagnosed with ADHD-C comorbid with OCD--my problem is in how my OCD was ""evaluated."" The doctor literally handed me a pamphlet at the end of the 8-hour exam in which I would check to mark each type of Obsession I've had in the past or present. I was so angry because I had most of the obsessive thoughts but none of my compulsions are actually compulsions. When I returned to my Psychiatrist he had reviewed the findings and was frustrated with the evaluator as her feedback ""didn't make sense"" to him. He heavily suspects that I'm on the spectrum as he's helped me identify that most of my ""triggers"" are sensory based and prompt impulsive reactions. For instance: When I walk, I don't care how many steps I'm taking, I only have a problem when I step on something that feels significantly different than the routine ground I'm stepping on and I usually have to step on whatever it was with the opposite foot in the same respective spot--When I'm around other people I'm not afraid their breath is going to somehow contaminate my skin, I just am too aware of the scent of their breath and it becomes overpowering to where I'm almost holding my breath or placing myself to not be downwind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm attending an appointment today with a Clinical Psychologist in pursuit of therapy and the clinic this doctor works in has spectrum-specific resources and evaluations.

"It's almost impossible for me to sleep alone Bear with me, because this is a very long story. I just feel that the details behind the situation are important.  

During my spring semester of junior year in college, I slept alone in my campus suite many times because two of my roommates were studying abroad, and my other roommate would sleep at her boyfriend's a lot (there's 4 of us total). I never had any major issues with sleeping alone in the past, but starting in around February/March, I would hear extremely disturbing noises that sounded like it was coming from one of the other apartment units near me. When I say extremely disturbing noises, it was pretty much the epitome of a girl getting raped by her boyfriend (the noises were so detailed that I could even hear the conversations and name of the boy, and it just sounded like it was a relationship). 

The first night it happened, at around 3am, I tried to ignore it because I couldn't tell if I was actually hearing what I was hearing (I was also really high and sometimes my hearing is altered when I'm high), but when I heard the loudest coherent scream, I immediately jumped out of my bed and tried to see where it was coming from. I roamed all the hallways on my floor and the one below me (I'm the top floor). Literally no sound from anywhere. 

The noises were pretty consistent, I got many of my building's RA's involved, and it was just a really black and white situation where they couldn't do much about it. The sketchy part was that when I described the situation to the RA's, they all gave similar reactions, the ""Oh, I think I know what you're talking about"" type of reaction. Because of confidentiality reasons I guess, they really couldn't do or say much to me, other than that ""they were there for me if I needed to talk about it."" It was frustrating, but I kind of just let it go for a bit and continued hearing the noises.

I started to think I was maybe crazy or even schizophrenic, I was getting absolutely no clarity or solution to what was happening. It sucked because there really wasn't anything I could do. The worst nights where when I thought this girl was in real danger (her screaming things like ""somebody help"" or ""please stop"" at the top her lungs). I would up crying traumatized by the noises and my helplessness. Every time I called the RA's, nothing would be resolved, I didn't even know if they checked the halls to try to navigate the noise. 

So, a lot of this continues, where I would try to ignore it certain nights (this wasn't something that would occur every single night, but at least a couple of few times a week), hear too gruesome things some nights that resulted in me calling the RA's, and then nothing really getting done. I lost so much sleep that semester.

Throughout all this, I mentioned it to my roommate and asked if she could stay with me a few nights instead of her boyfriend. She doesn't have the best hearing, but when there were extremely bad and loud screams, she would hear it as well. She even cried the first time she heard it because it was disturbing and distinct. We had absolutely no idea where it was coming from. 

This experience is what traumatized me the most: when I was alone in the apartment one Thursday night, many students were going out, and typically they'd come home around 2-3 am ish. During this time, I hear some girls in a suite near me, and I have never heard the loudest cries for help in my life, along with a guy's voice yelling ""shut the fuck up"" and loud and consistent banging. The sound was so loud and clear that I was almost sure it was next door. I broke down and thought I was going to die or something (sounds dramatic, but damn it was fucking scary), but my resident director, who lives across from me, knocked on a door and I could hear her yelling to open the door, and then another man's voice. I thought the situation was gonna be taken cared of, but an hour passed and I STILL heard screaming. I called my campus police. I have never called my campus police or 911 before, but I actually thought my life was in danger. It was a very scary moment.  

The police show up, and they get some info from, I tell them how I've been hearing concerning noises the past few months, but it escalated extremely tonight. I also told them I heard my RD get involved, but the noises continued for a bit and stopped again. They tell me to get some rest and that I would get an update the following morning. I heard them knock on my RD's door, and they went inside so I couldn't hear what was discussed, but they literally didn't even knock on any door around me. They did, however, go immediately downstairs to the suite below me, and I hear them knocking for what felt like hours, banging on the door, screaming at the boys' suite to open the door. It was SO loud and clear, I also heard a girl scream, ""just open the fucking door."" I didn't know if campus police didn't have a right to go into the suite or whatever, but the whole situation was just fucked. 

I didn't sleep that night, couldn't study for my Accounting exam, and couldn't even make it to my class because of how sleep deprived I was. It was really taking a toll on my daily life, hearing the slightest banging noises in any environment made me so jumpy too. I never got an update on the situation from the campus police, so I call them myself in the afternoon, and they literally said that THE NOISE COMPLAINT WAS FROM A TV. Wtf?? None of it made sense. 

Then, one night AGAIN,  (I was probably seen as the crazy resident of my building by my RA's), intense noises occur, and I call the RA on duty. He comes upstairs and stays for a bit, and hears some of the noises. He literally looks at me, points up the ceiling, and goes, ""these are coming from upstairs...you live on the top floor..."". I'm lost, and he goes ""I don't wanna freak you out or anything but...you have been reporting these noises a lot at 3am. 3am is witching hour...you have, like, a LOT of mirrors in your suite...those are portals for spirits...the full moon was last week, when you called the police..."" So, as he's saying all this I'm like what the fuck. I'm not a firm believer of ghosts, but everything he was saying was freaking me the fuck out. He suggests I buy some incense and holy water, bless my room, and this guy literally asks if I want a hug and leaves. (that part was kinda funny tho lmao). So I live the next few weeks of school believing I was truly being haunted by a bunch of ghosts. This all happens close to the end of the semester, so I was moving out soon. 

This entire experience was extremely traumatizing for me, especially that one night where I called the police. Still don't know whether it was spirits or real people, but I have an irrational fear every single night that my place will be invaded or that I will be choked by a ghost or something. I rarely slept alone after moving out though, because I spent a lot of time staying at my boyfriend's place. But the times I did sleep alone, I would always hear the SAME noises, or I just could not fall asleep because my heart would be racing so much from fear that I wasn't safe or something. When I would sleep with my boyfriend, I would still get jumpy from any slight noise, but having his presence obviously made things much better.

I interned in another city this summer and got a place alone (yeah sounds really stupid now that I think about it, but I don't think I understood how bad it was to actually sleep alone after the experience at school), and every time I would sleep alone, I would be scared out of my mind and couldn't fall asleep for hours. I got lucky because my boyfriend moved to the same city full time to start his job (he's a year older), so we were able to spend a lot of nights together throughout the summer. 

Now that I'm back home, I have not been able to sleep alone in my room because I am the only one sleeping on my floor (parent's master bedroom is on the third floor and my older brother has already moved out of our house). I've been going upstairs to my parents' room every single night to sleep with my mom since my dad is out of town on a business trip right now, and it's so embarrassing. Thankfully, my mom is the sweetest and most caring woman on this planet, so she takes it all ready well and is understanding. She was actually the first person I called before calling the police the night of the incident. Last night, I went upstairs to sleep with my mom again, because I thought I heard footsteps near my bedroom (we live in a house, not an apartment btw), and was almost convinced we were having a home invasion. I had to call my mom to come downstairs so I could go up with her (damn, typing it all out actually makes it sound so much worse), and slept upstairs again. But the scary thing is, even when I had earplugs in last night, I started to hear the same girls' voice in my head. It sounded so real, I even got scared for a second that it WAS real, but obviously it wasn't. That also wasn't the first time it happened, where I think about the noises before sleeping, and I hear it again just by thinking about it. 

So, given the past situation/incident and what's been going on with me after it, does it sound like PTSD?? It's taken a huge toll on my sleep when I'm alone. The only thing is that it hasn't really taken a toll on my daily life after moving out, as this is only something I fear at night, alone. I guess my biggest fear is a combo of having my home invaded and coming across a spirit of some kind. Not really sure what to do, not really sure what I wanted to get out of this post, but glad I got to really write out in detail what i've been going through.

TLDR; I consistently heard disturbing noises last semester at school and can't sleep alone now because I have developed a fear of a home invasion and ghosts.",ptsd,ptsd

"Is having a really bad memory common? I'm just gonna cut it short before I get sidetracked and start going to deep.

SO, I have an awful memory. I can't remember the past few hours of the day, nor try to make an attempt to recollect the past few days, weeks, or months. It's almost as if unless something DRASTIC happens such as, a car accident, or something to that extent. I almost never am able to recall anything. This is a real detriment to my school life along with my relationship. It's been this way for a long time, and when I stop taking my meds (Adderall) the problem gets drastically worse. To the point where I am essentially just living in the moment and nothing else is a concern.

"When you try to get faster/more accurate at your job, but don't improve: how do you demonstrate to your employer that you're trying your hardest? (x-posted to /r/jobs).   I am really slow at my job, to the point that I'm routinely staying 1-2 hours late to get work completed. This is an hourly, not salaried position, and my company doesn't like to give overtime. I was getting in trouble for working too late since they are required to pay overtime, so now I clock out at my normal time and just stay late off the clock. I haven't been telling them that I'm still staying late, because I don't want to get reprimanded again. (Although I suspect they are catching on to the fact that I'm staying late because there are some emails I'm sending out/documents I'm saving after I clocked out). If I don't stay late, I won't get all the paperwork completed, which will result in me getting in trouble.

Since I have ADHD and a learning disability, organization is one of the areas I struggle with. This job is very paperwork intensive and requires a lot of multitasking. When I try to do one thing at a time, I have to stay super late, but when I multitask I end up making a lot of mistakes. Either way, my performance is bad. I just want to pass my probationary period and have longevity at a job for once. I have a track record of getting fired or being forced to resign. Having career stability will do wonders for my finances and my emotional health.

When I make errors and/or end up staying late, I get talked to about how I need to get faster, more organized, and stop making so many mistakes. I am always respectful when responding (""Thank you for letting me know. I am working on improving with this""), but I'm worried it comes off as insincere since I keep doing the same things wrong over and over again. I don't want them to think that I'm not taking their feedback into account and that I'm just saying this on autopilot. Does anyone have advice for how to convey that I am trying my hardest and will continue to work on improving, without making promises that I can't keep? Saying ""I won't make this error again"" or ""I will make sure next time I'll finish XYZ document earlier"" would be a lie. I don't want to overpromise and underdeliver No matter how hard I try, it will probably still happen. But saying ""I'll TRY not to do this again"" probably doesn't sound like a satisfactory answer. They don't want me to just try - they want me to fix the issue period).

Something I've been finding is that I get caught off guard when my boss says ""It shouldn't take you X hours to complete Documents A, B, and C. What have you been doing all this time?"" I always fumble around trying to explain myself. I genuinely have been working the entire time, but I am worried it sounds like I'm just making excuses for myself. Saying ""well, I was completing Document A for the past two hours"" probably sounds ridiculous, if it only takes other employees 45 minutes to complete Document A, and within those two hours they would have already gotten to Document B &amp; C. I bet my boss is still wondering in her head ""okay, she couldn't have possibly been doing just Document A all this time. She probably was dicking around."" The more I try to explain myself, the more ridiculous it all sounds. (""Well, I was getting a little hung up on the first page of Document A. I wanted to go back into the database and double check XYZ. Then when I closed out the database, I realized that I had to reload it because I forgot to obtain Information Piece #123. After that, I needed to sort through my filing cabinet for {blahblahblah}...""). It just goes on and on and on. I feel like I am blabbering and it sounds like I'm covering for laziness - when I'm not fooling around, just being forgetful and needing to re-do certain things over and over. When my boss asks me to account for my time, is there a more effective way to go about doing this?

TL;DR:  I am slow at my job and keep making mistakes.  I am trying really hard but haven't been improving much.  I want to make it through my probationary period.  How can I demonstrate that I genuinely do care about my job to my boss?

Any advice that you guys have is very much appreciated. I want my boss to understand that I am trying my hardest and genuinely do want to be better at my job. ",adhd,adhd

"Toxic mentality to recovery I have this on-off cycle with wanting to recover. Life situations change and sometimes, even when I'm happy and steady with recovery I start losing weight unintentionally (busy work days etc) but then I continue it ""by accident"".

You know, that type of ""oops hahah I have been so busy today!!"" and ""i haven't lost weight, i've always been naturally skinny! :-)"" while drinking excessive amounts of coffee and water to curb hunger etc. I know it's harmful to my recovery progress. I'm lying to myself and others.

It feels unrealistic to ever say to anyone ""hey, can you watch out for my behavior with food? i have this need to lose weight and i keep lying to myself about it, thanks and though i am an adult i don't want to take care of myself""

I know that I should want to recover but it feels more like I want to find a way to consistently be underweight in a ""healthy"" manner. All I can think about is losing weight, if I'm not below a specific number or if my bones don't visibly pop out enough or I can't feel them with my fingers. It's all I can think about.

"How do you find a competent psychiatrist? I don't want to make this long, but it's probably going to be.......My Service Dog is the only thing keeping me from killing myself and I can't take another shitty doctor. The last one put me on meds that made me paranoid and hallucinate, and I haven't gone back. I've seen several in the area, and they've all made me worse. I only had success was with one doctor where I used to live, but they're over 3 hours away now.

I'm on medicare for my PTSD, so I don't have money to waste on useless doctor appointments and medications that I know don't work, to start at the lowest possible dosage.

I'm losing control.

I can't control my emotions. I can't stop thinking about the trauma - all day every day, whether I'm awake or sleeping, I can't distract myself. I'll have a movie playing on my laptop while I'm simultaneously playing a computer game and an Xbox game, while playing fetch with my dog, and I still can't get it out of my mind.

I'm afraid of going out in public too, I've started having my groceries delivered, and the only other place I go is a local gas station like 2 miles away when I run out groceries or don't have it in me to make something for myself to eat. I've ordered delivery food, Pizza Hut or Papa John's and would eat it all week to avoid going to the grocery store, and when I did/do go, I do it at like 3 in the morning when no one is around.

I had to go to the allergist for my asthma, and I ended up having a severe breakdown in the office because my PTSD was unmedicated. I was supposed to have tests done for my asthma, but I can't go back there, I felt embarrassed, ashamed, and I'm afraid of having another one if I go back, so I've been using Amwell to refill my asthma prescriptions. I'd use Amwell for psychiatry but because of some bullshit DEA regulation that Congress only recently allowed to be changed (the Ryan Haight Act), they can't prescribe half the medications I need.

I've tried my general practitioner, but he's not comfortable managing psychiatric meds to being with, but particularly with how severe my PTSD is.

I've gone through the Medicare website to find a doctor, but most of them are major physicians' groups that aren't taking new patients - one of those being religiously affiliated who have my religion on file as atheist (accurate, and I disclosed it when I had received services through the hospital).

Every time I see a new doctor I have to relive the trauma explaining everything, usually twice (once with in-take, and then again with the doctor), which is so extensive it takes multiple appointments. That makes my PTSD worse before I even begin treatment, and they rarely even prescribe anything until the 2nd appointment, and even then they want me on their own custom cocktail of medications regardless of how they affected me, and at the starting dose to boot. The only anti-anxiety medication that works for me is Xanax, and I was at the maximum dose when it was effective (probably because it contributes to memory loss, so hit helped me forget the trauma). And doctors won't prescribe it because of the fucking opioid epidemic and all the doctors going to jail. Trazodone gives me RLS (restless legs) which keep me up doing the opposite of the purpose of taking it.

Every time I try and get help, I feel like Tantalus of Greek mythology, made to stand in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches, with the fruit ever eluding his grasp, and the water always receding before he could take a drink. Sometimes I think my first suicide attempt was successful and this is my hell...

Nobody listens, nothing works, and no matter what I do everything gets worse.

I can't take it. And I don't know what to do anymore. Every day is an epic battle to resist killing myself, and the only people that care are more interested in my wallet than my symptoms.

"My husband's father alcoholism and impacts on my marriage. My husband's father was an alcoholic and abusive to him growing up. My husband suffers from a ton of trauma. Last year his father  committed suicide leading to him into a deep depression and starting therapy.

I have always drank around him but not an alcoholic. But if I drink too much or make any mistake involving alcohol he just labels these actions as alcoholicism. 

Today, I actually went to have an assessment to see if I was in denial about being an alcoholic. But, it was determined my experiences with alcohol might occasionally show abuse but not enough to suggest I need treatment for alcoholism. I do like to go out an party at times. I do not drive. My family life always taught me drinking was fine as long it was responsible.

I am mostly venting but tired of my husband making me feel guilty.

"Ummmmm I'm an anxious person and sometimes I drink too much just because I feel weird if I have nothing to do with my hands Hi, pretty much title.

However, over the past year I've developed some serious anxiety in social situations even though I'm always comfortable with people. I'm very extroverted, but I never know how to position myself or my body when chatting. As a result, I often grab a drink just because I want something in my hands, but then every so often I'll drink too much because if its a long night that's a lot of drinks in my hand...

"Work is stressing me out For a bit of backstory (not sure if its needed or if it will contribute to the story but here it is). when I was 13-14 One of my school teachers recommended to my parents to have me tested for ADHD because I was often late to class or almost always forgot something from my locker and wasn't very well organized. An example that my parents later used was that if I was in class and something fell off my desk or someone took something from me, even something small, I couldn't let it go. I needed to get up and get the thing that fell or get my belonging back from whoever took it, and this often disrupted the whole class and created a big scene. When these things happened the teacher always gave out to me for causing a scene but I couldn't see a problem with it because I was retrieving something of mine.

When I went to get tested for ADHD they noticed my fidgeting and lack of eye contact. They gave me a memory test where I had to listen to a woman tell me a sentence and recite it back to her and each sentence got longer and harder to remember. I got a perfect score on that test but they noticed that I had communication issues. I ended up going to a group of other kids with communication issues for a while to try help with that. They then suggested that I don't have ADHD but instead could have autism. They said that I would be quite low on the autistic spectrum and would most likely have aspergers. They way they described it to me was that on a scale from 1 to 10, I was between a 1 and a 3.

The place I was going to dealt with children under the age of 16. I was 15 when they told me this. So after they told me this they said they couldn't give a proper diagnosis because I was almost 16 and they would refer me to another place to get a diagnosis. The problem is I'm 18 now and haven't heard a thing from anyone. They told me that I have sensory issues and never went into detail of what that is or how it affects me (figured it out thanks to the internet). The problem is that I was told I could be autistic and then never heard from them again. It's really annoying me that I don't know, I would much rather either be told yes I do have autism, or no I don't.

Anyway, the main story,

I'm 18 now and I started working with my cousin as an apprentice carpenter. He owns a building company but is a qualified carpenter. Because I only started about a month and a half ago I've mainly been cleaning and getting things from the van, which is ok because I know that eventually I'll start doing other things.

The problem is that if I'm given a task I want to be told exactly what I have to do, no vague instructions. For example, today in work he asked me to clean out a room so that we could lay down floorboards. This room had painting gear, plumbing gear, doors, cuts of wood, etc (most of which belonged to different people) in it. and I knew that all of it couldn't go into the van. So I stood there in the room confused trying to figure out what to do because I had nowhere to move the stuff to. My boss came back a couple minutes later to see me standing there thinking and started telling me that I'm being lazy and I can't be standing around doing nothing. I asked him several times what I had to do and I kept getting vague answers. This annoyed and frustrated me way more than I think it should have and I feel like I'm overreacting for something that I just didn't understand. 

This is really stressing me out and I honestly don't know what to do about it because I don't want my boss to think that I'm just trying to get away with not doing any work but that's what he thinks is going on. Is it just me getting worked up over nothing?

Sorry for the rant. I honestly don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this but I feel like i need to get it out of my system.",autism,autism
"A poem about how schizophrenia feels for me. An excuse retains the answer,
But sleep won’t ever come,
Respiring thoughts of a red light,
When met with “maybe these tablets are the ones”,
Series of events maybe traumatised the chemicals,
Where does my biter lay?
How does a pill remedy the symptoms,
But skin the cat in a different way?
Trepanning seems to be a thought,
But from that hole sprouts an ugly pine,
When flies are near our skin,
We are irritated by the outside,
If you saw it walking down the street,
Would it coil you down to your core?
Would you open arms with acceptance?
Or flick the fly once more?
An unknown cause causes an unknown fear,
The tight rope wears thin and slack, 
A struggle to shuffle to the other side,
With such a weight upon my back.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"First Day of My Life So as of 7 o’clock this morning I’ve decided to give up alcohol and smoking at the same time. I don’t know if I can do it and I’m terrified because I’ve been using alcohol to combat loneliness and depression for years knowing that it actually contributes to them. I was extremely functional alcoholic though I did not like to be called an alcoholic and did not think of myself as an alcoholic until more recently when I got cancer and my marriage started to fall apart with my spouse’s cheating.

I began to use alcohol even more heavily to numb myself from the situation. Needless to say it didn’t help, and I needed more and more alcohol and developed a higher and higher tolerance trying to protect myself. My behaviors have become more erratic and ridiculous and I’m ashamed now when I look at myself in the mirror and realize this is who I’ve become. I left high school and college with amazing possibilities and ideals and I’m determined that despite being 40 years of age, I can still reach some of those possibilities. What I’m also determined is I am not going to let my spouse’s infidelities design the rest of my life because those are on him and not me.

"I am 18yrs sober but alcohol is affecting my life!9 Hey all. First time posting. I got a phone call from my 37yr old son yesterday. He told me he’d be going to detox/rehab for alcohol. I was very surprised. I knew he liked to drink socially, but didn’t know he had an alcohol problem. 

Well, he was admitted to a rehab center in Cleveland at 11am EST and that’s about 3 hours away.  He said he will have no phone for at least 2 days. I’ve been crying all morning. I’m sure somehow I influenced him. I’m just so sad this happened to him. I know the difficulties of achieving sobriety, and maintaining it. Of course I’ll be there for him, but it’s been so long ago for me!  I’m so happy that at least for now, his wife is being very supportive. He has 3 children, who were extremely upset. He’ll be in 21-28 days. I guess I’m looking for some support!  Thanks for reading!",alcoholism,alcoholism
"PTSD, or am I just over reacting? This might be triggering.

This is my first time posting here. I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.

After, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be ""getting him excited"" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. 

Ever since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. 

And that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I've been single ever since and honestly, I'm just lonely and depressed. I never spoke to a doctor about any of this. I don't know what I'd be diagnosed with but I'm afraid. 

Fast forward to now, there's a good person in my life who likes me. I think he's interested in me....I like him too but I'm still afraid. I don't know what to do or how to behave...I don't know what a good/healthy relationship is supposed to feel like. I'm just nervous all the time and its involuntary...I can't control how I feel. The new person said that I'm hard to read. Like, he doesn't know how I feel about physical touch... I'm sure he can tell that I'm nervous. I just don't want him to think that I'm not interested in him, or that I'm disgusted of him because that's not true. 

For a long time, I'd zone out...get lost in my thoughts. Oh, and nightmares. I'd have random nightmares of being attacked, violated, raped, assaulted, or just chased. Over the years I've been able to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty or shameful. I tried practicing self love for a long time and I think it helped. I feel somewhat normal but I never really learned how to cope.

People look at me on the street and I hate it, not because I look good, because I look so thin. It’s warmer weather here and I’m not as covered up as usual. 

I’m also an alcoholic in recovery and seem to be replacing one addiction with another, a never ending saga.

"I think I might have a problem with alcohol. So basically I am a 21 year old student and recently I was thinking and I realized that I can't remember a longer period of time (more than 2 weeks) that I did not drink in the last couple of years. I do not consider myself an alcoholic because I do not feel the need to drink alone or on a daily basis but I do feel that I might have a problem. Most of my friends drink alcohol and it is very common for me to drink excessively on weekends. For me it started to become a problem because I have lot of free time and when I drink a drink or two with my friends in my bar more often than not I continue to drink more and end up drunk and often with a medium hangover. Also for me drinking became the main thing to do on a weekend night and I can't think of last time I did something else besides drinking on a Friday or Saturday night. What I feel the main problem is that I feel I am a better person when I drink (not when I am pissed drunk but that sweet spot of tipsiness after 3-4 large beers). Also my friends told me that I am hilarious when I drink and honestly I do not have problems with drinking such as puking, being aggressive or injuring myself. I just like to drink and to laugh and make jokes. I guess my situation could be simmilar to what the comedian Bill Burr said : '' I am not an alcoholic, I just truly enjoy getting drunk.'', but I am starting to feel like I should cut down on it. The main reason is that sometimes, especially on a nice evening I cant wait to get the buzz from alcohol so I quickly drink my first two drinks. Usually this happens when I had drinking planned such as a party or an arranged meeting, but more often than not I just feel the need to quickly drink my drink in order to get that buzz. The best way I can describe it is to quench my thirst after a run. This started to get me worried because although I am relatively young and a lot of people my age are drinking even more and more often I just don't want to create a bad habit that could potentially get worse. 

I would like to ask you dear redditors if you think I do have a problem with alcohol and it would help me a lot if you have been in a simmilar situation or have any advice. I hope this was more or less comprehensible and kind regards.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Is alcohol a problem for ALL middle-aged men? It's crushing us. Throwaway because I'm not comfortable revealing this information otherwise...

&amp;#x200B;

So my dad, who I love to death, has been struggling with an addiction to alcohol for (apparently) most of his adult life. My siblings and I did not really realize the severity of his addiction until we were old enough to understand. We are all in our mid 20's and early 30's at this point, and it has really become a big issue for us recently.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has revealed to us that he's always been this way, and that she's really never been happy because of it. My parents don't hang out or do anything together, and have their own separate interests/friends. I guess it's just crushing all of us kids because we grew up thinking that our family ""had it all together."" All of us are very successful thus far... two of us (including me) run our own businesses, and have always been the top performing individuals in anything we've worked at. I'm not trying to make it sound as if our family is better than anyone else's (because we're definitely not), but it's just really hard for us to grasp it all since we were raised thinking we had a solid foundation. How did we all make it so far when this problem was right under our nose all this time?

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, my wife's father took his own life as an alcoholic last year. He was a very successful entrepreneur and provided for countless people...but somehow succumbed to the same addictive disease that inflicts millions of people. It really seems to us like almost all middle-aged men have an issue with alcohol consumption. Honestly, I'm terrified of ending up the same way, as I work in a high-stress environment (I like the drink here and there, but try and remember the dangers as to not get carried away). 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and siblings want to have an intervention with my dad, and I agree we need to say something. My father is drinking a box of wine every day (plus liquor as a supplement). We want to approach this carefully as we don't want him to retaliate.. but at this point he won't make it past 60 years if he stays on this track (he's already jaundice, and has the shakes in the morning). 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? How do we approach this conversation? We love him so much, and honestly he's such an amazing person...he just can't set the drink down. Do we push him to go to rehab? He's going to be so hurt that we feel this way, but it was self-inflicted and we just want him to be around to watch his grandchildren grow up.

But as the appointment nears and I get more hopeful about figuring out what's wrong with me, I get more scared that it's nothing and I'm just the problem myself. 

Idk if this makes sense. Also it doesn't help that when I told my best friend and mother this revelation that I may have something I didn't feel enthusiasm from them.

"I’m falling back into my eating disorder I haven’t been weighing myself for about a month, but my therapist told me I had lost weight, which isn’t good because it’s been through starving myself. Curiosity finally got the best of me and I weighed myself, and I’ve lost about 17 pounds in about a month or two. I haven’t weighed this little in years. 

But I love the way I look, and I have for a while now. That’s why this is so different from the last time my anorexia was a big part of my life. Last time, I truly hated the way I looked, and I thought that if I lost weight I could be skinny, and if I was skinny I would be beautiful, and if I was beautiful I would be happy. 

Since then, I realized I’m kind of thicc and I love it. I love the way I look. That’s why this time is so confusing for me, because the entire reason I wanted to lose weight before is gone. I don’t even consciously want to lose weight now. Eating is just super hard for me, and honestly, I think it might be related to depression instead of anorexia, at least partly. Not wanting to eat is related to the fact that eating makes me exhausted, and I kind of have this weird apathy for everything. I wonder too if I just don’t think I’m worth taking care of. 

Either way, even though I know seeing the number on the scale get smaller is bad, there’s this weird joy and sense of accomplishment I get from it.

"IOP Intensive outpatient therapy Hi there PTSD community. I'm grateful to you all. You help me feel less alone.  I'm looking for advice and a place to rant.

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression my whole life. A couple years ago I was diagnosed PTSD due to childhood trauma.  About a year ago I broke down. Quit a well paying job to focus on healing myself. Got a lower stress job, went to biweekly therapy, a new psychiatrist, and changed medications. I was still struggling, but I was doing somewhat better.  I thought If I just kept pushing through I would get better. In the last couple months I've had a resurgence of anxiety and depression. It very recently got so bad that I've been  unable to work- even at my lower stress job. It made me feel like a failure. Like, I had everything and I gave it up to feel better, but I still feel like this. It's frustrating. 

I googled some places that offered inpatient and intensive outpatient therapy. I visited two places and found a 6 week traumatic stress specific Intensive outpatient program that seems like a good fit.  Has anyone tried an IOP? Did it help you? 

I need to feel better. I want to be happy, stable, and live a full life. Ive been white knuckling my way through,  pretending I'm ok just to try to live a normal life.  I have hope that this program will help, but I'm scared of what happens if it doesn't. Any support or guidance would be appreciated.",ptsd,ptsd

"Sober now - 9 days I've been drinking beer heavily/nightly for the last 10+ years.

It started off every weekend (Fri/Sat), then later added Sun, then Thurs, etc. I was pretty depressed at the start and it was a bad decision to go that route, but unfortunately that was the choice I made.

I consider myself a functioning alcoholic. i have a career and have held my job for 20+ years. Up until 2 months ago i was married for 19 years, alcohol was a partial factor in that separation, but the problems with that marriage was also the start of my heaving drinking. I also have 2 daughters.

I'm lucky to have the luxury of working from home, so I was able to get up and just go to work in my pajamas. Rarely needed to go into the office.

I've tried a number of times to quit, and sometimes lasted 4 days, sometimes a week, 3 weeks one time.

I feel driven this time around. I'm on my own half the time, my daughters are with me the other half. When I'm alone I don't want to sit around drinking myself to sleep. When my daughters are around I don't want to endanger them by being passed out cold every night.

So I struggle a bit each day, but I get up the willpower to stop myself from giving in and buying some beer. Instead of telling myself it's just one night, I try to tell myself it will be another # of months of drinking if I do.

"ADHD AND ANGER? I’ve been experiencing this side of myself for a VERY long time and I was hoping someone out there could relate so I don’t feel so alone in feeling like this. And also so I can maybe feel better about this potentially being an ADHD side effect and not something else.

For as long as I can remember I’ve always felt this overwhelming feeling of anger and irritability around certain things. Usually this feeling occurs when things aren’t going according to planned, according to schedule or things are out of place in some way. At work for example, im a prep cook and my days are pretty much based off of a set course of action, if things are thrown off in any way or I’m pulled to a completely different task I get VERY overwhelmed VERY quickly and that turns into anger and an inability to retain information/focus. It’s almost like I black out for a second and my memory is shit and I can’t pay attention to anything in front of me AT ALL.
I’m not talking like feeling heated for a moment, I’m talking full blown anger to where I have to leave the room and either wait it out for 10 minutes or so or sometimes it gets so bad I leave the room and cry or feel the overwhelming the need to punch a wall.

Is this part of the ADHD experience or am I just completely nuts?

"I Just Need People To Understand. My Goals Seem So Unachievable. Any Advice? I just got rejected by yet another band. I practice, I put myself out there, but i'm never good enough and I think it's the ADHD. I was undiagnosed and unmedicated until a year ago, and even that doesn't help as much as I need it to. You guys have to understand, I'm 25 and have been playing guitar (and have been immersed in music theory in general) since I found my love for it around 12-13.

**12-13** I decided then that i wanted to be one of the musicians who played on talk shows (think the drummer Questlove.) I wanted to put EVERYTHING I had into learning this. The first 2 years of playing showed me rapid improvement. I felt better than my peers and felt on top of the world.

**14-15** When I got to high school, I was playing in a rock band and practicing with them multiple times a week. I was also on the ""guitar college completer"" track and took at least 3 classes every year dedicated to music. At this point I figured that I would be a private tutor like my external guitar teacher since he was the best guitarist that I had ever heard in person.

**16-17** Despite my continued efforts, I stopped getting better. My peers (many of whom were not practicing ANYWHERE near as much as I was) began to surpass me. I was still one of the top 8 or so players in my school and was the first sophomore to ever get into the after school guitar clubs. I was still confident. Then, in my last year of highschool, I didn't get into the capstone guitar/band club. Looking back, this left me heartbroken.

**18-19** Right in tow with my dream, I went to a community college for guitar and music theory. I should mention that I auditioned for a “real college,” and didn’t get in. Did I mention that my grades in all classes were pretty shit? I always thought this was due to a lack of trying. In reality, I just didn't understand how my brain learned. My Theory and ear training classes were different, however. Those were straight A's across the board.

**20** Although improving at theory and ear training, I never got any better at playing guitar. Due to not liking my teacher, some problems at home related to being transgender, and general confusion in life, I dropped out and joined the work force.I tried to beat my peers by saving to buy a rental property, doing a lot of the construction work myself (dad is a master carpenter, taught me a lot of useful hands-on skills.) I'm so shit with money that it's 5 years later and I'm more in the hole than when I started.

I missed music. I wrote some songs that had a great reception online. I joined a band of people who I thought weren't on my skill-level. After a year of pulling teeth trying to play live, We finally had our debut show. It was garbage. They kicked me out and I got officially ""rejected"" for the third time.

No Really, [Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69znfM_2-Q) to my most recent live performance. For someone who has been playing guitar as much as I have for over 10 years, this is inexcusable! I went to college for this shit and this is THE BEST that I can do.

I decided to take another break for a couple of months. As fate would have it, an AMAZING singer/guitarist reached out to me and asked if I wanted to get together and form something with him. Long story short, I was really hyped about getting in this band. They effectively were ""the music scene"" in my area and I was honored to be invited to play with them. - Yeah I got ghosted 2 weeks ago, so that's the 4th rejection i've faced.

**TL;DR -  I'm so goddamn frustrated! I feel like this is one of the paramount things I want in life. I want to be good at this, I work to be good at this, and I haven't improved at all since the time I was 15. Seriously, what the hell? Is this my life with ADHD? Am I just doomed to get really good at something for a year and then never make any progress ever again? How come no one can ever be honest with me like Simon Cowell would? If I suck, just tell me so and I won't go spending all my energy on something that's just not going to work out.**

I preserver with guitar for one primary reason - The way I feel when I'm on stage or when i imagine myself on stage is like no other. It’s the best feeling in the world for me. I hyperfocus and jump around, I feel like i’m possessed by an inner demon and it feels so good.I want to take it all the way too. I want to live the rock band dream and live in a van with 3-4 other people playing shows all around until we make it, that’s how dedicated to this I am.

I think ADHD has me screwed up in regards to this in a couple of ways.
* I have a feeling that my muscle memory doesn’t develop as quickly as it does for others. I can practice something for hours and still not have any finite control over my fingers.
* My sense of Rhythm probably sucks. I can keep a beat, but I think I get distracted mid beat and fall off the train, so to speak.
* I forget the next lick of the song. 
* Despite having a really “advanced” understanding of music theory, i’m not as good as most pianists, and my memory of scale patterns is awful.
* What was I working on last week? I guess I have to start that from the beginning. again.

And I'm no closer to playing live again.

And i feel like I should kill myself and get it over with. :/",adhd,adhd

"Wife is having problems and I don’t know what to do. Lately I’ve been thinking my wife has a drinking problem. She has increased her drinking and regularly drinks until she falls asleep or “passes out” at night. 
When she works she starts drinking when she gets home, if she’s off she basically drinks all day and can become very contentious and difficult. 

Two weeks ago, she was in quite rare form and we got into a verbal argument. She started to throw things around the house and then she started throwing things at me- glass jars from the fridge and whatever else she could grab in the kitchen. 

She broke our expensive TV by throwing something into it, she deliberately broke me glasses and my expensive blender. 

After that, she physically attacked me by charging up to me and trying to tackle me. My phone and case were damaged when this occurred. 

I am a good sized guy and was not seriously injured, but I definitely questioned what would be appropriate from a self defense standpoint. I did not engage in violence and was able to wrestle free from her and leave the house. 

She called me several times stating that I have a more serious problem than she has, which is not true, and that I am the reason she drinks. 

When that didn’t convince me to come back to the house, she threatened self harm. 

I didn’t come back to the house but stayed close enough I could ensure she was safe. 


The next morning, she told me that whatever happened that she got so upset to attack and destroy things is my fault and I should leave. 
I had planned to do so until she changed her mind. I assume she had just thought better about what had happened the night before. 

In the next few days she told me she wouldn’t be drinking anymore, but she of course has drank every day. She’ll point out that we didn’t get into an argument, etc, the next day as a way to justify the action. 


At this point, it seems evident she has no intention of trying to stop drinking. I hate it when she does because she’s just mean and argumentative now, and I’m afraid another explosive and dangerous situation will arise. 

I’m not sure what to do and I don’t even want to be around her at all now, which I’ve never felt before and we’ve been married for ten years.

"Perhaps I need to write these things down... (questions regarding experiences) So, I recently went to my psychiatrist and asked him about the possibility of schizophrenia. He said I probably don't have it, however I realized I didn't mention a whole lot of what I was experiencing when talking with him (I tend to be forgetful). I'll skim through the DSM-V symptom list and scribble down what \*might\* qualify as symptoms, I'll see if you guys think I should be writing everything down and bringing it to him next session to reconsider.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Delusions: I often have the fear that someone has broken into my house. I never heard the person break in, but I heard noises and voices in the basement. I can't sleep until I go and check through the whole basement. I also have a common fear that everyone around me is judging me. If I'm in public, I often find myself convinced that the people around me are laughing at me, talking about me, judging me. I also recently dealt with an odd situation: I thought I saw a flash from a pluming vans bumper, and I was sure it was a flash from a camera taking a picture of my license plate. I was sure the van was the cops or some other group and was sure it was stalking me (it followed me down a road). I also was sure that the car in front of me was in on this scheme, as it turned its turn-signal on after I turned mine on while the van was behind me. This dissipated as the van turned the opposite direction and later the car in front of me turned into a gas station.
2. Hallucinations: Again, bumps and voices in the basement. I also have issues with hearing someone call my name from another room when they don't or when no one is there (I'm the only person home). Often I see a car/shadow in the corner of my eye when there is no car/shadow moving. Recently I was in the living room and the dishwasher started screaming (it sounded like a woman). The dishwasher was running, but I didn't hear the screaming until several minutes after being within earshot of the dishwasher. I thought someone was screaming in the backyard at first, but after coming back inside realized the screaming came from the dishwasher. Just a few seconds before that, it sounded like my father was having a phone meeting \*inside\* the baseboard heater. There was a brief period when the dishwasher and heater sounded like they had a conversation, however through none of it could I understand specific words. I've also had the feeling of bubbles moving up my back in a triangular formation occasionally happen for years. I've also recently started noticing smells that don't seem to exist from the real word (specifically, my basement toilet has a specific odd smell that I'll occasionally smell in an entirely unrelated context, same for the smell of a coworker who has terrible hygiene).
3. Disorganized Speech: Not something I've been told I've had issues with too much, though I will explain something in a way that makes sense to me and others will quite often not understand what I'm saying. I've also had issues with making up words, though usually people know what I mean (this ranges from calling a refrigerator a ""cooly-bit"" to words like formulizing). This is probably less of an issue for me.
4. Disorganized/Catatonic Behavior: I have disorganized behavior likely due to ADHD, so I won't include what I think falls under that. However, I do have anxiety that will lead to what I think is catatonia in bad episodes(?). If I have a bad anxiety attack (for example, I had one during Halloween due to people at the door) I will become nonverbal and will stare into space in one position. I've also been told I will suddenly stop speaking mid-sentence and stare off into space, while I have no memory of changing from talking to staring into space (not related to anxiety attacks).
5. I sometimes don't feel like I have emotion, while most other times I feel like I have feelings. I don't remember, for example, crying at the funeral of a friend of mines or my grandfathers. Other times I remember laughing when a kid burst into tears in highschool (junior year, I was about 16). I felt bad for him but I don't know why I laughed.

I also know I experience depersonalization/derealization symptoms, so I know this makes diagnosis more challenging. However I know much of this is information I unintentionally left out when last talking to my psychiatrist, and I was wondering if it might change his judgement of whether or not I have schizophrenia or a related disorder.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

(I'm aware this isn't supposed to be the case long-term.) however, it seemed like pretty soon they stopped having any effect, even though i was initially only taking 10mg per day and gradually moved up to my prescribed dose of 40mg. I know you're not supposed to feel different, but i found it really hard to see a difference in my actions retrospectively either. My mother (who was pretty resistant to me getting an ADHD diagnosis and going on medication in general) often mentions she doesn't see a difference in my productivity but that I act really different coming off of ritalin (in a bad way- hostile, anxious etc) and that i'm just not noticing how severe the effects are. She only mentions this when angry, so i don't really know how much faith i can put in the idea. 

Anyway I went back to the doctor a couple days ago, where he said he'd put me on concerta (afaik it was always his intention to switch to concerta after trialling ritalin to make sure i didn't have a bad reaction to methylphenidate). I meant to bring up my concerns that ritalin wasn't working (because i genuinely have no idea if it 'worked' or not), but I never found a good time to mention it somehow (my doctor has a tendency to give out 'speeches' rather than having a conversation- it's hard to get a word in.) So, sure enough, i got a concerta prescription and was sent on my way. I'm not scheduled to see this doctor again until October. I took a concerta for the first time this morning and ended up slacking off at lunchtime when I said i'd work on a minor assignment and clean my room. My mother angrily mentioned that she didn't think the concerta was working- so i'm back in the same pattern of being unsure and feeling really stressed as a result. Is it possible that concerta can be effective for me even if ritalin wasn't? In addition, how can I tell if the concerta's working- or if ritalin was actually ineffective?",adhd,adhd

"How do I not compare myself to others? So...on Saturday I am going out for my best friends birthday. There is a girl (a model, might I add) joining us. She is so, so painfully thin, and I cant help but compare myself to her. She is obviously smaller than me, which I fucking hate. But now Im going to have to be in a resturant with her and eat, too? Think I may just end up getting drunk AF instead of eating anything. Her body is basically my goals. 

Her arms and legs are so tiny, so dainty - her hip bones jut out, her fingers are slender. Everything that Im not. Her legs are the size of my arms. No joke. And people tell me that Im skinny. 
I suspect theres something disordered going on her side too, but I cant diagnose. And Im not about to ask, because then I will feel like the failed anorexic. Shes better at it than me, because look at how much thinner she is, right? 

Im not sure how I am going to make it through the night without wanting to be swallowed up whole. Im going to try to avoid her. But she is actually super nice, and Id love to pick her brain a little. I love and hate her. Everthing I wish to be, but am not. 

Ive seen her in a bikini and Ive gotten up and personal with her body and Ive felt/touched it. (For context: Im a make up artist and my best friend is a photographer we did a swimwear shoot with this girl as the model, I had to rub her with sunscreen &amp; oil. Comes with the job, lol).

"betrayal and fear? There’s this somewhat new friend I have.. a man in his 30s like myself... 

he was being hurtful and condescending the other day, so yesterday I told him that I don’t want to talk to him anymore, how I won’t tolerate him being that way.

He said “okay, goodbye”,

and then i replied with how there’s some divide with us, how he seems
different..

then he said “you remember that girl you asked me to text?

sure you do. 
I know all about you.

(I said he’s creeping me out)

you creep everyone out buddy.
trust me”

... and then he blocked me.

Some context; Last summer I was close with this girl for a few months, and then she backed away abruptly because she had a nasty breakup with her long time (now ex) boyfriend, and needed space from all men...
and when I tried to continue talking she blocked me...

I then asked this man to send her a text of mine to her. He doesn’t know her,
he actually doesn’t even live in the same state.

a day or two after the text was sent,
i visited her at work as a surprise... she got scared and called the police to warn me not to contact her, per her request.

She also most likely blocked my friend who texted her.

Anyways, what on earth does this mean, like what he said to me? why bring up a
text he sent to a girl like 4 months ago? why say he “knows all about me”?

those are scary things to say to someone.

"I'm an 18 Year Old, Autistic Hip Hop Artist. I've been on this subreddit for a little while but I haven't posted in here before just because i haven't really known what to comment on. I was gonna post this before but I wasn't sure if people would be cool with me posting this kinda stuff in here. Anyways, let me give you a bit of background. At age 2 (it may have been 3, not sure), I was diagnosed with Aspergers. I grew up on a lot of music but what always stuck to me was Hip Hop. From like the time I was born until I was about 6, My Dad (R.I.P) went through a huge phase with Hip Hop and all he'd ever play was DMX, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G, Jay-Z, Eminem, Nas, The Game, 50 Cent, etc (Late 90s and early 2000s era Hip Hop) so that was my introduction into music. I think the earliest I can remember wanting to make music was from the age of 8, I was really feeling inspired from Kanye West and Lil Wayne at the time, I used to write things constantly. At the age of 13, I finally decided to do pursue music and ended up signing to a local label (which I shouldn't of done, but luckily I wasn't with them long so it was all good).

"My 3 years old has been maybe diagnosed with mild autism I say that because they didn’t complete the test and didn’t take my portion of questions and diagnosed him. The girl who tested him was extremely mean and boring so he didn’t want to play or be near her so she cut the test an 1.5 hrs before (he had 20 mins of testing). We are getting him tested by someone else and have definitely contacted the office and her superiors and we weren’t the only ones who filed a complaint about how she acted and how she cut the test or came up with the diagnosis. However, i know my little one could be or is just very speech delayed. He seemed to grow out of or stopped certain behaviors that made his first pediatrician think he could be (she was very confused, he didn’t seem like he was but he didn’t seem like he wasn’t- her exact words) and after a couple months of speech therapy he’s saying words while signing or just simply relating random words he hears, sees, or remembers. 

My question i guess is: if my son is diagnosed with mild autism what should i expect in his behavior for the future if he is diagnosed with mild autism? Are there any of you who have mild autism that can tell me about your behavior socially? I just want to know how to be there for him properly and how to guide him.

"Recently starting taking Vyvanse and finals week just started. Seeking advice for a smoother transition. Hi all! My first time posting on here so I'll try to briefly explain my situation. I'm midday through my Sophomore year of college and after realizing my depression was a result of my undiagnosed ADD I decided to start the process for professional help. Telling the first person was tremendously hard, but I did it. I saw a psychologist over my Winter Break and he told me it was very clear I had clinical depression, social anxiety, ADD, and an eating disorder with ADD most likely being the trigger for most. However, I would need to come back for another session for an unofficial diagnosis and my next session isn't until after this term. 


I explained the importance to him that I was close to losing my scholarship I desperately needed. Last week I found out that my GPA was coming to the point where I might lose it and the best option was to take a ""medical withdrawal"" and come back the following year. For me this was frustrating because I made incredible progress that was difficult to fight my depression and eating disorder and knew I'd be getting the medication I needed after break. I told my professors everything and they allowed extensions to make coming next term possible. 


I knew I needed medication so I got some of my friend's 40mg vyvanse (I know the guidelines no prescription=recreational, but I'm only using it because I need to). Since my finals are this week and this is a pretty important term, I had some questions and concerns to maybe help my transition quicker


Questions:

     1.) How much water do you recommend increasing the intake by? I was really turned off my first time because of the comedown and realized it was most likely a dehydration headache. 

     2.) I try and eat a decent sized meal before, but do you guys have any tips on still eating with the suppressed appetite of vyvanse? Especially important for my eating disorder. 

    3.) Will using it before I get my official diagnosis affect that process at all as long as I go into my next session not on it? 

   4.) Is there a thing as too much in the beginning? Of course there is. But for example today I had a lot to do and took 20mg probably 5 hours in between each and I'm just concerned that's too much. 


Hopefully you guys can turn a blind eye to me not having a prescription and offer some advice. Any other general things that you have learned from your own experiences with Vyvanse would be incredibly useful. I didn't know how amazing it would be. It actually allows me to direct my attention, but the most important thing is that my social anxiety is just gone. First day I took it, I finally came out to all of my close friends about my mental health. I opened up to professors that I was too afraid to talk to, and even managed to talk to some girls I had always wanted to but never had the courage to. i never realized how much social anxiety had an affect on my life until Vyvanse.

Maybe one of you can help me out, because I haven't found any information anywhere else. When I try to sleep at night, right when I close my eyes, I hear voices inside my head, but it sometimes is accompanied by other sounds (a voice talking over sirens, for example). It is never my own voice, it's either the voice of someone I know or it's an unfamiliar voice. I can't control it, what the voice says is unpredictable and beyond my control. Also, it sounds like it's inside my head, it sounds like it comes from the same place my thoughts do, if that makes sense. I can still think while I hear this voice, so I'll have my own thoughts inside my head at the same time as this other voice is inside my head. It only happens when my eyes are closed. As soon as I close them, it starts, and the voice stops as soon as I open my eyes.

I have PTSD and anxiety and have been working with my Therapist to not only set boundaries but also put myself first (I tend to put others before my needs and burn out). Boy is it hard.

I couldn’t provide the logic my mom wanted to hear. She didn’t even listen to me when I asked her to stop.

"Need to vent Have any of you heard of autism cure diets and miracle probiotics? I've been posting a lot about autism on Facebook just trying to combat damaging myths and misconceptions, trying to build a better world for us one step at a time, and it has been giving me a sense of self worth. I've even had some friends who received late diagnoses who've been openly appreciative because my posts have helped them understand their condition and how it factors into their lives much better, since they have only had a short time to understand the implications of being autistic. Anyways, Facebook has been sending me ads related to my obvious interest in ASD. They've sent me ads from Autism Speaks (they stopped after I started liking other, less antagonistic and more respectful, autism charities), a disability conference where Ari Ne'eman will be appearing as a keynote speaker (and as an autistic person who's planning on going into special ed to work with transition age students, I have 2 obvious reasons to want to attend), genetic research, etc.

So how does my initial question factor into it? I saw an advertised FB post about a probiotic autism miracle diet that claimed to fix the ""damaged gut"" we have in order to repair that ""second brain"". Being the sort who is more than willing, even if somewhat reluctant, to dive into the belly of the beast in order to understand wickedness, I decided to look into it. Filled with parents who claimed to be ""curing"" or making their kids verbal through this diet or that (and as someone who spent his early childhood nonverbal, I am more than averse to calling late speech development ""miraculous""). It all spilled over to here the moment I saw a mother claim that a gluten-free diet as a follow up to chelation was ""fixing"" her son. I really wanted to grill in to her for medically abusing her child, but it was so overwhelming that I just couldn't do it. I do hope that I find the strength, reasoned arguments, and specific data, to comfortably and confidently respond to her comments. Anyways, venting session over",autism,autism

"How many of you suffer from depression as well as ADHD? So basically, I’m torn between extreme lack of motivation (but inner irritability because I literally can’t do anything but I need mental stimulation) and extreme focus towards a goal (but it’s very fleeting &amp; leaves a huge void inside of me). 

I was wondering if anyone has any ideas to cope or whatever bc I go from “yo imma learn to cook!” To “I don’t want to eat today ._.” And then next week I’m like “i wanna learn Japanese!” And then no motivation after I try. Shit sucks ass.

"Seroquel, OCD and coincidences So I suffer from OCD and anxiety, my obsession is that I think I am becoming psychotic. This obsession has been going on for 7 months. It begun with a lot of stress, intrusive thoughts, in which I voluntairily placed myself into a mental health ward where I was diagnosed with intrusive thoughts OCD and anxiety on top of a pre existing panic disorder.

The psychiatrist prescribed me Lorazapam, an SSRI and seroquel. The seroquel was prescribed off label for insomnia due to the anxiety and appetite because I was so anxious and afraid I just couldn't eat and lost a drastic amount of weight. 

I leave hospital, and continue on with the seroquel. 150mg at night and 50mg in morning for racing thoughts. 

My weight begins to sky rocket, I'm exhuasted during the day, I have horrible restless legs at night, absolutely no sex drive. I can't get in to see general doctor for a month, and psychiatrist will take months as we have none where we live asides from the one on duty at the hospital. Outpatients are put on a wait list for a teleconference with a psychiatrist from the city.

So last night I begin to taper. I cut a quater of my 150mg at night and take the larger portion, I cut a quater of the 50mg this morning and take the larger portion. I begin to worry that the anti psychotic was keeping a psychotic episode at bay. Maybe I don't have OCD and will suffer a psychotic break. I worry about this all day. 

Anyway earlier tonight I go outside to have a smoke and notice some theives have taken my lighter and ash tray full of butts. Weird because only just last night I was discussing in a ladies only facebook group about things neighbours had done to annoy you, I had posted how last year some time my former neighbours were stealing my cigarette butts and lighters but it stopped when they went to juvenile detention. Now even weirder a little while later it pops up in my memories on facebook that it had been 1 year since the last lot of ash trays and lighters had begun being stolen. 

My mind goes into overdrive. They are only coincidences I know that, but what if this is the start of a psychotic break? What if I begin to believe it was a set up, or planned, or a premonition, or there are mind readers living near me. Now I do not believe a single one of these, but my OCD is saying what if I do. 

Is this how psychosis starts. Thank you for reading. I've been in tears all night thinking this is the beggining of a psychotic break.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Alcoholic Ex-Friend reaching out to me again. I had a friend I was very close with who was an alcoholic. Drinking at work, not coming home from the bar at night and crashing at a stranger's place, almost ending the relationship with the love of his life. He cut me off completely last fall and basically told me that I'm dead to him. His partner and I are good friends and she wasn't ""allowed"" to have drinks with me or stay overnight at my house anymore nor was I welcome in their home. Just recently he decided I was allowed in his girlfriend's car when he was in it too. Anyway, we started talking and it was like no time had passed at all.

&amp;#x200B;

He invited me over a few days later to hang out. I accepted only to fix something of mine with his help, not to hang out, and made that clear. I stayed for 2 hours. It was a lot of fun. He apologized to me for how he acted and told me he's in therapy now. He 100% doesn't drink anymore and hasn't for a month. I know my emotions are my responsibility, not his, so I just thanked him for the apology and went home. But the thing is, I was devastated when he cut me off like that, and as much as I want to be friends with him again, I don't think I can be. I'm posting this here because I wanted advice from others who struggle with alcoholism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this just part of recovery? Should I just maintain a polite but firm distance? I don't want to do anything that would - and I'm choosing my words very carefully here because I KNOW I'm not responsible for his feelings or his drinking - make it more likely for him to relapse. I don't think it's in my best interest to let him be my friend again and my SO is of the same opinion. In fact my SO, who also struggles with drinking, is of the opinion that I shouldn't speak to this ex-friend of mine until he apologizes. Which he has, but it was a half-assed ""btw, sorry I was so shitty to you"" as I was on my way out the door. It felt sincere but not good enough, considering how much he hurt me.

"Is this a symptom of schizophrenia? Hi y'all, I'm currently in high school and for the past year I've been noticing some odd things my brain has been doing, which I can't really seem to stop. The primary thing is I've been having conversations with myself in my own mind... kind of. I really enjoy talking to people in real life and I have a good group of friends, but when I'm alone I guess my brain doesn't want to stay alone, so I converse with other people I know in real life, but in my mind - as in, I will say something and another part of me will think of a response that they might say back. I never really believe it's real telepathy, or that the people I'm talking to would actually hear what I am thinking in real life (although sometimes it does come kind of close to reality if you know what I mean). At times, I will actually end up talking to myself (as in, my mouth starts moving and I start whispering). I've really noticed it the last month or two, and I've been trying to get myself to stop doing it, but it's pretty hard to completely when I'm alone and doing nothing. The people I talk to are mostly people I would like to get to know better in real life (as I'm writing this I realize I should probably get to know those people in real life to maybe try to prevent it). I've looked it up and it's not listed as a symptom of schizophrenia but I could see how it relates to some other symptoms. (Edit: I actually did find \[this\]([https://www.yourcareeverywhere.com/stay-up-to-date/blogs/2017/01/03/schizophrenia-symptoms--perceived-telepathy.html](https://www.yourcareeverywhere.com/stay-up-to-date/blogs/2017/01/03/schizophrenia-symptoms--perceived-telepathy.html)) but that's like the only thing I could find) That's the main weird thing I've noticed, I also have frequent anxiety about exams and my parents have noticed symptoms of depression, and I'm already going to therapy for that.

&amp;#x200B;

"Conflicted/Relapsing So, here I am. Again. It’s familiar. The same old dance to a different song. I was doing so well. I was weight restored. I had learned coping skills that actually stuck with me this time. I was getting healthy. I had started to get my friends back. 

Then one tiny little setback and here I am again. Obsessed. Counting. Starving. Depressed and anxious. I can’t reach out this time because it’s failure and I’m not ready to be a failure again.

"Overwhelmed with therapy suggestions for toddler Our 2.5 year old daughter was just diagnosed on the “moderate to severe” end of the spectrum. She does not not talk at all and is (hopefully) on the verge of walking independently. She also does not eat anything besides formula despite weekly OT feeding therapy over the past year.

The clinic that diagnosed her gave her the following recommendations:

-20-25 hours ABA therapy a week
-speech therapy 3x a week
-OT 2x a week
-PT 2x a week
-floortime therapy 1 or 2x a week

We currently get 2 in-home play therapy sessions a week (I have no idea if this qualifies as “floortime”) and until last week had 2 PT and 1 OT appointments a week. I am looking for somewhere closer to home to take her for speech/OT/PT now, and we are going through the process of getting in-home ABA therapy through our insurance.

I’d be interested to hear anyone else’s experience doing this much therapy with their toddler? It seems unreasonable to me, but maybe I have to change my mind on this? I already felt like the amount of therapy we’ve been doing is a lot, but she’s not talking, so I’m of course very concerned. I want to make sure I’m doing everything I can to support her - without going crazy.

"Emotional attachment to your instrument??? A couple weeks ago I couldn’t find my flute case anywhere in my dorm room and was really worried when I went to orchestra rehearsal. Told my professor and asked if I could borrow one, he said he didn’t at the moment and to go back to my dorm and take another look and to not worry if I couldn’t find it.

Still couldn’t find it, I have to go to the front desk of the music hall and sign to rent/borrow one of their flutes. I have an instrument to play but it feels all wrong (didn’t feel right in my hands).

I’d checked with multiple campus buildings and campus police and nobody had it and i only just found it last night at my dorm building’s lost and found and i was almost in tears.

I’ve had the same flute since middle school and it was with me all four years of marching band in high school so if I lost it forever it’d be devastating. My flute is almost like a little buddy for me.

"Success begets failure; why try? That's a pretty damn pessimistic title, I know.

Quite frankly I don't know why I'm even writing this. I think I've lost it at this point. After attempting suicide at the end of 10th grade (when I was 16) and leaving school because of daily migraines (probably stress related) and then spending multiple years doing nothing but suffering from intense pain I finally got a job centered around bettering myself and contributing to my community (when I was 17). I worked that job for a year and left on good terms (not without a few major hiccups). That brings us to this past year (2018/19).

Back in November (I was 18 [sorry for placing these probably obvious notes, it's just meant for clarity]) I decided to start lifting weights and did so until February. During this time period I certainly was not feeling my best, but was at least able to manage. In April a mentor convinced me to apply to a college program which I managed to successfully interview for and be admitted to (a really great school and I would pay a total of 3500 in only my first year). I began this month, in July, but a couple months ago my symptoms from PTSD and whatever else have intensified to extremes. There's so much information to get out but I don't know how to get it out. My body shuts down when I try. My trauma is from long term intense csa from multiple abusers (some short-term, some long-term), emotional abuse/gaslighting/psychological torture at home, and physical abuse at and away from home.

Anyway.. back to school. I started a couple weeks ago and am just completely lost. The work is easy for me but I can't do it. When I try to buckle down like I used to I start to dissociate and this has just never happened before. Most of the time when I try hard to concentrate.. SOMEHOW the words on the pages or whatever I'm trying to process just ceases to make any sense at all; because of this I am 2.5 weeks behind in a shortened semester that lasts 5 weeks. I have already completely forfeited my chance to get the scholarship (GPA based) at the end of the year through this screw-up and may even be forced to withdraw from the program.

"Adult ADHD and Medication, is it good ? I've had ADHD all my life but I managed to cope fine, I guess I was just lucky. It got me into a lot of trouble and causes some hell at school but I got through without a diagnosis. The Doctors  wanted to diagnose me as a kid but I probably also have oppositional defence disorder and refused because I was a cool kid or some bullshit.

I'm now 17 (My doctor said even though I'm not 18 it's an Adult ADHD diagnosis and will be treated as such) and my untreated and undiagnosed ADHD got very bad very quickly and has now ruined my college course, job, friendships but most of all my relationship with my girlfriend.

I basically became unfunctionable, everyone thought when I couldn't hear them I was choosing to ignore them, when I forgot something I didn't care about them, when  I was struggling to manage my emotions I was being silly, when I didn't shut up or said something impulsively I was being a cunt and so on and so forth.

So as things in my life kept getting worse I went to my GP (Like a family Doc for those of you in the US) and explained all my symptoms and that I thought it was ADHD at that point my memory was the worst bit it was unreal. I told him if it was ADHD I wanted to try everything but medication first and only medication as a last resort as I'm well aware of the side effects and he assured me this is standard protocol. But we agreed it was adhd, referred me to a specialist in ADHD who also agreed it's 99.99% ADHD and just wanted a follow up appointment with my mum to make sure she agrees with everything I said. However the specialist said they only offer medication and they only treat ADHD for children in my area so if I don't go on medication now i can never have it. 

Now right now I feel I need medication, I've got about a month's worth of college work I just can't get done, I try but nothing comes to mind, I get distracted, trying to take makes me feel like my head will pop so I just give up. After a huge fuck up my appointment is next Wednesday which seems a year away but hopefully it comes round quickly. I will hopefully get to start medication after that. However I'm not sure if I want to be on it long term or if I can learn to manage like before.

I know several of us have been struggling with people who have inadequate exposure to autism. Our way of thinking, and the life differences that entails can make it difficult for those people to understand our or our families' lives. I want to solve this problem, and my new subreddit is my attempt to help bridge that gap in understanding.

It's over at /r/talesfromautism. I figured that since a lot of our stories were stories of awkwardness (a characteristic which is a comedy staple) that our stories could fit into the mostly funny, sometimes intense through other emotions, style of other ""talesfrom[whatever]"" subreddits. My hope is to appeal to neurotypical people with those funny stories, while also making sure that we, the people affected by autism, are in control of the narrative, so our perspective comes across and people will understand better what it feels and looks like to be autistic.

I welcome posts by anybody autistic, whichever level you are, or anybody who has a personal connection with an autistic person to tell your story.

"When to take an XR med with an ever shifting schedule? So I was recently prescribed Adzenys, and from googling it looks like it kicks in within an hour, and can last up to 12 hours. 

Is this one of those medications where I should try to hit roughly the same dosing time every day? Or can I just take it say 10 hours before I shouldn't need it any more (giving myself a potential extra 2 hours for lee way.)

I'm asking because my shifts at work can vary day to day. One day I may be working from 1:00 pm to 8:00 pm, the next day 8:00 am to 4 pm, and then from 2:00 pm to 10:00 pm, and so on.

There's no way I could always hit all the times I would really *need* the medication, without changing the times when I take the medication. 

I'm sure a big part of determining this is just to wait and see how the medication effects me (I've only been on it two days so far) and adjust from there, but just looking for other's experiences.

"Elvanse/Vyvanse makes my procrastination much worse Hi, I have been on Elvanse (same as Vyvanse apparently) for almost 2 months now. I started on 30 mg and now I take 60 mg every morning. It makes me more focused and less tired, but for some reason it also makes my procrastination much worse, especially in the first few hours after it kicks in. I'm in university and on weekends and on days without lectures I sometimes stay in bed for a couple of hours just doing useless stuff on my phone, and when I use my computer to study and I look up one thing on the internet, I can easily get stuck wasting lots of time. This of course happened before I started taking medication but it's a lot worse now. And the days on which I have skipped taking a pill it's on my ""normal"" unmedicated levels again. 

It also feels different. I'm constantly aware that I'm wasting every second while I'm doing it, but I can't stop. It's like I'm hyperfocused on procrastinating or something. When I get the urge to open a new tab and go to reddit or YouTube or whatever, I somehow feel like I *have* to do this and it's really important, but once I'm done with it I can look back and see that I just wasted my time on useless stuff that wasn't even enjoyable really. It seems time goes by a lot faster too. It's a huge difference from my unmedicated procrastination, where I'm just unfocused and wander off for a while and then remember I should be doing something else and I can stop most of the time. This is all really weird to me. It's to the point where I wanna give up on meds because I'm actually more productive unmedicated despite the lower focus and feelings of motivation.

Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know how to combat this?",adhd,adhd
"Did I just have a fucking schizophrenic episode? Hey, im 14yo. I've tripped acid 5 times, smoked weed more than I could count, drank 2 times, juul in school, dph 2x, addys 3x, lsa 2x, xan 2x, etc. so I wouldn't be surprised. I have so much family history of nutcases, addicts, etc. but I thought that I was fine and that none of that would affect me because im retarded and think that im different - for some reason. Last night I took 225mg DPH, didn't hallucinate, had around 8 hours of sleep.   


At around 12pm I got really tired (as if I was awake all night and just laying down at 6-9am), which is really weird for me. Then I had these weird ""nightmares"" and i'm still so confused as to exactly what happened. I would be usually very VERY dizzy, almost like I was barred out on like a ton of Xanax. Then my parents would call me to do something while im unable to move straight and I would be so goddamn paranoid and anxious about it for some reason. A few times I had shit jumping at my face that would petrify me. The weirdest thing is I would always seem to be back in my bed and either ""wake up"" and walk somewhere or enter back into a ""nightmare"". There was one time that I finally thought it was over, was gonna go to my brothers room bc I wasn't dizzy anymore. In the hallway, I randomly tripped on my pc... MY FUCKING COMPUTER, IN THE HALLWAY! Well anyway, my parents ""woke up"" from the noise and I would go back to the same fucking process. There was once where all I can remember is my brother COMPLETELY RANDOMLY telling me that he always gets attacked. For some reason I instantly knew he mean't that thing that jumped at my face. I went into more fucking paranoia and shit. At the end I could feel my entire body, phone, and house shaking. It was very weird.  


I have never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses. I hardly have any emotion, let a lone anxiety and/or paranoia. This only lasted 1 hour IRL but it felt like at least 10-15 times that I went into this loop. After I felt very mentally drained and sorta like I do after an acid trip. This has scared me to either completely stop or ABSOLUTELY LIMIT every drug I can take that has ties with disorders (so probably none tbh). I only use them so often cause I escape boredom with it. When im sitting in my room, staring at my pc for hours, it gets pretty boring.

"Is my girlfriend/partner possibly showing early signs? So we've been together for nearly 7 years. There have been a few moments over the years where my partner would say she saw something or felt really scared home by herself, but I never thought much of it. After all nobody is perfectly rational 100% of the time. She also grew up in a large family and was more or less never alone as a child, so it made perfect sense to me that she never really learned to be comfortable alone.

However, I've recently been thinking over all the details and I realized that if I were to write it down, maybe it wouldn't sound quite as innocent as I've always assumed. I'm really not sure.

The first event was before we lived together. I was going over to her family's house early one morning on a weekend. When I got there, I found her in tears and incredibly agitated/scared. She said she'd seen a ""shadow person"", and seeing it sent her immediately into a huge panic. Her family had already comforted her a lot by the time I got there. Of course I looked up shadow people and saw that it can be a symptom of schizophrenia, but nothing was conclusive.

Years passed, and she moved in with me. One day she texted me at work asking me to come home quickly. Luckily I had already finished up work for the day and was ready to come home. When I got there, she was on the bed crying. She'd seen a shadow person again, and this time nobody was there to comfort her.

Years passed again. During these years, there were no shadow people sightings. However, she has since always been scared of being alone. If she's in the apartment alone, she'll always turn on all the lights and shut all the doors to every room. This is something that I always brushed aside as being only slightly odd/unusual. Like I said, she was never alone growing up, so I didn't think it was that weird that she was uncomfortable with it. 

However, one day I connected two details together that I hadn't before: every time she's seen a shadow person before, it's been in a door frame, vaguely in an adjacent room. I realized she closes doors because, if the pattern persists, she can't see a shadow person in a doorframe with the door closed.

Recently, with the time change and winter coming, it's started getting dark really early. Sometimes it's quite dark as early as 5:30 or 6 PM. Usually I'll get off work before her, but occasionally she gets back before me. A few weeks ago, she was texting me anxiously asking me when I'd be home. When I pulled in and parked, she was coincidentally walking out at the same time to check the mail. 

I didn't really think much of this until she sort of spilled some details throughout the rest of the evening. When she got home earlier, she got very scared in the apartment because of the darkness. She didn't even progress beyond the entryway, instead immediately going into the guest bathroom right next to the front door, where she stayed and texted me. She didn't even turn on the lights in the rest of the apartment -- just went straight into the bathroom (where of course she did turn on the light). Eventually she couldn't take it and decided to check the mail, and I happened to get home at the same time.

Individually, none of this is that bad. Put it together, though, and I notice a pattern of terror-inducing hallucinations (very, very rare -- many years pass between occurrences), paranoia about those hallucinations happening again (shutting doors if alone), and fear in general of being alone which is greatly magnified in the dark.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"I’m back from inpatient care... so this is how life can be? I was recently discharged from a psychiatric ward and came out of it with an Insomnia Disorder, GAD and also Schizoid Personality Disorder. I didn’t “come out of there” like that, I just found what I have been dealing with has a name. 

After having an alarming number of psychotic episodes in the span of three weeks (any number is alarming) I became very worried and went to a psychiatrist and therapist as soon as I could. We talked and discussed all sorts of things, but then I had a complete breakdown last weekend and had to admit myself once I snapped out of it. 

I realize now all of the paranoia and delusions were directly caused by my insomnia, but it was scary and life changing nonetheless. I also recently found this community and just wanted to say hi to everyone hope you are doing well. Thanks for listening to me talk about my week. Love you all

"Do /you/ have the skills needed for romance? So lately I've been thinking about the hard limits that having aspergers has placed on my functioning as a social animal.   

My limits are of course different to yours, and your limits are different to those of the next person on the spectrum, but I think we can safely make a few general statements about the people reading this post:  

***You'll never be the spontaneous, charming, hyper-social entertainer in your social circle... but you're capable of giving an entertaining speech if you practice.***   

*and*  

***You're not well suited to customer-facing roles... but you're capable of performing work which is meaningful (to you) and valuable (to your employer) if your needs are accommodated.***   

and so on. The idea is that we're autistic but we also have the capacity to adapt to the world of neurotypicals. As autistics we can't reach the highest levels of performance in the social realm but we can socially integrate with neurotypicals with enough skill to get that engineering job (or that IT role, or whatever) and let our true strengths shine.   

I wonder, though, if starting and maintaining a romantic relationship should be considered a high level social task; I wonder if most of us with high-functioning autism just don't have the inherent social ability required for this sort of relationship.   

I've been on speed dates and tried talking to women in public, and it just feels like these activities aren't meant for people with autism. Even normal people feel uncomfortable and have difficulty knowing what to say when they're speaking to a potential date.

Anyway, I noticed they will misspell words a lot . Instead of saying “of course” they say “of coarse”

The other day we were talking . They spelled wood as would lol.

A lot of the times they will also skip certain words in a sentence. Example 

“I want go outside” 

“I’m tired so have to go sleep”

"I have lost one half of FIVE different pairs of gloves this winter. Five. Pairs.

"LONG DAY, LONG VENT N: niece
M: mom
s: sister 
(Sorry bout this I just got tired of typing “my niece”, “my mom”, “my sister” without using names)

TRIGGER WARNING
deadass don’t know what all I typed but I know this probably needs a trigger warning 


So today my mom drove two hours to pick me up at my house (one working car between me and my husband right now) and two hours back to her house. I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn’t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn’t. 

I mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn’t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn’t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn’t until I said something that she stopped. I think it’s just because I’m an adult now and she knows she can’t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. 

Not even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I’m projecting. I don’t think so though. 

We were out to eat with S who I haven’t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn’t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. 

ANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I’ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I’m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she’s my sister and I love her. The entire time I’m saying all this she’s looking at me like I’m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay. Honestly I don’t even remember what she said. It’s fucking cliche but it’s literally all a blur. This always happens. Whatever she said is just not even a memory. Whenever I’m in conflict of any kind I can’t remember what was said. My body like shuts down. I can barely hear my own thoughts. My vision has blurred in and out before. Lately when I’m panicking I can’t hear anything. It’s scary. I don’t know if these are symptoms. I got diagnosed with PTSD and haven’t been back to the doctor since. It’s fucking terrifying. 

I remember what I said before I walked out of the restaurant. Something shitty about her creepy ass boyfriend? (I only feel this way about him because he tried to fuck me when I was 16 and he was 20. She knew this. Is now living with him) 

I just stood at the back of the restaurant and trembled. I called my husband and just balled and asked him to pick me up. Felt like 5 minutes had passed but it’d been 20.  My mom texted me my niece was upset so I went back in because I honestly hate that she even witnessed this disfunction.  

I don’t even know anymore. I just miss my family, but I hate them. I’ve had so many traumatic experiences in my life and almost all of them (including being molested) were caused by FAMILY. It fucks with me. I was raised to believe the most important people were family but at the same time they caused me the most pain. And continue to do so.",ptsd,ptsd
"I suffer from childhood PTSD, and I've been writing an english piece about Combat PTSD trying to use my own history as sort of source material. I just wanted to post the work here, maybe get some more insight so maybe I could help get it published for more awareness around PTSD. “Inside every person you know, there is a person you don’t know.”

It is 6am, and my alarm is going off. My wife wakes alongside me as our daily routine begins. She knows what I like to eat, she knows how I like my tea. She knows what clothes to iron for me. She knows what temperature to set the heating to, because she knows that I can’t stand the cold. She knows to make as little noise as possible, because I enjoy the calm. She knows that I have a two hour commute to work in the morning if I take the train, and that’s why I take the car. She knows that I love my work, and that my work fulfils me in a way family cannot. She knows that my work keeps me from her, and that perhaps that doesn’t upset me as much as it upsets her. She loves me,but she doesn’t know me.

She will never know me the way that I know her, because I have known her since I met her. I have known her since the first night we spent together back in our youth. She likes her coffee with milk and two sugars, and she likes her toast lightly burned and heavily buttered. She sleeps on the side of the bed closest to the door. She organises the cutlery drawer with precision, because she likes the order to be tablespoons, teaspoons, then forks and knives. She goes to the beauty parlour on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and then gets coffee with her girlfriends, and they gossip for hours, and then she picks up the children on her way home. She cooks at 6:30 for the children, and then starts to cook for us at 7:00 because I often won’t be home till 8:00. I do not often observe this, but I know this because I know her. She is beautiful, but she is shallow. I am happy to love her and be loved by her, but it was never hard for me to know her.

She does not know that I am so hard to know because there is much about myself that I am afraid to confront. She does not know that on the days that I leave as early as 4:00AM for work, it is not because I need to work but because I cannot sleep. She does not know of my racing heart, or the paralysing fear which overwhelms me during my sleep and haunts me while I am awake. She does not know of the things I have seen, when I fought and bled overseas for days upon days in the chaos of battle surrounded by seas of broken minds, broken bodies and broken men. She does not know that I hate the cold, because of the freezing days I spent living like a rat in a foxhole, praying that I would not succumb to the icy winds and freezing rain that I could feel sinking into my bones and ripping at my skin like the inevitable grip of Death itself. She does not know that the reason I enjoy the quiet is because I can constantly hear gunfire and artillery, the thundering orchestra of war. The drums of battle did not come from the marching band, but instead the percussive doom that spelled the end of many of my friends. She does not know that the overtime I “spend in the office” is actually spent drinking away the memories I am not ready to process, reliving seeing my friends turned into bloody messes of bones, blood and meat. Many nights I drive home drunker than I ought to be, perhaps subconsciously hoping that an accident on the road will answer the calamity within my head.

She doesn’t know me, but it is not because I do not care for her or love her. It is because I do not know if I truly know myself. Often I try to reconcile the bright young man I once was with the man that I am now, but that young man is unrecognisable to me now. He was a man with no blood on his hands. He had never taken a life or seen a life taken. War changed me, and home is no longer home to me. I do not feel unwelcome in my home, but it feels as though my tainted soul corrupts the innocence of my children, and has extinguished the bright flame that once burned in the heart shared between my lover and I.

If I pat my son’s back, will I soil his youthful skin with the blood I cannot wash from my hands? When I hold my daughter’s hand as we cross the road, does she know that those same hands that hold hers once were gripped around the throat of a man fighting for the same reasons I was? When I look into my wife’s eyes, does she see the eyes of her husband or of a murderer?

"Hypnosis therapy was effective Has anyone here tried hypnosis to assist with recovering from trauma? I did when I was 18 (currently 21) and barely remember even going to the sessions but have improved tremendously because of the sessions. I was repeatedly sexually abused as a child by a family member. My boyfriend at the times aunt ran a hypnosis therapy clinic in Chicago. She offered a few free sessions with a great hypnotist there which was extremely kind of her because there was no way I could afford that at the time. I wanted to forget every memory of being molested and abused and pretty much trick myself into having no memory of it so I did not have to actually recover from the trauma because this family member is someone I see frequently. My family is super Muslim so bringing up something like this in the open wouldn’t be appropriate and I would be somehow blamed for it even though I was around 4 years old when it started. Even just bringing up a very small part of my trauma once to my mom when I was 15 years old resulted in her saying that “we don’t talk about these things”. Police involvement, etc isn’t an option or something that I wish to pursue. 

After the first session, I was already starting to disassociate with the memories. By the 5-6 session I was completely forgetting and could make myself believe that it was a memory someone told me about but never actually happened to me. I started to even forget I sought out hypnosis a few months after. I have not even thought about this since but recently had a dream about the same hypnosis clinic. I make daily entries in an online journal so I was able to go back to entries made 3 years ago and read my daily experience and pretty much watch my progression with disassociating the memories.

"family member with stage 4 cirrhosis relapsing... what to do? A family member in her late 40s just got out of their her first stint in rehab (90 days) and came out to living alone for the first time in her life in a apartment and it appears she is drinking again... lying about it to everyone after 14 days out of rehab.  She actually went to an AA meeting two days ago and was asked to take a breathalyzer because they suspected her of drinking.  She declined very angrily and left, not to return.  We found out about it and now no one knows how to handle getting her back into rehab.  

She says she's not drinking and that everyone riding her will drive her to drink...  I wasn't helping with the last placement in rehab but I was around for the holidays this year during this relapse and have since done a lot of research regarding rehab programs.  I have come to realize that that the aftercare part of her first release was nonexistent.  I called a different and more comprehensive rehab program (as compared to her last rehab) that utilizes a sober house w/ outpatient intensive for months following a patient's release.  My research leads me to believe that for someone in her situation to have a chance of success this part of the equation must be part of her aftercare plan.  Am I misreading this?   I understand that interventions are controversial, but she has stage 4 cirrhosis and is on the transplant list... a relapse appears to be potentially deadly, and quickly.  Is my medical research about this accurate?

She is livid at all of us for doubting her veracity about relapse, but she keeps lying about things... a hallmark of her drinking behavior in the past, and she recently smelled of alcohol or mouthwash (?).  My family is out of their depth, as am I, and we could definitely use some advice regarding the use of a professional intervention specialist.  Also, her children (teens) are not living with her and will not be involved in an intervention... and she is separated from her spouse.  What should we do?  The professional intervention specialist is ready to go but everyone is confused about the best plan of action.  She claims her therapist says she should not return to rehab and there is a theoretical planned phone call between her therapist and my family today.  She set it up, so let's see.  Her therapist predates her stint in substance abuse and my family doesn't know him.  But he does exist because I spoke with him briefly once before.  I'm really confused on how to proceed.  Help?

The surgeon  wanted me to go under General and get it sorted but I was too scared and so let it heal naturally which took 3 weeks on NG tube which made me sick. I have bad veins also and was stabbed numerous times every day by people trying to find veins for canulars or to take bloods. 2 doctors gave me a nose bleed because they were trying to very forcefully shove a large NG tube that was the wrong size up my nose. My dietician  restricted my water and I had severe dehydration headaches all weekend while she was off and no one would up my water intake because her word is law or whatever.

"Why is evaluation so expensive? I'm currently looking in to get evaluated for an autism diagnosis, and I'm blown away by the prices. 2 to 4 thousand dollars for a single evaluation. These prices are ridiculous, and they don't accept insurance, either. I simply cannot afford this. Does anyone know any cheaper organizations that offer a professional diagnosis? I live in the USA.

"PTSD has made me feel like someone is going to murder me. Please help! For the last 2 years I (21F) have suffered PTSD from an incident in college where an athlete beat me in a stairwell when I was walking home from my friends dorm late at night. This has severely impacted my life, as you would expect. I’ve been through therapy, tried all the coping mechanisms to relieve the pain I felt after that incident. However, one thing I cannot get over is my fear of something happening like this, but in my sleep.
I’m not sure if i sound crazy, but I live in an apartment in a new college town (transferred universities because I couldn’t be in that environment, and also switched my major). My unit holds 3 people but the other 2 have moved out. Til August 1st, I am here alone, and every night i go through the same thing. Im scared to be home alone for many reasons.
Typically I am fine when the sun is out, but as soon as the sun goes down, my anxiety peaks. All of the sudden I start hearing noises and I am scared someone is in my unit. It’s not just a quick scare, like I full blown think someone is in my apartment. I have literally locked myself in my room, called cops, and made them come check out my apartment. It’s always been clear. For some reason I cannot move past this. I cannot fall asleep because I am scared someone is going to attack me while I am asleep and my pain will start over again. 
I need help with this. I am patiently waiting for my roommates come back, but it seems like a light year away. Literally, as I am writing this, I hear noises and I am freaking out. 
I think i am going insane. Sometimes I talk myself into thinking the most obscure things like “there is a murderer under my bed” or things like that. But in the morning, I always look back on it and tell myself i’m so stupid for thinking someone was in here. 
I feel like I have tried everything to ensure my safety. My dad has come up to put 2 extra locks on my door. Yes, two EXTRA! 
I am hoping someone could give me some words of wisdom or advice because this is simply ruining me internally and physically. I don’t know if medication is something I should seek out.",ptsd,ptsd

"Thank you TLDR Thanks for all who are supportive of people on the spectrum, it means so very much. 

A few weeks ago, I had a heart to heart with one of my bosses. I'm on the spectrum, and some of the people I was working with had just been butting heads. Things were unclear, and they don't do conflict conversations very well.  

It caused problems, the job was ending. But I didn't tell them I was on the spectrum because there were some slanderous things said by team members. Half joking, off-collar, the kind of stuff we hate. It didn't need to be really bad &lt;fill in your own example&gt; for it to be an unsafe, unwelcome and unwanted environment. Just happened that fast. 

But then they started talking about trying to hire people on the spectrum, not knowing that here I was, with the condition they thought would be helpful. It's a software shop, so it makes sense. But then I had to tell them that no, you shouldn't actually do that. Because I'm autistic, and you guys are terrible to work with for someone on the spectrum and here's why. (mostly communication). 

And most people still think autism has to do with lacking empathy, or an ability to connect with others (seems I have the opposite problem, if so.) 

And my boss then tells me that his child has autism. And in that brief moment, I went from feeling alone to feeling understood. 

Many close friends of mine don't know because I didn't find out till later in life and it never came up. They just say ""That's Fred, being Fred."" or as my Mom used to say ""I have a Frank!"" 

All that to say, for those that work or live with those on the spectrum - thank you. Being around people who know that my flaws are a condition, rather than character, and who can understand that are so energy giving. And very, very, rare. ",autism,autism
"How do you manage your time? And stop accidentally doing nothing for hours without noticing? I’m a college student and though I’ve gotten MUCH better than I used to be, I still often underestimate the time I need to do work or I just accidentally spend hours sitting there on youtube or instagram or whatever, especially before bed. I just found out I got a research positioning AND a tutoring job yesterday, so if I keep managing my time this badly, I’m screwed.

"Drinking Boyfriend So I have been dating this guy for over 2 years. I love him to the moon and stars and to everything else in between. When we first started dating I didn’t realize he had an issue with drinking. It slowly came out. Or maybe I was just naive. I’ve never been around anyone with drinking or drug issues and it’s not in my family or friend circle. Sure my friends drink or my family members have social drinks - but I mean daily drinking.  After about 6 months of heaven, things slowly starting changing. The drinking starting shining brighter. And regardless of that, I have been here for this man. For everything. Because I love him.  I have been beating myself up a lot lately because I think issues are me but my friend, who is basically my therapist, insists it’s because of his drinking. He isn’t very vocal with emotions.  At all. Intimacy is rare - by that I mean being close, holding hands, giving kisses. Sex is great!! When we have it. I have a very high sex drive and he appears to not have such a high sex drive which is why I am writing this. I have taken this issue on as my own and am seeking advice.  We see each other on the weekends. I work. He works. It’s always worked for us. We plan on moving in together when we are financially able and as of right now with circumstances that aren’t related , we can’t. Anyways - we can have sex anywhere from 1-3 times a week. Which yes I know is great but that’s not the issue. We only have sex when he wants. If I try to start sex it’s a solid no. Firmly so that I just stopped trying. There is 0 foreplay. Like zero. Unless he wants a blowjob then he gets it. But I’ve been gone down on like 3 times in the past year and a half and that’s because I asked for it. He seems to have a real issue with orgasms and seems to concentrate really hard sometimes to do so (mostly after drinking for awhile). Sometimes he can’t keep an erection.  I’ve taken these problems as an issue with me. I’m not doing something right. I’m not giving him what he wants. It’s my body. It’s me not talking dirty. It’s me not being hot enough. The list goes on (me having anxiety doesn’t help this issue at all) so my question is - is this normal for someone who drinks the way he does ? Is it me ? Is it him ? Is anyone else experiencing anything at all similar ? 

His drinking includes -
During the week just beer. Monday through Thursday. He buys a big case of beer on Sundays. I am not sure how many beers he drinks a day. 

Friday through Sunday he drinks a half pint of liquor  with pop followed sometimes by a couple shots and some schnapps. And beer. Like a beer every 30 minutes. He usually starts drinking around 5 (not sure why he has this time limitation) 

When we are on vacation he drinks a fifth a day. This is usually a week or two in the summer and then during Christmas. 

Again, I have anxiety and I think our sex issues are me.  I have this picture in my head he wants some hot ass woman that I’m not and I’m not giving him what he needs sexually. I know it might sound crazy.  I have tried talking to him about this and he assured me it’s not me. He says I do everything great and if he had a problem he would tell me. Everything else in our relationship is wonderful. He spend all of our free time together and have a wonderful time. I’m not trying to make this just about sex. I’m just seeking peace of mind for myself with anyone who has similar experience or may know what it’s like for him. Thanks so much.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Theory about psychosis Hi guys- This is pretty freaking long so bear with me lol. I don’t actually “have” (what does that even mean) psychosis or was diagnosed but I’ve struggled with mental health and felt “crazy” all my life and it has all been this giant confusing question mark. I also was in love with someone who had psychosis, and I feel like I understand on a spiritual level. I identify a lot with spirituality but a lot of the time it feels like an unfulfilled fantasy. I also feel like it is part of my life purpose to understand this and try to spread some truth about “mental illness”. I hope nobody is offended by this but it’s just my thoughts about the topic. If you disagree or have some thoughts about what I’m saying or find it unhelpful please let me know, even if if it’s flat out disagreement.

You’re not crazy and there’s nothing wrong with you. Mental health professionals are not out to get you, or lying, but more so just brainwashed themselves. I think the way society handles mental illness is completely and totally wrong and the professionals go to school, that’s what they learn, and that’s what they think is right. How can the brain have “switches” that flip on “PTDS” or “schizophrenia”. That just doesn’t make sense. The brain is a spectrum and more like an ever changing fractal design. But alas, that is way harder to treat, so the mental health system puts things in boxes so it’s easier to understand. I’m not saying don’t trust any of them, because I genuinely don’t think they’re out to get you. 

Your delusions are not “wrong” they’re based in a soul with strong intuition that got “confused” or “dirty” like a photo was was originally super clear but got water damage or something. Know that the core of strength is there but you have to clear the fog so that the confusion is lifted. If darkness is proportional to light, you have a big big light. 

Mental “illness” is nothing but unhealed pain. 
If pain is and can be directly proportionate to love, growth, awareness, and understanding. Ever notice a trend in people with “psychosis” of feeling like you’re a healing, extrasensory, meant to do great things, feel colors, creative (originally but probably not in the height of an episode) sounds, have these associations in the brain, etc. I don’t think that’s wrong at all. I think that people with mental illness are typically people with psychic and intuitive gifts that sort of...”went wrong”, or more so, we’re not integrated healthily or disowned by family. From a spiritual perspective, I think sometimes psychosis or schizo can occur out of unfulfilled dreams of self and the division between “higher” spiritual self (which is very strong) and physical earth self. That division causes a sort of confusion and disconnect from psychical reality. 
Also, pain, addictions, trauma, etc I think are in our lives so we can heal from them and then become healers ourselves in a spiritual sense. If you don’t heal the trauma you continuously get holes and tears in your auric field and you’re no longer “protected” from outside negative influences. 


Our “mental illnesses” are the direct representation of the opposite of what we crave, because our world works in duality. When the universe wants you to heal an aspect of yourself, it will manifest as the complete opposite to bring awareness to that. So like, if your demons are telling you you’re alone and worthless, friendless, your core wound is probably feeling isolated and unwanted. The only way to heal this is to make friends with the demon. What you don’t fear anymore can’t hurt you. If you work to meet those needs and help the demon, voice, whatever you want to call it  find a place to meet that need, they can’t hurt you anymore. You’re not crazy. You’re not just some hallucinating psycho. What if everything that feels so negative, haunting, and scary, is actually trying to help you? Whatever you’re pain is directed towards, that’s probably the piece of your soul that needs to heal. 
You are talented, and gifted, and special. Your “delusions of grandeur” I think only come up because of, like how I mentioned, the unfulfilled talent. I genuinely do think people with psychosis have special intuitive abilities but they were never incorporated in a healthy way and sort of “stayed in the darkness”. So, when we feel that, but everything else in our life is telling us we’re a worthless piece of shit who can’t hold a job, the brain goes to opposite extremes to compensate. 

Sometimes this life feels like some sort of sick joke, or trial run. So confusing. All I want it to understand the nature of reality. Just laugh at the ridiculousness of it. How much these small minushas (how the fuq do you spell that) don’t really matter. 
I just want to say, you are a beautiful soul. There is nothing wrong with you. Your pain is a result of Unhealed pain. You don’t have to decide to try to heal it, you don’t have to do it all at once, you don’t have to do anything. You can respect it and know, you may not know exactly what it is, but maybe if you inquire you can’t find out. What do the voices want from you? What are they trying to get? What if they had the same pain as you, and just need to be directed to a different source of energy. Nothing in the world is bad. Just hurt. 

I do think mental illness is spiritual and not just a “malfunction” in the brain. The biggest healing i have felt is when I looked at what those demons were trying to tell me. My pain has always been about loneliness and not being accepted for who I am and being different. When I shared myself with people that get it that hole in my heart sorta kinda closed a little. 

As for getting help from mental health professionals, I have a hard time trusting them, because like i said, I feel like most are brainwashed (not evil I think they genuinely believe in what they’re saying). I think the most one can do is listen to your intuition. Stick with things and people that feel healing and genuine. Sometimes I’ve found the most healing from friends or other people (sometimes in the psych ward) then mental health professionals. ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"At a crossroad - need fellow ADHDers input I'm sorry this is long, just need some help and input.


I'm 32, live in USA, and suffered with ADHD my entire life. After over 10 years of changing doctors,being misdiagnosed, and taking wrong meds I finally found a good doctor/therapist and have been on proper medication(Adderall XR) for the last two months.
 

In the last two months my entire life has changed drastically. I stopped feeling shitty about myself and my life. I'm no longer depressed, started exercising daily, reading, thinking a lot of my past mistakes and how to improve, etc. Biggest one is that I moved out my parents house and have been living on my own(was paying ""rent $400 to cover bills"") .



The last ten years have been hell and I fucked up a lot. Failed out of college(have 50 completed hours), was going for computing. Let countless opportunities pass and felt like absolute crap every day. Completely hopeless.


I have reached the ceiling at my current job that I have been at for over 8 years. I will not be getting promotions or pay raises and my pay WILL remain about the same for eternity. It's a shitty job with $27,000 yearly. I have managed since I'm single and no kids but I don't want to stay here forever.


I have the following options:


Going back to school will be tough since I will be on probation for a semester and be limited to 9 hours(and pay a lot of stuff out of pocket)- this will be for fall which is ~10 months away. With the current job I could attend classes/or online and still get a small paycheck. Take out loans for classes. It is a ""safe"" option in my mind.


Second option I have is to go into Sprinter Van Expediting. I have been doing a lot of research and talking with people that do it and you can make really good money, still work 8-10 hrs a day, and still have time for online courses. Since I kept my credit in good standing I can get a loan for a Sprinter Van easily. Since school does not start for 10 months I have enough time to gain experience and set a schedule. Online courses can be done anywhere and this job is very flexible on time. I was thinking I can do 1-2 years online, save up every penny possible, and then transfer to day time classes or perhaps get the degree online. I will own the Sprinter van so I will still be able to work holidays/weekends/breaks. Would not need loans with this route. This is a ""high risk"", high effort, but higher rewards option. If it does not work out, I can sell the equipment, recoup most of the finances, and do the first option discussed about(local hourly job).


Due to my age I am limited in options. Too old for military, too old to be anything that takes 8+ years of education, too old for many things. I am thinking of choosing online computing related programs - I.T., Software Development, Computer Networking, etc. It does not pay AMAZING but it will be enough to sustain a family. As it is right now, I will go insane if I stay like this. Working a dead end job making crap pay, always worried about bills, never doing fun things because no money. 

But I also understand that I may be in a ""dream world"" so I need some feedback. I don't have anyone in person that I can discuss this with. What is the best course of action? What would you do? ",adhd,adhd

"PTSD and ED I have been doing so well at eating; I was eating enough to take care of myself and be healthy, but I was still losing weight (in a sustainable way). It was crazy and I was pretty proud. 

I have PTSD. Last night, I was triggered really badly. No one was able to come help me or be with me (literally everyone was busy), and my thoughts were so dark. I was seriously in a place where I thought I should kill myself. I have a medical marijuana prescription for acute triggers like this, and I smoked, which changed everything. I calmed down, I stopped crying, I was no longer suicidal, and I had no more plans to hurt myself. I didn't have another flashback or outburst of rage that night. But, I binged. 

I know that one night of binging is better than suicide, self harm, getting wasted, or any other of my many maladaptive coping skills. I am still uncomfortably full over 12 hours later.

While it's hard to gauge his drinking, I know that he goes through at least a gallon of vodka a week while at home. He drinks all day on the weekends. He recently had a seizure at work. He fell and broke his shoulder from the fall which required surgery. The neurologist said that his alcohol intake isn't sustainable and it will kill him. Apparently a seizure, surgery, and the stern warning from the doctor wasn't enough to scare him straight and he has only increased the amount of alcohol intake. My family is terribly worried and concerned for his health but we don't know what to do. Anytime it is brought up he says that ""I like who I am and I'm not changing."" 

My mother has been going to al-anon meetings and talking to family members and the consensus is that it might be time for an intervention. My stepfathers sister and brother in law (who is a recovering alcoholic) have agreed to come. Friends of my stepfather have also agreed to come. I have been reading about the effectiveness of interventions and the outlook seems poor. It seems like my mother is at a loss. As her son I feel so incredibly helpless and guilty that I can't help her or tell her what to do. My mother is planning to give him an ultimatum that if he doesn't seek help she will leave. She is financially dependent on him unfortunately and I am terrified of what she is going to do if they get divorced because she has no way of supporting herself. I obviously don't want her to stay in the relationship if it is at the expense of her sanity, but I have no idea what she will do financially.   


Is it time for an intervention? Are there other steps we should take first?

"Does anyone follow any particular diets, take any supplements, or use other non-traditional treatments? In addition to medication and therapy, obviously, not as a replacement.

I used to follow a MIND diet (basically a lot of kale, fish, berries, and nuts, and minimal desserts and red meats) and take around half a dozen supplements. I honestly think it helped a lot--when I stopped taking them and stopped following that diet as closely, my functioning dropped significantly.

"Effectiveness of ritalin for ADHD as an adult? I would like to use adderall but sadly it's not available in my country.

"How did it start for you? Hi, I'm a little bit worried that I am developing schizophrenia or another serious mental illness. I've known that I've had Bipolar disorder and PTSD. My therapist suggested that I might have Schizoid personality disorder. I think I have maladaptive daydream disorder, where I have extremely vivid and elaborate daydreams that last multiple days or weeks. when I'm experiencing these, I start talking to myself, making facial expressions and hand movements, etc., but I know they're not real, they just feel more real than reality. I have had auditory, visual and tactile hallucinations. I've had auditory hallucinations at night, and when they increased my seroquel dose, they pretty much went away. Only experienced visual hallucinations after smoking weed (I don't do that anymore), and tactile hallucinations happen from time to time.

"How do you get out of a housework slump? How do I get my shit together at home? Housework has always been the thing that I am by far the worst at. I basically don't do anything at home.

I am lucky enough to have a husband who likes tidying, but even so my apartment is a disaster zone more often  than not.

I know the specifics of how to actually tidy things properly and in particular I have a lot of plans to throw away/donate a lot of stuff. The idea being that owning less stuff will lead to there being less stuff to make a mess with.

We've tried using a points system to compete with each other (childish I know), also I've made cleaning schedules and simar thousands of times and never followed through with any of it.

Some things definitely work against me:

- I work only night shifts which means I'm changing my sleeping rhythm every few days which leads to me being completely unable to form routines or habits.

- I have been working way, way too much lately which has left me with no energy to get anything done.

- I think the biggest thing is that I don't really enjoy being in my apartment even when  it's pristine. I'm always feeling restless when I'm at home. None of the activities I could do at home for fun entice me. Which makes me feel generally unmotivated to tidy up, since I don't get any satisfaction out of the place being nice.

Okay, so I know what housework needs to be done and how to do that housework, but every time I have a day off I cannot bring myself to even do the tiniest thing. Instead I just lie in bed and sleep all day if I don't have anything planned in with friends. Basically all my time off the last three months has been wasted by me just sleeping all day.

How do I get out of this rut? I really want to get this thing of sorting through my stuff done because I'm moving in a few months and dont want to transport unnecessary shit. But every time I think, ""well today I could get started"", my brain just shuts down and I go to bed instead.",adhd,adhd
"What should I tell my visiting alcoholic dad after my baby is born? Hello Reddit,

I don't really know what to do about my current situation and thought I'd write to you all to see what kind of advice I can get. My dad is an alcoholic and about a year-and-a-half ago he almost died falling because he was drunk. He lost his memory for about a month and was the most stubborn and cruel person during that time. Much of that time he was in the hospital and only remembers hallucinations like the room being full of fire and dogs trying to attack him. Once he was sober and the effects of not drinking and hallucinations stopped, he made the decision to stop drinking. Unfortunately, his wife is an enabler and now he drinks about one to three beers a day. At least this is what he tells me. We currently live on opposite coasts so I only really know what he just tells me. 

I'm due for my second child in one month and they (my dad and his wife) are coming to visit for one week about one and a half weeks after my due date. I remember after my first child that I was very emotional for the first few weeks but felt normal again after my hormones balanced out. I'm really nervous that his drinking will cause a lot of anxiety that I don't really want to deal with. I think that I just need to be honest with him and tell him that I don't want him drinking in my house but I also feel like I shouldn't tell him what to do. Maybe if he really feels the need to drink he should just stay at a hotel and do that on his own time. 

Am I giving him too much credit? Do I need to be more stern? Even if I am stern I feel like it won't get me anywhere because he is stubborn. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Taking ADHD meds (Vyvanse) during an Interview? Hello all,

I've been prescribed to Vyvanse for a couple years. I recently started taking it pretty consistently (almost every day) since May 2017. I'm usually pretty good with public speaking, but I noticed that during August, when I had a conference presentation, I got super nervous and irritated right before the presentation. It was to the point where I literally did not even present -- this has never happened to me before. 

I now have a pretty big medical school interview coming up, so I stopped taking Vyvanse (40mg) in advance as I was quite shook from the past nervous breakdown I had in August. After a week off of Vyvanse, I felt horrible - and now I am back on it, and I feel absolutely great. I noticed that on Vyvanse, I am a lot more confident and feel like my communication skills are at their best. 

Question: Given the predicted adrenaline rush I would naturally feel from interview day, should I avoid taking Vyvanse on interview day? Or maybe I can take a small dosage? What do you folks think is best here? The interview is a week away.

"Self aware Is it possible for a person to be self aware of schizophrenia, I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor but I believe I could have it

&amp;#x200B;

My story starts off basic for about a year and half I would get on the bus to go to college but find it difficult to look people in the eye and continue eye contact I later could not stop doing this and on one to one interviews with teachers or getting jobs I could not keep eye contact

&amp;#x200B;

I later then started to drink with my friends socials and we would go out and drink but apparently I only remember this once as my friends told me in the morning I would say things such as the FBI are following us or they are plotting against us and then a few times I ran into some bushes 

&amp;#x200B;

later my life went more and more downhill and at night I started hearing a voice at first it was positive it was hard to distinguish if I was controlling what it was saying or if it had a mind of its own

Then as life got worse it started saying negative stuff and my inner monologue voice would start ageing with it but then it started to tell me no one cares , what do you have to live for that sort of thing and then I got image flashes of myself burning a lighter against my arm and then started thinking of self harm the weird part is I wanted to listen and do what the voice told me 

&amp;#x200B;

this voice is usually a voice from a villain from a TV show but sometimes it does this weird cycle where it would say a sentence but change voice throughout speaking the sentence it would start villain, my own voice, my friend voice and so on

&amp;#x200B;

I also started to lose interest in playing games on my PC or if I did 10 minutes or so later I would quit and just sit doing nothing then load it up again and quit

&amp;#x200B;

A few month ago my friend was telling a sad story about how a family member use to visit and always like his dog but no longer they get the same enthusiasm when visiting and I smirk and smiled at that and they noticed probably wanted to punch me but I did my best to cover it up but he knew, more and more if anyone tells a sad story I start to smile/smirk and get this weird good  sensation I know its wrong but I don't feel bad 

&amp;#x200B;

I also started watching the same TV shows over and over again I don't know if this has any relevance but the four TV shows I watched I just constantly get watching them from season one to the latest season such as doctor who or family guy

Basically a Jewish man killed they're lord and savior Jesus but Hitler wanted revenge so he wanted to destroy a religion his way of doing it was barbaric but who would want to believe in it if they knew the potential out come 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I also started thinking my family were talking about me and got paranoid and all the time they were down stairs and I was walking up the stairs I would stand or sit for a few seconds to make sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly feel evil and don't know what to do but someone told me (I never told them everything) it sounds like schizophrenia and then I looked it up and it linked but  don't really know if y o can have it and self aware you know you have it as different forum and answers say different things

"I don't know what's wrong with me guys. so I've never sought help for this because 1. I'm persistently terrified of doctors and 2. these ""cycles"" never seem to amount to anything really ""big"". but they still worry me never the less.

over the last year or so I've noticed a definite trend:

3-10 days: everything is so hard. so so so tired. no attention span. no motivation whatsoever. have to plan to reward myself with little things to even make it through my morning routine to get to work. will smoke like 1.5 packs of cigarettes and drink up to 3 energy drinks a day to try to keep myself going. have to repeatedly remind myself that I do in fact HAVE to do certain things to make it through the day. have sometimes called in sick to work because I just did not have the willpower to do absolutely anything. I feel mentally blank, stupid, and honestly damn near totally emotionless.

1-5 days: woah I almost feel like I used to. actually have some level of energy and motivation. life isn't a total shit hole, cool. little things are fun again. forcing myself to do things isn't too hard. my thoughts are actually more complex and coherent, I can feel emotions again.

3-5 days: ok too much. sounds are too loud. lights are too bright. what was motivation, alertness and interest in life is now irritability and frustration. like something in the back of my mind is telling me to be on high alert.

2-4 days: thoughts are super disjointed. I'll try to remember where I put my keys and upon attempting to recall a visual memory, am only able to mentally envision images of a bicycle I saw last week or the toaster oven my family had when I was little, random shit that just does not pertain to what im trying to think about. putting thoughts into words is difficult and frustrating. everything is startling. everything feels either brand new - like it's the first time I'm seeing the house I've been living in for over a year; or like I've lived through the exact situation I'm currently experiencing before - like this persisting feeling of deja vu but...dark. everything has a warped feeling of dread accompanying it. a friend will ask how work was for me that day and my thoughts are like ""what does he mean by that why is he trying to gather information? what sinister plans does he have with this information?"" - overly paranoid shit like that. I'm not even sure if they're hallucinations or not - but little shadows and sounds will put the fear of God in me. not sure if they're not real at all, or real and I'm just overreacting to them. and always, always, during these days - a weird throbbing, pressure headache behind my left eye and on the left side of my forehead.

and, not always, but every 4-7 of these cycles or so: 

1-2 days: supreme paranoia. what I later recognize are hallucinations. a buzzy beeping in my head, unintelligible voices, weird pulsing pains in my head. a reoccurring complex belief that someone has implanted me with a chip to track me, has replaced my loved ones with clones, that I've been hooked up to a machine and am living in a simulation where someone is trying to get information out of me by having me interact with simulations of loved ones. that someone is controlling my thoughts or basically hacking my thoughts.  I cannot go to work and will call in sick. went to work once while feeling like this and hid in the bathroom for 2 hours because someone in the building was monitoring my thoughts and the chip in my head was malfunctioning causing a headache. I've had times I'm extremely tempted and urged to cut at my neck because the buzzing and clicking sounds I attribute to a malfunctioning chip seem to originate from one point in my neck.

but I never totally noticeably go off the rails completely. I'll only lose total insight into the belief that these are delusions for longer than 3 hours at a time. I don't totally slip into full psychosis - at least not as deeply as some cases I've seen. and usually, the cycle begins to repeat before any major paranoia or hallucinations become prominent.

so I wonder wtf exactly may be wrong with me at this point. when I feel better, I call myself silly for overreacting and getting as crazy as I did a couple weeks before....but then it happens again. I'm terrified of doctors and have this persistent belief that if I tell anyone what's actually going on in my head, terrible things will happen. so there goes that idea.

wtf guys. most days I feel this can't be a real issue because it never gets really, *super* bad. but when it does get, well, moderately bad...it feels like a real issue to me, at least at the time. ugh.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"Please weigh in on my unmedicated friend's condition A good friend I've had for many years has schizophrenia. Early on she would be depressed, hurt herself, etc. She went to a doctor about 5 years ago when she was around 15, but they said she was too young to be prescribed?

 Anyway, I've helped her stop cutting and check in on her every now and then. Nowadays she seems completely happy and healthy, with a little crafting business where she sculpts the hallucinations she has into things like earrings and trinkets, along with paintings of these like, benevolent beings she sees on occasion. Her art isn't disturbing or red-flaggy at all, just a but off-kilter, and fairy-like. I believe channeling her psychosis into her art has helped a ton. She seems to be coping with her condition very well and is tremendously kind and caring- one of the best humans I've ever met.

However, I recently saw a YouTube documentary about an unmedicated man suffering from severe schizophrenia, things like communicating with god, believing the CIA was after him, in and out of police stations and mental hospitals, stuff like that. I watched someone who was already pretty wacked out degrade even further until finally it ended with him living on the streets and being hit by a train- an apparent suicide.

I never want this to happen to my friend, ever. The thought of this absolute flower of a human being even possibly ending up like that shatters my heart to think about. I brought it up to her and asked her if she took anything for what she had, but she thanked me and assured me she was fine the way she was and didn't need any medication, that her depression had tapered off and she learned to live with her psychosis- even showed me some nice art she made based off a person she had hallucinated. Given all I know about her, she seems... fine. I want to believe her, and I guess I do. She looks fine, she has a good relationship, a side business, she's never violent or has outbursts of depression or anxiety, all of this of her own accord, unmedicated.

I know this was very long winded and I probably sound foolish with how I've interpreted a lot of this, but I suppose I only want to know one thing.

**Can schizophrenia be left untreated? Or will her condition gradually get worse as she gets older, independent of her coping mechanisms, no matter how fine she seems right now?**

I've of course left her alone about it. But I'm fucking tearing up, and I'm scared. If there's a chance things can go downhill for her, just let me know.

"Looking for some insight on rectal digging and ways to reduce behavior. Hey folks, sorry for the sensitive material, but as I'm sure many of you know, sometimes a person with Autism will engage in rectal digging behavior and smearing for a variety of potential reasons.  I have an institutionalized patient who is highly Autistic, and one thing that they are dealing with regularly with him is rectal digging.  He will also sometimes put feces in his mouth.

In a setting like this, I would expect the staff to try to determine why the behavior is occurring so that a plan could be instituted to address the issue.  However, what I'm finding is that they have given up on the issue somewhat.  It's my job to try to find the least restrictive alternative to institutionalization that meets his needs, and this issue is beginning to be a barrier to his appropriate placement in a group home that would be more appropriate for him.

So, as someone who helps make sure that indigent individuals who need care get the help they need, I'm a psychologist but by no means an expert in any particular condition.  I was looking for hopefully some insight into your experiences as to what has helped solve this issue. For example, maybe worked with someone who was doing this because he liked the texture, and successfully implemented an alternative that lessened the behavior, insight like that.

One thing that I was considering asking them to do is to try installing a bidet attachment, that perhaps he is not getting fully clean and this is leading to the behavior, however he also loves water play, so that may be a recipe for disaster.  However, in my limited research I've found that there are numerous triggers for this sort of thing outside of simply the area being uncomfortable for the person.

""But youre not a child anymore. You dont have ADHD. Ask for a 2nd opinion, I can recommend a great dr for you. Otherwise, your just wasting time and money.""


... I passed by the registration and they politely reminded me that I still need to pay. So I did (it was minimal as I, fortunately, have a great insurance). But as I was paying, I made sure to voice my concerns loudly to everyone within earshot.

But im still sick and furious and waiting for my GF to drive me to the hospital.

"Ask me how Schizophrenic people are Psionic Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Michael J Coffey. I have been diagnosed with Schizophrenia and I hear voices often.

I don't believe I'm Schizophrenic. 

I believe I am Psionic.

I have scored on the 98th percentile of the ACT exam and I'm starting a startup.

[coffeyindustries.com](https://coffeyindustries.com)

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend everyone with a schizophrenia diagnosis to refuse neuroleptic treatment. 

It is my view that neuroleptics are generally poisonous substances, and that they have no positive effects.

"I feel like I'm on a head on collision course in super slow-mo, where I can see what I need to do to prevent it; but I can't (or won't) do anything about it. I'm an engineering major in college, and things are starting to heat up with my courses. Marking my first time going full time this semester. My workload is so large and I understand I need to work ahead to stay on top of things but I never ever do. Then when deadlines come up, I struggle last second to get it all done, hardly absorbing any of the material. 

This is the weird part too, I get this incredible feeling of guilt, shame, desperation, anxiety, self loathing when these deadlines come up and I promise myself not to let it happen again. I lay in bed for hours replaying all the time I wasted and I feel terrible.

Then once the deadlines pass and I turn in half assed work; *poof* **the feeling of dread goes away and life doesn't seems as shitty as it did before the deadlines.**

Does this sound like people who've been diagnosed? I haven't been diagnosed but I feel I show tons of ADHD symptoms. Its been fucking terrible and I have been questioning my abilities as an adult and have been feeling immensely inept... :(

"Loud Thoughts Before Sleep Feels like I'm just looking at myself from a window as I'm doing all sorts of weird things, just banging my hands on the glass and just begging myself to fall asleep.

I laugh whenever I feel like a failure. I have to exhaust my brain from when the thoughts become too loud and too rapid for me to keep up. I find it hard to be the person I want to be. Instead I'm just hearing a million voices telling me about meaningless things and twisting my memories in a terrible knot. 

And there's always someone else controlling me, and I just can't help but watch through some weird glass that bleeds out colour from the outlines of everything I see. 

But sometimes, there's colour that just feels dead.

I've been prescribed Risperidone for when thoughts get too loud, but I always feel terrible after I wake up from using it. It's a hangover, and I've never had a single drink in my entire life. 

Advice will be helpful, guys. Anything to stop the thoughts from being too loud and fast. Thank you.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"A positive Christmas post! My beautiful, amazing mother is aware of (she too struggles with ED behaviour and in the past had anorexia) my struggles and gave me for Christmas essentials instead of food or clothes (things that she knows I won’t touch) she bought me toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash, etc because she knows I care about my teeth crazily after previously being bulimic (now I’m closer to anorexic tendencies) and other essentials. I love her so much for that. 


She also for Christmas dinner made my safe foods and low calorie/healthy foods and options and desserts so that I’m not left out and the rest of my family doesn’t clue in on my restricting or habits. 


She’s so precious and I love her so much.

I believe I over react to other people's hate , but at the same time I don't necessarily want to numb out.

If I look at the people who make me feel paranoid, anxious, stressed...maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought all the time but they legitimately were people with bad intentions.

Then I find people with very good intentions and I notice they don't trigger me.  I'd go so far as to say when I was feeling anxiety very intensely the right person and people had to come to talk me down.  Heck I won't even call it anxiety I'd call it just absolute fear I was feeling at the time.

But there's certain types of people where you just know you don't have to worry about them.

People tell you that telepathy isn't valid.

"My son just had a pre screening for ADHD with his pediatrician. A few months ago I started my journey of finding out I had ADHD. I had original been diagnosed as bipolar and BPD. The BPD made sense but the bipolar not so much because I never felt manic and my depression was constant (although varying in levels through out). I had never considered ADHD until a coworker of mine mentioned that a lot of her symptoms were similar to my ""bipolar"" symptoms. That led me to do some research and my eyes nearly popped out of my skull. Holy crap. I have ADHD. A lot of things from my childhood made sense. Always feeling like I dragged down behind my peers because I could never sit and do homework or not being able to even attempt to study. I would study an hour before a test. I was naturally talented in school so I would be able to pass very easily despite my lack of studying. At least until I needed to study and things got harder. I almost failed out of high school and graduated by the skin of my teeth. 

Even before I suspected my own ADHD I had already started seeing the signs in my then 4 year old. Constant fidgeting, not listening to orders, delayed speech, ignoring his bodily functions, not wanting to eat because he had better things to do, constant non stop energy, so on and so forth. I has mentioned it to his teacher and she told me that he was too young for labels and that all kids were like that. I ignored it and moved on. 

Fast forward to my diagnosis and finally getting treatment that I decided to go ahead and schedule my now 5 year old for an appointment with his pediatrician. I refused to let him fall through the cracks like I did. Feeling like I had no self control or being constantly bombarded by family as to why I was so disorganized, forgetful, and basically unadult like. My self esteem suffered so much and even more so when I became a parent because I didn't suddenly become better like you're supposed to when you have kids. I felt like a horrible mother because it would be  12pm and I still hadn't managed to get out of bed to feed my son or I found it easier to be on my phone for 3 hours instead of interacting with him (children can be so freaking boring). 

I was only diagnosed a few months ago so I'm learning still about giving myself structure and now that it's almost certain that my son has it too I'm gonna start adding his structure to mine and vice versa. I want my son to be able to reach his potential and lead the happy life and childhood that I wasn't able to because of the notion that you can't be smart if you have ADHD.

"What’s hearing voices like? The last few hours, having not slept a great deal in the last 24 hours, I started having strange hallucinations while driving. I’d see things out the corner of my eye, constantly detect movement, and see clusters of clothes or rubbish as human figures. 

Then while imagining something, I’ll get lost in the train of thought and start imaging a random conversation between two people. I don’t ‘hear’ so much as think it, but I’m not in control of it. Also, when I close my eyes, I sometimes start to see strange faces, including human faces I’m positive I’ve never seen before. 

These effects seem to only present themselves during the transition between wake and asleep, and in times of sleep deprivation. 

However, the effects on my creativity and imagination seem enhanced. I ‘hear’ music in my head, imagined sounds and so forth, that I’m not responsible for rationally asking my brain to present these things.

"New to this sub and have some ??s Hi everyone. This is my first post and I have some questions.
My son is 9 and has ADHD inattentive type.
We made the decision we are going to move forward with meds because things have exploded in school since before the holidays.
We saw his doctor today after a meeting with the school, who recommended Concerta to trial beginning this weekend.
I've spoken to a colleague who has a child on this, who also works in the field with patients on this drug and she highly recommended too.
I went to the pharmacy on my way home from work however, and they said the cost for 30 pills even with my insurance is over $200 a month.
Is there a generic version that is typically cheaper?
The pharmacy was no help because they were super busy.
It was a long day so my mind is also kind of a blur of others she said as an alternative.
I plan to call the doctor in the AM so want to be prepared.

His issues really are that he is one of the highest achievers in his grade, is in a special STEM (formerly gifted and talented) program but recently starting to refuse/is unable to focus to do work. They are worried if this doesn't get addressed he will get kicked out of STEM which cannot happen.
His frustration is also escalating and he has started to have tantrums in school.

We are also requesting accommodations in the classroom.

My main concern is the meds though.

I will suck it up and pay it if there is no good alternative.

ETA: we also drop him off at 7am and don't pick him up from his after school program until 5 or 6 and sometimes later if there's a special event. How does this work with needing multiple doses? School nurse? My colleague said it initially worked with one of the meds her child tried because challenging classes were in earlier part of day before meds wore off. This was before switching to Concerta.

"I was diagnosed, and prescribed with life changing medication, then he retired spontaneously leaving me without the long term prescription.. what do I do now? (UK) Hey guys,

So in March 2017 I was diagnosed with ADD by a family psychiatrist (private funded by my dad's medical insurance through work) who saw me as a kid. He prescribed me with methylphenidate and atomoxetine.. Struggled a lot with that combination so he took the atomoxetine away and I felt the full effects of the methylphenidate. It was like a cloud had been lifted from my head, like pausing mid thought with ""uhmm"" and ""ahh"" had been minimised. 

Baring in mind I dropped out of University and moved home due to these severe concentration issues, on the meds for the hell of testing myself I took up a short course in astronomy and aced it. i felt on top of the world. I moved up North to Newcastle while still on these short term prescriptions he had set up. While my dad messaged him asking about setting me up with the long term prescription out of the blue the response was ""sorry I'm retiring"". 
(Only then did my mum reveal he's been going through some legal issues, a quick google of his name will show several results regarding controversy over kissing a young patient which I feel influenced this sudden retirement)

So I was a bit jimmied. AM a bit jimmied.

In this time i took up studying my NCTJ, a journalism qualification that will allow me to finish what I started at Uni, but now being off the methylphenidate I'm starkly reminded of how work used to feel.

Now the medical insurance no longer covers me, the NHS has had me waiting for over six months and I could be looking at another year of waiting and my exams are in three months. Oh and I cant seek the prescription from any other specialist as they require a diagnosis of their own, which I will be charged for (and who knows, unlikely but they might deem me not to have ADD) I guess I'm looking for thoughts, has anyone had experience of this through the NHS, any recommendations for private treatment in the UK?

"Childhood PTSD - and no one to talk to without being judged Hello everyone, I would like to share my traumatic childhood experience with you guys in hopes of getting judged by those I talk to about it. First things first, this is a throwaway account, and I apologize for my bad English , as it is not my first language, and I'm not the best writer out there.

A little bit of background first, I was born in 1985 in Indonesia (the country with the most Muslim citizens) to parents of Chinese descent, and I'm currently studying for my masters degree in Australia. In May 1998, when I was still 13 years old, a massive race and hate fuelled riot broke out in my country. I was living in Jakarta (Indonesia's capital city) at the time, and my big family from my mom's side all live not far from each other (family from dad's side live in a different state/province in a different island). My family were merchants, and they live off opening different kinds of shops in the city - one of my uncles owns a car workshop and spareparts store, my dad owns an electronics store, my other uncle owns a restaurant, and so on. I lived in a riverside home near the local river in an area called Glodok (which is sort of a shopping district in and of itself), and I went to a primary school not far from my house, which was a few houses down my uncle's car workshop (I'll refer to him as Uncle A from now on). 

I vividly remember I was in school when the riots broke out. I saw one of the shops near my house's area was burning,and I immediately started getting worried. I remember the teacher telling the students ""Finish whatever work you can, and go home immediately."" After I finished my work, I went home and as soon as I get home, my parents locked all the doors and windows. From my house, I can see one of my classmate's house across the river, his house was looted and his family car was burning. I also heard the masses shouting ""Kill the Chinese! Burn them alive! Loot their houses! They have no place in our Muslim country!""

When I asked my parents what was going on, they only replied with ""You wouldn't understand - this is a political issue.""

As the day goes on, I saw lots of people taking various items from the houses they looted, I saw a guy carrying a fridge on his back, and I even noticed some stuff from my uncle's car workshop getting taken.

The next day was even worse, the masses started burning the cars on my street, including my uncle's car. Many people died during the raid, and unfortunately my aunt were among the victims. She was raped before she was beaten to death and burned alive as I found out years later. 

I remembered having to carry a machete with me all the time, and taking turns with my dad watching the house entrance in case someone tries to get in. Schools were canceled until the situation died down, and it was a very traumatic experience overall.

Thankfully nothing else happened to my family, and when I returned to school some of my classmates weren't there - either dead or fled to another country.

Lately I got triggers from this traumatic event approaching my home country's presidential election, because one of the candidates is the mastermind who orchestrated the May 1998 riots. There has been a string of hate crimes towards the Chinese descents in Indonesia which I won't go into. I'm really worried about the safety of my family, and everytime I try to talk about this to a friend they judge me as being Islamophobic with the political situation in the West nowadays. I really don't know who to talk to about this without getting judged, and I hope this subreddit can give me some advice and input. Thank you very much.",ptsd,ptsd

"I want to make a GP appointment but I'm scared (suicide tw) Things got very overwhelming for me today. I talked about my trauma on another subreddit and someone downvoted it and nobody commented. I don't expect anyone to comment, but the downvote really knocked my confidence and I ended up getting myself into a state.

I've never been diagnosed with PTSD but I need to know if I have it or not, which is why I want to make a doctor's appointment. But I'm scared. I don't know what to say. 

My trauma occurred when I was 14 and my close friend told me that she'd attempted suicide. I'm 19 now and I have been so, so ill ever since. Especially anger. At times I felt so angry at suicide I literally saw red, started shaking, and thought I was going to have a heart attack. I have a lot of triggers that send the memories and emotions flooding back. Sometimes I am a danger to myself and gave gotten incredibly suicidal over it in the past.

There's a disconnect between current me and 14 year old me. Current me understands suicide and normally feels sympathy for those who die: but 14 year old me is still trapped in there somewhere and starts shrieking in my head whenever I hear about suicide. 

I also feel...I feel as though my trauma is harking other people. I want to talk about how angry suicide makes the 14 year old me in my head and let all her feelings out and show her she doesn't have to be ashamed of having extreme emotions over the event that traumatized her. But I don't want to hurt anyone who has attempted suicide in the past. I'm afraid that if I talk about being traumatized, they will feel guilty. It's exhausting. It's just exhausting.

I also feel like if I do get a PTSD diagnosis, I'll be betraying my friend. I'm afraid it'll ruin our friendship. I don't want to lose her but I don't want to act like everything's okay either. I feel ashamed of myself for being so messed up. Everyone else dealt with her suicide attempt just fine. It's just me who couldn't.

"[Long Vent] School is just so fucking treacherous for me and I just can't fucking deal with it anymore I'm a 10th grader in high school in a program called IB (International Baccalaureate), well, Pre-IB anyway, and I have no fucking clue what I'm doing here. I'm really glad I did it because had it not been for the intense workload compared to other high schoolers I wouldn't have ever had the frequent mental breakdowns that led me to threatening to call CPS on my psychologically abusive parents for neglect if they don't get me a therapist back in January 2017 that led me to *finally* going in for my first session in August (for whatever godforsaken reason when we got the referral from my pediatrician in January, my then therapist said I can go in for my first session in June, but then our insurance companies fought over who-knows-what in court and I had to scramble to get a new one before I ever even so much as saw my first one and my second therapist allowed me to go in for therapy in August), but my therapist makes me feel guilty for things much like my parents do but without all the yelling and manipulation and scolding, and he doesn't speak much and sort of tries to push me to lead the therapy session by probing me with vague questions like ""so what's going on?"" (buddy... a lot... we see each other monthly at best) and he starts the 30-minute sessions five minutes late each time and for the first five minutes he's always fooling around on his computer skimming through Fox News headlines (which was a huge red flag for me at first, because I thought, he's a psychologist, shouldn't he know better than anyone that Fox News is infamous for brainwashing and spewing false ""facts""), but then I started disregarding it like okay whatever he probably doesn't have any other time during the day to do this, and plus I almost never get to see him for a myriad of reasons (I didn't see him at all September because in August we agreed on once a month and it was the end of August, October just once, November and December were going to be twice each, but he had a family emergency and wasn't able to attend either, January we went to one meeting but for the second one we had to reschedule it because he was going on vacation but then my mom and I forgot about it and, lastly, he got back from his vacation pretty late and I only had one session in February). So not only do I see him pretty fucking rarely, but when I do see him, it's shit therapy that doesn't make me feel better in any way, shape, or form. Thankfully though my mom said my next therapy session will be my last one with him, and after that I'm going to get a new therapist, but she isn't on board with getting a ""psychiatrist who specializes in depression and ADHD"" because I ""don't need meds"" (she asked my pediatrician if I needed antidepressants and she said no... well that's all handy dandy but 1) she's a pediatrician, not a psychiatrist 2) I mentioned that I wanted meds for adhd, not mdd, 3) from what I've seen here from lurking so much it looks damn near impossible to improve your adhd without meds, and 4) even if I don't need meds right now, if I do later on I'll need to be referred to a psychiatrist which will be a whole nother set of hoops I'm not willing to jump through just because you're too obstinate to not put me through that)

I'm also thankful because IB is such a huge opportunity and I don't want to miss out on it because I'm really fucking thankful to have had the luck to be put in such a position as to be able to not only be aware of how great it is (my brother is currently in med school and when he was in college, one of the first things he said was that he was really glad he did IB because he found college significantly easier than his peers did thanks to all the good habits he had to build through IB), but to actually have gotten accepted into the program back when my grades were good (unlike today hA!), and also because I've put in way too much effort to make backing out now meritable at all, especially now that first semester of sophomore year (the latest you're allowed to transfer from one public magnet program to another in my school district) has already passed. My zoned public school isn't the *worst* but it's still bad compared to the others, and I'd honestly rather just suck it up and continue with IB than go there. I can ask for permission to drop out and keep going to my current school as a traditional student (ie, no magnet program), **but only when I become a senior, at which point it's *definitely* too late to back out.**

My mental health has been rapidly deteriorating from the already extremely low point it was already at and now I'm always no higher than being somewhere between simply dead inside and on the verge of tears. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up again because I have so many fucking things due this week I just can't handle it and all that on top of my Depression and ADHD on top of that fact that they've developed minds of their own with the only goal in mind being to go deeper than the fucking Mariana Trench, plus with my highly unsupportive parents who think it's all my fault and won't so much as hug me because I said ""nevermind"" which is ""extremely crass of me to say"" when they asked what I said when I was talking to myself. What it was that I said was ""I have no idea how I'm going to handle college when I can't even handle *this*."", and I'm sure you can see why I'm cracking under pressure. Today, I had a 200-point test in English on Greek mythology and a project and workbook questions due in chem. Tomorrow I have a 300-point binder I have to fill out with 19 long, time-consuming assignments that I had the entire grading period (Jan. 8-today) to do due in history in addition to a couple hours of precalc problems. Wednesday nothing's due (bless), Thursday 10 chapters of Their Eyes Were Watching God have to be annotated (I can't BS it because she actually checks it), and Friday is a test in precalc on polar coordinates and also a 600-word essay on the Cold War in history. Oh, and did I add that I missed Thursday, and have to make up a history test on WW1+2? I meant to go on Friday but I couldn't because he wasn't in his room because of FSA (Florida Standards Assessment) testing. I doubt he was even at school; plenty of my teachers who weren't proctors weren't and I don't think he was one. Then, yesterday, I missed school for the same reason as Thursday, and the same reason as all other 18 days of absence I have: being a heavy sleeper who has to get up at 5:45 (really it's more like 5:00, but I stopped eating breakfast or putting in more than 5 minutes of effort towards making myself look presentable [including time spent finding and putting on clothes]; plus whenever I *do* hear my alarm I just snooze until 5:55 anyways) just to leave the house at 6:05 and bike a whole mile in 10 minutes on the highest gear (all the lower ones don't work) with the noodle legs I have who also has depression, ADHD, and suicidal thoughts, and who also sleeps like 3-4 hours a night what from staying up all night every night promising myself to do work (but never actually doing so) is just a recipe for failure, failure in this case being having only gone to school 105 days out of 123. It's honestly such a miracle that I've even gone to school as many days as I have, tbh. And of course my parents always ask me when they get home, ""why weren't you at school?!?"" as if one of these times they're bound to get something different as a response, and of course they don't like my answer so instead of offering to actually help and tackle my issues with me, they just tell me some fucking bullshit about how I can't be depressed, *they're* depressed, I'm just 15 and they're 54, and how my ADHD is just a behavioral issue, and about how if I just tried harder I'd be able to get up in the morning if I just tried harder (like I haven't tried that already) and then they go on about all the struggles they've faced. Like yeah, I get it, it really sucks that you had to move here all the way from Venezuela and learn English etc. etc. etc. I'm not saying none of that sucked. But 1) at least you're neurotypical, meaning you and I have never, and probably will never have experiences the same suffering (that isn't to say only one of us has suffered though, smfh), 2) your suffering is completely irrelevant and you're just using it to be an asshole, and 3) even if one of us has suffered more than the other, that isn't a good enough reason to completely squash all over the other's suffering and say it isn't real and that they don't know what real suffering is.

Anyways, sorry for that really long tangent, back to my studies: I really have no will to do anything at all and it's really fucking scary because I fear for my future. I really want to go to college and become a physicist because it's what I absolutely love, and I love learning and not to be cocky or anything but I know I'm smart because teachers have pointed out to me multiple times that they know I'm the smartest student in the class but that I just have ""so much potential"" (...thanks? this is a blow to my self-worth, not a boost, but whatever) and I was a gifted child, so I *know* I have it in me, but I just can't access it. Starting is a hassle what with executive dysfunction and whatnot, but then there's also my depression getting in the way and making me overwhelmed by making me cry from stress and giving my suicidal thoughts all because I can't fucking work, so naturally the little five-minute sessions of work I get in here and there throughout this whole nightmare always results in like, what, one paper a night? I could go on and on about all this but I won't because I feel the tangent was necessary since it adds perspective to my suffering and I feel like I got the message across with that little short tidbit at the end and this is already getting terribly long enough and I don't want to just add to that length.

**TL;DR:** Depression, ADHD, terrible parents, and a rigorous high school program are all fucking me up mentally and I'm lost and confused and I don't know what to fucking do (honestly please just read the whole thing if you choose not to ignore this post) and I'm really desperate for help, I feel like I'm holding onto my life by a thread, except the thread is hot and it burns my hands and what lies below is too far to see and all I can do is wait until some unknown psychiatrist comes to the rescue with *actual* therapy and a letter written to the school explaining what's going on so I can get some accommodations and deadline extensions (wishful thinking though tbh, with my shitty school district and whatnot) and I'm forced to hold on because I'd rather suffer what I'm currently going through than what I could be potentially going through if I don't.

"Slow motion train wreck The first time I drank alcohol just for the effect was in 1999. Twenty years ago. At the time, I was 30 years old on a business trip and extremely stressed. I had two beers and suddenly my stress was gone. A miracle. Over the next twenty years, my drinking increased, but very slowly. To this day, I've never had a DUI, never missed work, never been arrested, never needed to drink in the morning. Now, I have a very finite time I like to drink: roughly between 4 p.m. and whenever I have dinner, which is usually between 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. In the span of those 2-3 hours I'll drink anywhere from 6-10 drinks. Once I have dinner, I stop drinking, watch some television or a movie and go to bed. Not too bad, right? I titled this article ""slow motion train wreck"" because over those twenty years I've tried to stop drinking or cut back and have failed. I've been to AA meetings, read every book on addiction, tried therapy multiple times, hired a fitness coach and on and on. I don't drink every day, but at least a few times a week. I've gained about 70 pounds in the last fifteen years. My health sucks. I'm 52 but I feel like 72.

I just stumbled onto this sub and Im stoked! Been reading through the posts and this is honestly the best community I've ever seen. I think part of it is the recognition I experience when reading your posts. I've literally had 20 moments in the past 5 minutes where I went, ""Well fuck me, he does that too?!"" It feels really liberating to find a group of people who understand each other.

There was one post I read that spoke about intentions and the lack of actions to follow through with it. This is my biggest problem and I was hoping to get some much needed advice from you guys.

I get these short intense passions for a week, perhaps a month or two and then all my interest in the topic vanishes. Two weeks ago I stumbled onto an amazing idea for a company and Ive been reading about startups ever since. I told my parents about my intentions and basically got laughed at first and then they told me to just keep my job and don't do it.

However, I do want to do it. Its driving me crazy, knowing that I will probably quit halfway through... So my question to you guys is: What do you do to keep yourself motivated/disciplined enough to follow through?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading this far, I know it isn't easy to read a looong block of text, but Im happy you made it :)",adhd,adhd
"LCSW or Psychologist? Hi there, first time poster! 

I just recently started seeking out therapy, because I've finally decided I'm done being a dark, brooding, hateful type and I want to get better. However, it looks like my insurance only covers LCSW? Or that's all I've been able to find in this area.

I've never had a psychologist or psychiatrist, so I'm not sure what the difference is. The LCSW I go to has a religious theme I'm not sure I'm a fan of, but I'm wondering if it would be any better with someone else or should I stick it out. 

They also focus on ALL of me, instead of just the PTSD. I get that after it being in my life for a while that it's a part of me, but sessions are all over the place. 

What I'm saying is will the experience be the same with other types of therapy?

"Does Caffeine also act as a ""mood upper"" for some of y'all also? Please explain. How? I used to use caffeine (coffee, redbulls, mtn dew, basically any source I could get) as a way to help me focus better in class because I have always struggled with ADHD my whole life, but shortly after, it became obsolete for reasons I am unsure about. Depression started taking its affect on me around my sophomore year of High School and still affects me daily. I was never officially diagnosed with either disorders/deficits till this year (my parents never really believed in the legitimacy of mental health issues) due to extremely unfortunate circumstances that I would rather not get into in depth. But in short, my depressive symptoms and acute stress at the time clouded my rationality and finally made me carry through with an attempt at my life. I was then sent to a Psych ward to which I had to spend my Christmas at. Oddly enough, the experience was an eye opener for me and I am grateful for what had happened. My issues were finally starting to get addressed. However, the means of which my depression was tackled wasn't ideal. I was put on Lexapro and Welbutrin. I absolutely hate the Lexapro. It helped with my appetite and sleep, but it made me feel anxious, sexually impotent and, simply put, weird. I, however, liked the welbutrin. It was diagnosed to me for my ADHD, but that is only because it was alarmingly cheaper than the cost of stimulant meds. It helped me moderately with brain fog and helped me mentally ""slow down"" when I was going through my daily bouts of extreme hyperactivity and irritability. My teachers and friends thought I was more amicable. I also fell asleep a lot less frequently in boring classes. I, however, hated the lexapro, so I stopped taking it for about a week. I then ran out of welbutrin. I set up an appointment with a psychiatrist and a therapist for a session of psychotherapy and I look forward to it, but asides from this, I have many questions in regards to old habits. Because I have been ""low"" on medication, I have been consuming alarmingly high levels of caffeine again. My ADHD symptoms aren't quiet as relieved as they were on the welbutrin, however, my depression is at bay; I could even argue that it is much milder than it was when I was on lexapro. Because of this and my already high interest in psychiatry an pharmacology, I looked into how many ADHD meds and some anti-depressants work and discovered that drugs like welbutrin work similarly to stimulants like caffeine and ritalin, and can also be prescribed along with other stimulant meds to help counteract the depression associated with the ADD side of ADHD. I thought it was really interesting, and I plan to bring it up to my psychiatrist when we meet. I felt like it was important to write about because I feel that I can't be the only one (with depression and comorbid ADHD) who has experienced this phenomenon with stimulants and similar medication. Does Caffeine also act as a ""mood upper"" for some of you depressed ADHD folk? I'm curious.

"Minor victories. Hey, I just wanted to share some minor victories I achieved over the weekend. 

On Friday, my boiler pressure dropped and I couldn't work out how to top it up. I managed to call the maintenance team for my apartment building, who sent someone out to fix it. That's a HUGE deal for me - I don't like making phone calls, especially not ones asking for help, and letting strangers into my home is also a big deal. 

On Saturday it was my boyfriends birthday, so we went for a meal out with his friends, and then to a bar. I really struggle in big groups of people, especially ones I don't know well. I made it through the meal and a few hours in the bar - I did have to come home early, but he's a sweetheart and purposefully picked a bar a few minutes walk from my apartment so I could do that easily if I had to. 

Then on Sunday, I had a video call with my Step-Father. He lives a few thousand miles away, and although we've emailed and talked on messenger, we haven't spoken 'properly' for about 7 or 8 years. It was great to have a catch up with him, and I enjoyed it so much we're making it a monthly thing, and I'm also arranging a video call with one of my friends in Australia too. I've struggled with webcams in the past, as I'm never convinced they're properly off.

"am i anorexic?? okay so tea is i think i have anorexia. i’m 15(almost 16🤪🤩), about 5’6” and 105lbs, and my waist is 25.5 inches (that one probably doesn’t matter). up until like a month or two ago, when i started to get “bigger” (for lack of a better word), i was about 5’5”, 100lbs, and had a 24 inch waist. that was when i was happy with my appearance because i always looked skinny and that made me happy. ever since then, i started measuring my waist regularly because i always wanted to make sure my waist was the same size, and i continued on because when i noticed i started getting bigger i always thought i look fat even when i know in the back of my head that i look skinny to other people, maybe even too skinny. sometimes i talk about how fat i am and my mom yells at me and tells me basically that i’m a boy and i can’t have an eating disorder and to stop being a sissy gay or to stop being a girl or something along those lines (please don’t think negatively of my mom she’s so amazing i love her to death). i don’t really like to talk about it with my friends because although they always try to hype me up and tell me i’m skinny and i look good, etc. i feel like they’re empty compliments and they’re just trying to make me happy. i only started thinking this when my friend made a comment on how she thinks i may be anorexic. i did a little bit of research and i think it may be true. i’ve been really depressed lately over my appearance bc of how big i look in my stomach and not anywhere else, which only triggers more sadness, which causes me to stress eat, this restarting the cycle. i’ve cried probably 4 times today. i just don’t know what to do or where to go with this like i’m so stuck and confused and i feel so anxious and depressed and just overall unhappy. almost every time i pass a mirror, i stop and lift up my shirt and contemplate whether or not i look skinny- which to others i probably do but i don’t think so- which also causes me to be sad sometimes. i just feel like a weight that hangs over my head and i just feel like depressed, anxious, a feeling of apprehension, etc. even writing this, my chest feels heavy like i’m going to cry. i literally just have no idea what to do. i want to start eating good and going to the gym because i know doing this will help me get a flat stomach and like bigger arms and legs and such, which will make me happy, and just all around more healthy and happy, but my mom is reluctant to because we had one a few months ago and i only went a couple times because of school and stuff. it’s also really hard to eat good foods and meal plan and stuff because we’re kind of struggling with money and my mom is saving up to move soon so we’re constantly buying fast food and the cheapest and easiest foods to make, which isn’t helping anything. i literally have no idea where or who to turn to and i feel so sad all the time for the past few days...... sorry if this post was a mess, but there are so many thoughts that are going through my head and i have no idea how to organize them for anyone to read. thank you so much if you preserved long enough to read all of this, i really appreciate it.",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

My question for you: do you have any kind of trick or tip what you do when it gets really worse besides the medication, which I don't want to take in front of others? (nobody, except my mother and one friend, knows about my ""problem). I'm grateful for any help. I hope it's okay to post this here. Thank you. ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Applying for Underqualified Jobs I've been struggling with getting a job after having my psychotic break about a year ago. My background includes quite a bit of what people would call ""success,"" in salary-level jobs. I also have three degrees (two Bachelor's, one Master's). It was the experience of getting the Master's which pushed me over the edge, and I haven't been able to recover since. I've tried applying to a number of low level jobs, mostly at public libraries, because that would use the skills I earned during my Master's (I studied Literature and Art). However, each time I've applied, everyone seems to think I'm overqualified.

On my applications, I have listed all of my work experience. Has anyone tried not listing their entire employment history due to these sorts of qualification issues? In my cover letters, I have not disclosed my mental health status, nor the reason for my gap in employment. Given these issues, would you recommend I disclose details within my cover letters from now on, or would that put up a red flag? Given that I apply primarily to public service jobs, I figured they would not to discriminate, and even make affordances for those with disability backgrounds, but I live in a very conservative area of the country. What makes this even worse is that without a job like this, I would, in effect, be barred from the social and mental health services that I badly need (I live in the country with family where no services exist, but these jobs would be in a nearby city where these services do exist).",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

I've been good about drinking in moderation, the last time I binged was over 8 months ago, but when things get tough I tend to just go overboard. I'm hoping this week of not being able to drink jump starts a lifestyle of sobriety again. I'm tired of letting drinking control my life, I'm tired of waking up and thinking of all those regrettable choices I made, or just trying to remember everything. Its time I stop making excuses, and work and stick to sobriety. It's hard, but not as hard as waking up the next morning not knowing what happened the last day, or last couple days. I'm at a good position in my job, I do good, and I think that's why my managers let it slide as much as they do, but I'd like to see better for myself because I know I can be better.

I looked at the menu of the restaurant despite having been there multiple times and I couldn’t find anything acceptable. I couldn’t justify spending money, especially as I’ve spent so much this month and I’m too fat to see her, especially as she’s lost some weight herself. Healthily, at that.

"I finally know why it has been so hard throughout my life. Well throughout my early childhood I was always an active kid, and always getting into trouble school and home, doing the regular kid stuff, Grade School really sucked for me, always struggled in class, and homework, and not to mention I was always that ""annoying kid"" that would always talk too much or play around, and disrupt class. I grew up not having a lot of friends and which til this day I am reluctant to have friends due to the reason they might find me annoying. Failed the 4th grade, and struggled through middle school and eventually high school. People just labeled me a problem child or troubled kid. which I wasn't a bad kid, just I acted out, played around, talked too much. Ended up dropping out of high school, and eventually got the GED 2 yrs after. I started to work in the ER as a Scribe and I liked it, Fast paced and good pay. now 8yrs since then, I'm in college, going for RN. So difficult to complete my homework let alone read my chapters. We just recently went over the Mental health and ADHD, and during lecture, it was describing me, and which I was like ""WTF"" I spoke to my professors and even a mental health FNP, and they all agree I have ADHD, and which tell me to go talk to my Doctor about it. but I think about it, and just think to myself, i act the way I do not cause I'm immature or childish, its how my mind works, blaming myself for a lot of being ""lazy"" in school, not trying hard enough, and just being labeled as ""that annoying kid"". I tried to control my behavior throughout my life so far, and which I asked my mom why we never been seen by a specialist when I was younger, she said I wasn't bad. I now just accept that it wasn't my fault, and I am going to be going to a low-cost clinic for me (behavior specaillist for low income won't see adults with adhd,  would have to see free standing speciallist and with me being low income it wouldnt be able financially) and will be discussing what I can do, but so far My schooling i have found that if I drink monster/Redbull/NOS drinks and Listen to Techno EDM music i can concentrate and get work done (not really read tho) but its a refresher that it wasn't just me, it was my mind.

"I was diagnosed today at 31 &amp; people are mad about it Hello frens,

This is my first post to this sub, only very recently learning that a lifetime of struggle isn’t because I am inherently lazy or bad person. I am very happy with my diagnosis and look forward to being able to *not* leave socks all over the house like an Easter egg hunt for my husband.

I informed my 3 best friends this afternoon and their responses were weirdly aggressive. One said that according to *her* I am the exact opposite of someone who has ADHD, and I “need to get off all the medication, eat right, go for walks, practice gratitude.” 

*oh god, thank you for clearing that up for me*

My other two friends were aloofly skeptical after initial astonishment and they stopped texting back almost immediately.

What gives? My Mom thinks I’m faking it just to “get pills” and that SHE is the one who needs to be diagnosed with it.

I haven’t told my husband yet. He will most likely infer that I lead the dr on just so I could get a diagnosis. This isn’t true at all, it was my massive fear going in to the appointment today. 

I am wondering if anyone has also had people in their lives react like they are offended when you are diagnosed as an adult?

TL;DR: got diagnosed today, people are mad/skeptical about whether I really have it, DAE have this happen?

"Thoughts on my dilemma So, I'm prescribed 25mg x 3 times a day chlorpromazine. Over semester 1 last year I gained a lot of weight from taking it and overeating, as a result of taking it and getting cravings and really just letting myself go. 

So now I'm doing dry January, I've given up smoking, pizza, fizzy pop, creamy pasta (I eat a lot of heavy cream pasta) and am comitting to self care and eating vegetables. I'm going to try and exercise again too. 

So all is great right? Well, here's the dilemma. I'd really like to lose the weight I gained, but chlorpromazine makes me gain weight. I haven't taken any chlorpromazine today and I'm just sitting watching television and I feel anxious, paranoid and am having mild auditory delusions/hallucinations. I feel a craving for the sanity and the peace that the chlorpromazine brings, at risk of sounding dramatic, almost like a withdrawal.

Should I just give in and take the medication? Or should I try to stay strong with the goal of losing weight in mind? The way I feel right now terrifies me, I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life, but feeling this way is just horrible. It makes me feel like I want to be dead. 

As an aside, does anyone have any suggestions for coping techniques for schizophrenia symptoms? (I have read on Google but Reddit often brings different insight) - felt the need to explain that because I was paranoid that people would tell me just to look up online how to cope.

"Mydayis side effect r/t food I've been tried on a bunch of meds so far-Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse. Vyvanse was a godsend. OMG, I feel so normal on it. Focus, control, it's amazing.

The price tag's a little difficult, however. So when Mydayis became available, my psychiatrist and I decided to try it, for savings to a tune of $270 a month. Now that my dose is appropriate, I like it. It's not quite as great as Vyvanse, but the difference is so slight that the savings make it more than worth it.

I've noticed a few side effect differences. The biggest good one is that Mydayis doesn't make my nose cold and runny like the Vyvanse. The worst is that food is just so unappealing.

I don't mean the appetite suppressant effects, that's been pretty consistent for all the amphetamines. (Down to 260 from 315 in the last year, so not complaining.) I mean that when I do eat, everything tastes...off. Not good. Bland at best and gross at worst.

I'll try to make this short. Ever since I was a kid I have always been incredibly withdrawn when around people. I was okay around immediate family and very close friends, but when around people I didn't have a deep connection with (which was pretty much everyone except for a select few) I would completely shut down. I remember my stomach would get extremely tight and simultaneously my brain felt like it was being shut off. I couldn't find words so I wouldn't talk. From ages 3-15 I went through school only talking if I was forced to (usually by teachers), which resulted in me never saying a word for 95% of the time. I would try to communicate with others by body language (nodding head, shrugging shoulders, etc), because I was unable to talk to them. Even when I wanted to, immense fear would wash over me and I would clam up even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hated this about myself but for the majority of my school years I couldn't change even though I desperately wanted to. When freshman year started and I was in a new school, I made it my mission to get over this and talk more. I was able to progress slightly for about a year and a half, but halfway through sophomore year I started becoming severely depressed (which lasted throughout the rest of highschool), and I reverted back into my old self.

I was told that I was ""just shy as a kid,"" but I know it was something deeper than that. The thing is I don't know why I acted that way.

"PTSD and digitizing childhood vhs tapes Hi, I need to talk about this because I don't have anyone I'm comfortable sharing with.

I am going to bring up a couple things that I'm struggling with and share some background so this makes sense. I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.

I realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.

**Background**

Growing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she ""made it to where I didn't have to testify"". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.

I had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by ""quickly and physically ending the disagreement"". After hearing that I got out of his car, said ""goodbye"" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for ""leaving"" them.

**The Videos**

I started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought ""Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first."" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled ""1996"" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying ""no"" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?

I was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from ""1996"" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks ""right?"" to my sister and she says something like ""only mom and dad think \_\_\_\_\_\_ is a brat."" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.

I gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled ""1996"". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were ""married"" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our ""marriage"" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.

My childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what ""grown ups do when they get married"". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because ""kissing isn't cheating"". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.

I hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.

**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**

I have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't ""do anything"". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.

I also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to ""practice having sex"" with me ""because we are best friends"" and he ""felt like I would give him feedback"" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.

There was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.

I'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened. I feel I am though.",ptsd,ptsd

"This may sound strange but i have to know how people think about this   

Hello..

&amp;#x200B;

So over the years I came to see more and understand more of reality.. and I am now questioning psychosis and the way they give people like that a diagnosis and a print that you are what they think you are….   
 

what I see is there are 2 types of people on this world…  
 

\- people that are conscious or getting conscious   
 

\- and people that just are.. and there is nothing wrong with that everybody got his or her process to go through in order to become more conscious now or in another life   
 

now to talk about the psychoses or getting conscious part I think there are 2 types of people in this case

\- the simple mind that has created a psychoses 

\- The conscious mind coping with everything wicked stuff that others see ass normal..

Not because many go right is that the right way... now with that said I like to continue 

I always had problems with people, society, family and more i now see that this is because there is no room for people like me the system is made to keep people like me out.. some know it and some do it subconsciously.. and don’t know it at all.. like family members..

I became wiser in the process because of all the pain stress and what more and i think this is something allot of this sort of people had to go through... To then point and say that human is psychotic is a simple minded western way of thinking and that’s why allot wont be helped how they need to be helped in understanding that it is a process that you wont solve by staying in wickedness…   
 

someone ones told me one can be in hell physically because they have become conscious in mind this means.. you see it all more for what it is then most do and it eats on your morals and honesty to yourself and others.. what is good and bad…   
   
 

but to continue……….

i understand more than most people around me.. I see this in how i think and how others think in general where their actions will take them in the future and how wickedness lets them do stuff that is just not right and wont help them in wisdom……. If you’re a normal being you can see this clearly also in the world around you its not that hard… but most people don’t know where it comes from they just do….  
 

Wickedness and not being conscious is for me the same because you go through life accepting what has been given to you… When everything they gave is wicked and to keep people in a zombie status.. From family that is just simple and not conscious to schools doing stuff out of love to making you ready to be a slave to countless ""fun"" ways that are actually wicked and subconsciously making you wicked and emotionless in mind.. And I’m not like that..... So the only thing they know is introducing you in to the system but when your woke you see how bad it actually is to do that.. When the system is and always was broken.. its designed to work in away and fall in away  
   
 

i also see that you become what you surround yourself with i see this because i decided instead of giving my life and mind to a therapist and pills (after already trying it and seeing and finally understanding that smartness has nothing to do with being conscious and wise) i saw that they could not help because you only see what you can comprehend and subconscious wickedness can come wrapped in love and willingness to help but not knowing better..…..  
 

I will say that again subconscious wickedness can come wrapped in love…..

i decided to leave this all and go in to the world.. But I’m still human so i came back and i see clearly how this place keeps pulling on my mind to do wicked stuff that empty headed people see ass normal.. So i will leave again  
 

me.. I don’t care about degrees or my status in society or money or simple mindedness or whatever does not push through to become conscious… because I think this is cheating not caring about yourself and others.. I believe that we were given this body to experience gain wisdom and become more conscious.. And the ones doing this are being seen now ass unstable and bad when its the other way around  
 but I do understand that not all are ready to do that..

but people that most of the time subconsciously without knowing are pulling you in to their ways because they never changed them is not right..  
   
 

I am really sensitive to energy, emotions, simple mindedness, light, thoughts and more.. I don’t let all energy in to my area because I don’t want to take in what they got or ruined my day with strange behavior…I am more on my own and what more…..  I know now that this are things they link to psychosis form their perspective but I also know that this to other people is linked to indigo children… you see the perspective of what I mean the simple mind sees it ass wrong when the conscious minded ones see it ass a process.. to go through that most don’t finish.. because they have nowhere to turn to so it evolves in pain, aggression, loneliness, abuse, addiction and more then they turn to the same system to help them and they get dulled down with pills and more to fit back in to the system that is broken in the first place… 

LISTEN I WANT TO SAY THIS..   
 

DONT TAKE ANY ADVICE FROM SOMEONE THAT IS NOT CONSCIOUS AND THINKS SMARTNESS IS THE KEY JUST DONT.. SMARTNESS YOU GAIN BY COPYING WHAT IS PRESENTED TO YOU.. TO THEN FURTHER AN AGENDA IN THIS CAUSE A BROKEN SYSTEM…  WISDOM IS GAINED BY GOING INTO YOURSELF AND THEN INTO THE WORLD, EXPERIENCING AND BY FALLING AND GETTING BACK UP.. FOLLOW WISDOM..

To keep it short what im trying to say is go in to the world and find yourself its a process that a view only understand its difficult but staying in a wicked place when you become conscious… just dont   
 Surround yourself with people that were brave enough to take that step even if the world left you to rot for it..

""Indigo children"" are real and i am one of them and most likely you are 2 you just gave up or are still in a process or you are to busy and distracted to really see it.. 

(I am also still in the process I never stop learning just so you know)

"Recently diagnosed, and I have questions about being a morning person VS a night person I was diagnosed this December and since August (when I started my PhD program) I have been trying to improve my routine and lifestyle. I figured that waking up early in the morning and working out, so that I didn't feel too lazy or tired in the afternoon to workout (plus thats when most of my peers were doing HW, and I needed to study with them). The classwork/studying in the evening thing isn't as much of a concern anymore, so I could (in theory) be a night owl again. I could just go back to my 2 AM bedtime and 8AM wake up time, but I want to ""be better"" than before i.e. I don't want to be wasteful late at night (when I'm usually around video games, friends wanting to drink, etc.) and NEED to get more done. 


However, in light of the ADHD diagnosis I've been wondering ""Is it even possible for me to be a morning person""? I heard ADHD people tend to be night owls so I thought maybe there was some hard wired circadian rhythm issues associated with ADHD. And if it is possible to be a morning person, did you guys see that it helped you? Or did it just make you ADHD and unproductive in the morning instead of the night haha",adhd,adhd

I do this quirky little thing where I self-diagnose due to the anxiety of talking about my problems and the general lack of money and insurance, so about maybe 4 or 5 years ago when I was 13/14 I secretly convinced my self I had some type of schizotypal disorder.

"I just got my official diagnosis, and am now being referred to a CPT focused therapist. (TW: child sexual abuse) My trauma is related to prolonged (over several years) sexual abuse when I was younger by a family member.  I ignored this fact, or told myself that it wasn't that bad, for the last 17ish years.  Within the last year, I've admitted to myself that I lived through very traumatic events and I started pursuing professional help.  My PCP originally diagnosed me with GAD, prescribed medication, and suggested I start seeing a therapist. After several sessions, my therapist has diagnosed me with PTSD and has suggested a therapist that specializes in Cognitive Processing Therapy.  She's suggested that I do this in conjunction with our sessions, or at the very least, pick our sessions back up at the end of the 12 week timeframe for the CPT therapist. 

Until today, I wasn't familiar with this type of therapy.  After looking into it.

I cried when she turned around to leave i couldnt hold back the tears of emotion knowing someone did care and out of juat pure love came up and said something so supportive in my struggle.

I don't know what I'm going to do, and I'm not sure how I'm going to cope with the plethora of other issues I have as an individual, but I have hit an ultimatum. I have a choice between making a change or committing suicide. I'm going to try to change. I'm at a new college. I feel completely alone here. I am completely alone here. I've made many amazing friendships elsewhere, but those are scattered miles and miles away from me. I used to drink to party.....in earlier years of college and in high school. Now it just fills the voids. My inadequacies. My lack of any friendship at all at this new place. I started using it to beat my social anxiety, now that I have to quit I have to figure out how I'm going to not act like a total weirdo in public. I'll have to come to terms with the many things in my life I'm not particularly fond of.....My past, my mistakes, my somewhat toxic family. It stops the pain when I drink it, but sometimes not even during that anymore, because it's typically solitary drinking. Eventually the pain goes away, but when I wake up it's always in immense panic and anxiety. I'm so frightened that the anxiety is physically hurting my body. I'm afraid I may go through withdrawl. I'm too busy as a student to detox or go to rehab. If I feel like I'm going to die I might try to ween, but I don't think I'm even capable of that. I'm just going to hope stopping doesn't kill me. It filled a void for so long, without it a lot of me is going to feel empty. I hope I can find something to fill that void back up. I hope I can do this, because I'm so lonely and I think about suicide constantly now. I'm so fucking scared. I'm too scared to leave my apartment to get food.

If you believe in God, pray for me. If you don't, wish me luck. I don't know if I'm going to beat this, but for the first time in years I'm going to try. I'm out of other choices.

"Is this normal? I am scared. I think I might be experiencing DTs but I can’t really find that much info about what I should be expecting but I feel really rough. My last drink was roughly 12 hours ago, I typically have a 6-pack a day occasionally more, have only had beer for last couple weeks. I have dried out before from heavier stuff and had very few side effects so this is scary.

I started off okay, started to notice some shaking which has gotten progressively worse. If I lay down my trunk keeps lifting me up and my neck keeps jerking forward. I’ve never had a seizure so it’s alarming me quite a bit. Have had the shakes before but not to this extent. 

I have also completely and utterly cleared my guts out to the point I am just throwing up bile. I’m not necessarily nauseous but several times I have gotten a very strong urge to just hurl and when I do it lasts for awhile and it hurts. I have not eaten for about 10 hours and have no desire to try, trying to drink water but I think it triggers the puking. I have anxiety from hell as it is but I have gotten to the point of hyperventilating several times tonight and my breathing is shallow even when I try to take a deep breath. It isn’t helping.

Has anyone experienced this? Does it sound like DTs?

All of which happened so I could continue to be raped and used as a sex object. 
And of course the abuse didn’t stop there it went on for years, leaked into every part of my life and flourished like an infestation of evil. 
Hooray for my childhood.

Somehow this made me hyper vigilant and unable to trust anyone or too trusting which got me in even more irreversible trouble. 

It’s as if I’m a wounded animal in a pack that is continuously targeted by others preying on the weak. 

I remember being punished for my resulting apparent cowardice by being beaten up and spit on and various other corrective measures by kids in my neighborhood. 

So I decided to no longer be vulnerable when I was about 9 years old. I decided I’d be how people apparently wanted me to be:  
Disconnected from myself an my feelings and violent to anyone who tries to come close or even annoyed me. 

I haven’t healed. I’m still fighting fear on a daily basis. So I’m never at ease and everything is hard and painful. Even concentrating and understanding what other people say gives me a lot of anxiety.

Because of this anxiety I will probably not react to this post anymore until everyone has forgotten about it. 

I’m sure other people pick up on my fear. 
I feel I’m still being judged for being afraid. 
Afraid of things the people that judge me have never dealt with and never will. They will never have to look back on a childhood full of violence and abuse but they will judge me just the same. 

But I wonder how many people notice my fear and insecurities and just use it against me. 
I feel that a lot of people do because everyone is afraid to a certain degree and putting someone down is just a way for some to keep their illusion of power. 

How can I know the difference between someone I can trust and someone I should stay away from?

How will I know if they don’t have a hidden agenda?

I know that I have trust issues because of how I was treated for as long as I can remember but how can I ever trust anyone again?

I wish I could trust people but I don’t.

"How do you deal with rage? Hi! First time poster here. For reference, I (21F) developed severe anxiety and depression when I was 19 (which also had some C-PTSD mixed in from being ostracized at school for years growing up), got put on the wrong drugs that made me suicidal, and was sent to a Christian inpatient mental health facility for seven weeks. The things that happened in that place are what really led to the development of full-blown PTSD, and especially as I’ve started therapy and started to fully grasp what happened, I can feel it kind of getting worse.

The hardest part for me right now is the anger. I used to be such a nice, friendly person who never got mad. Now it’s like any minor inconvenience sends me into full-blown rage. I feel like I can’t control my emotions anymore and I’m really scared that everyone around me will start hating me for it. I hate feeling this way, but I just can’t stop being angry.

"Guilt about not serving Hello, I just joined this group after a particularly rough morning. I don’t really know how to start so I’ll start with my background. 

I was abused as a child. I was isolated and given no choices. I knew this wasn’t normal but I didn’t have any resources or people who knew or could help me when I was little. In high school I became closer with a family friend who was a cop and a war veteran. He saved me from my household and provided a safe place and someone to talk to. At this point I didn’t know I had PTSD and didn’t know until last October. This man was my hero. I know the horrors of what he went through in Korea and stateside as a cop. 

In October I was in a car accident that left me with post concussion syndrome (PCS) and PTSD on top of a few other pre-existing things like depression and OCD. I’ve really been struggling and have been going to therapy since the accident. I was diagnosed with PTSD, but I feel so guilty for having it when what I went through doesn’t compare to serving in a war. I know some of what my mentor went through and my trauma does not compare to his or any of my other friends who have served. 

I’m so angry all the time, like I’m always ready to fight.   Little things set me off. I don’t want to do anything except stay at home. I feel like I don’t have a right to be feeling like this when I haven’t served, and it makes it worse. Has anyone else felt this way and does anyone have any advice?",ptsd,ptsd

"Its been so many years and I feel so stupid (NSFW and TW for s-x) When I was 17 I got into an LDR I didnt really want but I was very lonely like....this was my only friend. He groomed me from a teenager mental health fourn and he was 18. He visited me on his way to a Europe vacation and gave me my first kiss, I wanted to wait to kiss and he just forced it. He wanted a BJ so bad but I said no and he was so mad. We saw a play and he was just grumpy and mean. I went to visit him in his state and I loved his family but he would demand BJs. He asked if he needed to get condoms but I said I didnt want to have sex. I was on my period too so I think its why he didnt do more to me. I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said ""but think about how id feel"" and pushed me down. He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared. I went home and we broke up a few months later after he moved to Germany and I just set my relationship as with someone else to get him to leave me cause I kept trying but hed make me feel bad ( I was 18 and dumb...) 

I only told my twin but never my mom. She would NEVER understand.  I had another abusive bf this year (23 years old) and he was VERY misogynist. Like an incel. He hid it and it came out later on. He knew of my PTSD and all his rape jokes made me freak out and cry. He said the last time we fooled around he would cover my mouth and ignore me saying no and I freaked out idk why hed say that and I left a few weeks later. 

I now am seeing a new guy, but hes 100% diff than anyone. We were bffs. Hes sensitive, kind, funny, sweet, very dorky and very loving in his heart. He feels like the boy me. He is very sexually intelligent and patient. After my trauma at 18 I decided I want to wait till marriage so I never ever have to have sex with someone who I wouldn't regret. After my incel ex I feel it even more the way he changed and warped. My current bf knows this he knows everything and he is fine with it. His last ex they never had sex for their whole 5 years and he said he has dated many virgins and waited till they were ready. All his close friends say he truly is a great man. Hes a unicorn haha. 

I really want to fool around with him more but I am very scared Ill freak out. I cant masturbate without him and I feel like a WHORE doing it alone cause of my past. I just want to be normal. I want to just have happy sexual experiences with my bf. I know he can give me them the way he is but Im scared ill make them bad. I just want to be normal. Therapy is so slow and its such few and far between where I make milestones in anything at all!! How does this go away?! I manage my OCD, my anxiety is improving but PTSD never goes away. I hate it. I want to cry. I was only 18 why did me make me do all that stuff. I didnt want too. I feel like a disguting slut I want to punch my legs till they are black and blue. I hate myself for what I let happen to me and the fear it makes me have. My partner gets concerned to trigger me, hes very slow and patient when we discuss sex. Being a virgin I ask him questions and he never laughs at me like other people do he just explains stuff kindly and sweetly. No pressure no meanness. I feel like a dirty mean bad person. I want to talk to him but hes also stressed at work today and I feel so mean. My therapist is on vacation cause of Jewish holidays :(  idk..

"PTSD over neighbours downstairs Every few days the neighbours that live directly below me yell at each other for over 30+ minutes. I can hear the yelling through the duct/ventilation system. It triggers PTSD memories of my dad yelling at me as a child as he abused me, and makes me extremely sick and anxious.

I've filed a dozen complaints with the landlords over the last 6 months. I just phoned and filed another one 30 minutes and they said they'd go talk with them. I went downstairs to talk with landlords afterwards and he said ""Yeah, that isn't an issue, that's just how they talk"".

I said no it isn't, they yell at each other, my walks shake sometimes from them throwing things. He said ""If it's before 10pm we don't do anything about noise complaints.""

I said well I'm going to have to phone 911, as I've threatened to do in the past over this same issue. He said go ahead and basically he didn't care.

I phoned 911 and told them I was having a PTSD crisis from the people downstairs yelling multiple times a week. They instantly freaked out and the lady on the other end started yelling frantically at me.. ""Sir do we need to call an ambulance for you? Are you going to harm yourself?""... I said no, the issue with is with the people downstairs... She continued ""Sir, are you going to kill yourself?""... I Said please lower your voice and calm down, the 911 dispatcher was talking so loud and frenzied that it was making my anxiety worse. Finally of the same exchange back and forth over 10minutes I convinced her I wasn't in any harm, and if they could PLEASE just do something about the people that live below me.

I've been wanting to move out of this apartment for over a year but I live on disability and have no means of moving out, housing is so unaffordable and beyond my reach.

"Feel slightly more winded when exercising lately... problem? I'm 30, eat pretty well, thin, fairly normal blood pressure (120/80), and try to stay active. I have always told myself I didnt have a drinking problem because I can stop for 5 days without feeling any need to drink, and alcohol has never negatively affected my ability to do my job or caused me to act badly. I also rarely get hangovers for some reason. But I typically drink 4 strong beers on Friday and then spend Saturday and Sunday drinking from the late afternoon into the evening, probably 8 - 12 drinks each day. 

Recently, I feel a bit more fatigued when I'm exercising and it seems like I'm short of breath. I'm worried I have some form of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. What is the next step? Do I make an appointment directly with a cardiologist and tell them my concerns? I have cut back significantly over the last few weeks. Can cutting back to recommended levels (like 2-3 beers on weekends) reverse cardiomyopathy? 

Honestly, it sounds stupid, but it would be so embarrassing for me to need to quit drinking altogether, and I know quitting entirely is the healthiest choice, but I am fortunate enough to be able to cut myself off after a few drinks. I know not everyone is so lucky. ",alcoholism,alcoholism

"I made my psychiatrist smile today! Hi r/adhd, I'm kind of new here. I was finally officially diagnosed last month at 37 after a lifetime of struggling to just ""be normal"" and get my shit together.

When I first started seeing my psychiatrist five years ago, he immediately suspected that I had undiagnosed ADHD after hearing a few stories about my childhood. I was a textbook smart girl with ADD (it was the 80s-90s) and no one realized it because back then you couldn't have ADD unless you were a hyperactive boy.

We spent the last few years working to get my depression and anxiety under control, and at the beginning of this year I finally got to a place where I wasn't overwhelmed by negativity every single day. So I brought up the ADHD symptoms again and my doctor was happy to address it.

Exactly one month ago I walked out of my doctor's office with a Vyvanse prescription and my receipt had the medical code for ADHD-C on it. The Vyvanse gives me enough clarity and room in my brain to actually do things, like actually pay attention to my to-do lists and not procrastinate everything. I don't stare out the window for three minutes straight or scroll through Twitter endlessly.

I had my one month follow-up appointment today and I was able to tell my psychiatrist that I feel better than I have in years. That I can focus and I am improving my performance at work and my relationship at home. I finally feel like I'm OK. That's when I got the big smile.

"I bought a 95LX on ebay a few months ago and it's been more helpful than I anticipated So for those who don't know, the HP 95LX is an old Business class portable computer, AKA a palmtop that was released back in the 1990s. My reason for getting this was that I needed a graphics calculator for school last year and this just so happened to only cost $45, had said graphing functions I needed and I'm a nerd for old tech so I went ahead and bought one from the first reputable seller I saw on ebay.

The device itself is quite handy, and has inspired me to build a modernized version of the device. Aside from the calculator aspect of the device I've found it to be great for taking notes in class as my handwriting is atrocious, keep track of my school schedule and even my daily schedule and things I need to do.&lt;br /&gt;

Never attainable; i am unable

One line i rhyme what seems fateful.

But i am grateful for All that i have

Calling me back,

No longer appealing;

But i am longing for meaning and feeling.

Most of us have feelings that are unshakable

Dont let 'em take a toll and just run off

Returning whenever you want 'em to stop;

Grab 'em and ride them to places where thoughts

Become, before dying, something more than talk

Dont stop, go whenever You can

And

Dont be afraid to rest, and stretch your hands

And to help others too

But the best help for you

Is catch dreams for yourself

Go for it you sad fuck, there's nothing better to do. And that makes it your best thing to do.
You'll know when it comes, i think, and if you put your Soul's effort in it, itll turn out how its meant to go But kill yourself LATER, when/because you're ready, NOT because of pain and aimlessness.

Live just to be the most aimless cunt ever, if thats all youve got. Existence is half negative&amp;half positive, All is.

Your personal experience here?

IDK. You don't either, just remember its All 50/50, so at least try to enjoy half of it. If you dont enjoy any it, make something, do something, that others can enjoy or or be helped by, build on. Follow your real, pure destiny, whatever you know it is, as long as thatpath don't hurt anybeings/anybody. I know my life will hurt, have for a while, but i know that pain is worth enduring for the other half. I gotta make some good music.

Its my destiny, along with the other stuff, but Im GONNA DO ITt with my Mind, Body, and most importantly my Soul, and not have to worry because i WILL DO &amp; try, and some good WILL come from my Existence here, even if its external good and i bear most of the negative from my existence.

Peace out guys, try not to die because of pain. Die because you lived through more than you ever thought you

"Sent a message to my doctor telling her my Dexedrine dose wasn't strong enough, been very anxious My doctor has been wonderful so far, I went to her private clinic for an evaluation as I was already certain that I had ADHD and straight away from the get go admitted to her that I had used Vyvanse without a prescription and she still trusted me enough to prescribe it to me a couple weeks later when I received my diagnosis as I knew It already worked well for me.

Since I started Vyvanse I have been studying to pass some tests to go back to school full time and get a better job but the problem is that Vyvanse doesn't last long enough for me and since It gets rid of most of my social anxiety I didn't wanna have to take it later just to be able to study during the evening and so I was prescribed Dexedrine 5mg as a booster which I am supposed to take around 5pm around the time my Vyvanse stops working, when she prescribed Dexedrine to me she told me that It was something that was very easy to abuse and that she knew for a fact that people sold that on the streets and that for her to prescribe this to me she had to really trust me, she told me that maybe 5mg wouldn't be strong enough and to contact her in the case It isn't so she could change the 6 months prescription of Vyvanse/Dexedrine she already gave me, I started experimenting with it during the morning before taking my Vyvanse and I tried 2.5mg/5mg/7.5mg/10mg and I came to the conclusion that 10mg was the closest dose to my Vyvanse and that's what I needed to be able to study effectively and so I sent her a message yesterday explaining that to her which she still hasn't answered and I am kind of scared that she'll think I am seeking drugs and to lose everything because I really am not, It's been a really bad day so far and I can't stop thinking about it. The last times I messaged her I always received answers within a few hours the same day and her clinic is open today, I can't get the thought that she has read the message and that she thinks I am trying to get more dexedrine to sell or abuse out of my head! From what I am understanding 10mg isn't a high dose and is not something that is rarely prescribed, that's why I didn't initially think she might get suspicious, maybe she just didn't have the time to answer me yet and I'm just letting my anxiety take over me as usual, I really hope that's the case.
Fingers crossed. :(

"I have questions about medical detox Hello. My sister is married to an alcoholic who has been repeatedly dishonest with her. (Just for background: there are several alcoholics in my family, and my dad has been involved in AA for 30 years.)

My brother in law had alcohol withdrawal seizures 2 years ago, but he never stopped drinking. He is currently in a treatment center receiving a medical detox. He told my sister he was being released today. Then he called and said the doctor ""forgot to sign his release papers."" That sounds like a lie to me. 
Then he also said the doctor said he still had elevated enzyme levels. That sounds like the truth.

So, what does it mean to have elevated enzyme levels? Does this mean he is not done with withdrawal? Does this mean he has liver damage?  I can't find an answer with my Google skills, and my sister does not have access to his medical records. I would appreciate any help because my heart is breaking for my sister.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"[TW] Need some support Hey Reddit,

I really need some support right now.

Here are some things that have happened in the last 2 years:

&amp;#x200B;

* I got drugged and gang raped by strangers
* A university lecturer locked me in his office with him and threatened me
* My ex-boyfriend tried to murder me
* That same ex who I was in an absuive relationship for 5 years with has been harrassing / stalking me continuously since we broke up 4 years ago
* My dad died
* A guy on my university course spiked my drink with ketamine and sexually assulted me

Most of the time, I can handle it. But right now, I feel really overwhelemed.

I have a mountain of work to do, and I am worried about letting my teachers down when they have been so supportive and kind to me. 

I feel like a massive idiot for not being more on top of my work. Even though it feels like i'm working flat out most of the time.

My family mostly pretend that nothing has happened, and that I don't have ptsd. 

My boyfriend has been genuinly amazing. But he lives an hour away and I feel like i've already been really whiney about this stuff with him.

"Feeling quite depressed, my Mum's addiction is my responsibility. (Throwaway for obvious reasons) I'm writing this cause I'm in desperate need of help, I pray for a solution, or at the very least someone to talk to since I have nobody.

Fuck my life. I tried writing a story 6 times but I can't make it flow well so I'll just go for it and submit whatever I write now. I'm 17 year old, on my last year in the IB and I'm out to university. Since before I was born my Mum has used alcohol as a coping mechanism to deal with her problems. My Dad has tried pretty much everything to solve her addiction but she doesn't seem to want it to be solved so we're helpless. I have basically been ""tasked"" with dealing with her drinking problem and I've never done this before, I always used to ignore the arguments and everything by just hiding in my room preoccupying myself with video games. My sister used to be the one to interrogate her or try to cheer her up out of it while my Dad always threatens to leave her whenever she drinks which doesn't help cause it just makes her drink more. She's been in and out of drinking, sometimes not drinking at all for a few months and she always ends up back drinking since apparently ""nobody appreciates her effort"" even though she knows it should be expected of her to not drink. She seems like a much happier person when sober and I love her to death when she is, but she's just a fucking burden when she's drunk. I'm sorry to sound like an asshole but she makes EVERYTHING her problem. My dad has recently had a few heart issues and she was crying because it was HER burden to deal with - like what the fuck, my Dad is fine with it and has  gotten the correct medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway sorry for my blabbering, as you read I've been ""tasked"" to deal with her problem. What the hell do I do? I cannot just let her be like this because its a struggle living with her like this, she can't do any basic tasks and she's extremely clumsy. All she does in the day is cook and then lie in bed all day watching movies or going on social media - her way of escaping life, like me with video games.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? I've tried some of the things below:

Do I force myself upon her and take the wine away? (She usually has one by her side in her nightstand draw which you can't access because she's right there. She also has stashes of wine that I literally have to search the house up and down to find - behind curtains, behind cushions on the sofa, in the store room, literally anywhere).

Talk her out of it. She always ends up complaining about the same thing and it leads nowhere because ""everything is her fault"".

Ignore her, and tell her that I refuse to communicate with her unless she's sober.

Secretly take the wine away without confronting her?

"Is there any point to talk with a psychologist? Hello, I'd like to have some advice.

I'm a 17 year old boy. I have really good academic grades at school, I love to sport, I play guitar and I think I can do all the everyday things with ease.

But recently my friends and classmates started to discuss about the possibilities of me being autistic, because they think I have many tendencies that are related to autism. I had never thought about it before. I actually realized after that, that I truly am dumb af at real life situations and only smart at school related stuff. I decided to took some online autism tests and I got positive results. I also let one of my best friends took a test where she pretended to be me because I think she knows my personality better than myself (I'm having  a hard time understanding some of my problems) and in the end she got a even bigger result. I got a score of 37/50 myself on one of the tests and there was also stated that 80% of people, who get a score over 32, are autistic. This AQ-test was made by Simon Baron-Cohen, the link is \[here\]( [https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient](https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient) ) why i cant make a word into a link?

I talked about it with my mom and she told me that I was completely normal and this is all bullshit and that everyone can overthink and start to diagnose themselves with some shit according to the info they found by googling. And also told me to have an appointment with a psychologist if I don't believe her.

I may seem dumb but my question is that how even the psychologist could help me if decide to talk with her? So far I only have minor problems at life, like sometimes losing my stuff and being clumsy and also some communication problems.  Even if she confirms that I have a high functioning autism or something, is it worth the awkwardness to go to a talk?

He is extremely intelligent which is why I don’t understand why he is still in the 8th grade but that is not the problem. This is my first year teaching and I have a couple special needs children in my classes but this student concerns me the most. At the beginning of the year he was very excited for my class and contributed to the conversation when he was interested in the topic. Recently though, his parents moved to another city with the child’s siblings and left my student to live with his grandparents. As soon as this happened there was a noticeable difference in this child’s behavior; not eating, irritable, tells me he’s not sleeping, and had a couple outbursts toward not only students but teachers. One teacher asked for him to be removed from her class and now I have him for two subjects. His home life does not sound like it’s the best due to this abandonment. He is a lot bigger than me and stronger so when he has these aggressive outbursts it is quite scary for not only me, but the students. I don’t want to give up on him and I want to make school fun for him so if anyone has any advice on how to work to earn his trust I would really appreciate it. ",autism,autism

My wife of 11 years recently informed me that she wants to divorce. The primary reason is because of my drinking, I've since stopped altogether. She has, however; made up her mind that it's to late. I have in the course of our marriage chosen her over my family and friends I had no longer contact me. She posts things like ""taking the kids to Six Flags today, wish me luck"" and carries on as if nothing is amiss and other posts about how she has some hard choices, ""those who are close to me know what's going on"". Her friends offer solace and advice ""one day at time"" and ""hang in there it'll get better"" and similar encouragement. Meanwhile I am in such emotional pain that I don't know how I will ever recover from this. 
I know my use of alcohol has been the demise of my marriage. A marriage to a woman I am madly in love with. I have no one to blame for this demise but myself which is a primary contributor to my pain. Now, I'm past mid forties with nowhere to turn, no family and no friends with a crushed heart and immense emotional pain that I haven't a clue in how to deal with.

"I'm an aspie in the film industry and the Art of Autism published our article about movie characters who might be on the spectrum! https://the-art-of-autism.com/which-autistic-tv-movie-character-are-you/

I created a special Reddit account for this (My life is usually a perma-lurker, hence the name).

I'm producing on a project called Stella Incarnated and one of the main characters has Autism. What drew me to the project though is that it doesn't focus on the character's autism, but just treats him like a unique character of many in a story. I was born with Asperger's Syndrome and was taking special education classes even into college. But I would consider myself pretty ""normal"" these days as outwardly you wouldn't really know it. Normal for the film industry anyways. This is the first feature I've ever worked on that has dealt with a character on the spectrum so the project is personal to me.

Because we exist on the spectrum, we're all different in a number of ways... which makes representation of an Autistic character very hard. I even feel unqualified at times because I've been able to change myself to be reasonably outwardly normal!

So we wrote this article to talk about movie characters out there that we know are on the spectrum or who could be. We're passionate about bringing this project to life and we want people on the spectrum to weigh in. The answers we're asking for are a mix of doing something fun and hearing from regular people about how they see themselves in characters on screen. 

Side note: Even though the article says written by ""Stephen Gibler"" Avi and Vanessa wrote a ton and did a ton of work as well. Credit where credit is due.

"Antipsychotics/ Weight Gain Im very tired so please excuse how this post is written

"What is there to do in your free time? I want to start out by mentioning that I'm not entirely sure this is autism specific but I can't think of anywhere else to ask.  


So, I have aspergers, ADD and social anxiety (the anxiety is somewhat controllable as long as I don't have to do a speech and stuff like that) and I've come to the conclusion that my mind basically goes on autopilot when I play video games and it makes me not think about the things that I should think about, or want to think about. Just to name a few examples it's everything from planning what to do for dinner (I live alone) when or how much I should clean, just generally thinking ahead and or motivating myself to do things, or interact with people I actually do like etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel like I should either stop playing completely, or cut down the hours by **a lot,** but as I say that I realize that I have no idea what people do with themselves if they aren't playing games. I mean, when I visit family or friends I can watch stuff on the tv that doesn't really interest me but we usually chat while we do that so it's not really that much in focus. and I just can't make myself mindlessly watch stuff on tv anymore (used to watch tv pretty much all day everyday as a kid) and/or sit on the couch and browse on my phone.

Like many people with autism I kinda lack the imagination to think of new things to do as I simply just can't imagine the possibilities, and the few things I can think of is very lackluster. Like I want to be able to draw, and so I try to draw something (also struggling to come up with things to draw) and it tires me out pretty good but then that 'desire' to draw is extinguished for a while (either that or I get frustrated because I just can't do it proper).  


Then there's playing guitar, I'm pretty good at that but playing the same 15 songs for 12 years is tiring and I can't find any new songs that fits me, as in I either don't like the song that much or find it too easy to be ""worth"" it. and if I can't find something new to learn it frustrates me as well and I end up losing interest for a while again.  


(after a bunch of google searches this one seems to be popular) exercising, it seems like a go-to but my first thought is... ""Ok but what then? you do your exercises and is a little physically active for an hour (or a few) but what then? you can't be doing it all day every day, at least not at first and I really don't want to spend all my time on it so it just leaves the big gap of what to do alongside with being physically exhausted and not wanting to do anything because of it""

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's reading books, I've (somewhat) recently started reading Lord of the rings, albeit it's been a while since I last read because of a new game release it is the first time I've ever been able to sit down and read a book. **But** with lotr, while I do like the story and the setting etc, it also sparks my desire to play games where you can ""experience it yourself"" - there's other books than fictional (or just that setting in general) of course but I have no idea what it would be as my imagination once again leaves me hanging. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if you've made it through this rant, or manifest of my lacking imagination, what else is there to do? I can't do something simply to pass time, it has to have a clear purpose or a kind of guideline to go along with it - like an example from a course I took about autism, one of the other people there said (after being suggested to go for a walk); ""you don't just do that. You don't go outside and wander around aimlessly. Why would you do that? it makes no sense"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree as I would just end up with no idea what to do and then go home. That being said, I do go for walks occasionally but I have to plan out the route in my head before I go and it is generally to get some fresh air/get the blood flow going.. And mostly in fall and winter because I am very sound sensitive and having bumblebees, bees and wasps fly around my head is incredibly exhausting (as I can't tell what it is but it's fast, **very** loud, to me at least, and so I'm always on guard as I don't know if I'm allergic to wasp stings or not) I'm gonna keep adding stuff to this if I don't just cut it here, already been in the making for like an hour, so that's all.

"Use your phone so much that it gets in the way of doing homework? Here's a way that I just found that prevents phone usage and makes sure you won't use it. (This only works if you don't have YouTube Red, btw)

1. Connect to a bluetooth speaker.

2. Give it to someone who's in the house and is willing to help you.

3. Play white noise (white noise helps me a lot, which is why I choose this method instead of just putting the phone in another room) or whatever you want through it ON YOUTUBE.

"My life. I thought I would share my story a little bit. I was diagnosed with autism at a very young age. I ended up staying back in first grade, but I wouldn't change it for the world because I met so many amazing people. School was tough for me and I got bullied and had a really rough patch. But I didn't let it stop me. Elementary and middle school went really well and then I hit high school. I was really close to failing freshman year, but I turned myself around. This was when I had my rough patch but I picked myself back up. I got really into writing, so I started writing my own stories. One of my favorite YouTubers read one of them actually. I had a lot of amazing high school achievements. I got an award for improving in my chemistry class in my junior year and I made the honor roll quite a bit after my freshman year dilemma. In my senior year, I didn't decide on colleges so I go to community college right now. Another amazing decision. I'm able to decide what I want to do with my future.",autism,autism

"I'm having trouble with dehydration despite (more than) ample water intake. The course of medication is otherwise extremely successful. What remedies/supplementation have you used to counteract this? Hey all. I'm happy to say that after 5-6 years of guidance from my primary care, some trial and error with medications and a touch of discipline that I consider myself an ADD/ADHD success story. I encourage anyone that believes they may have ADD/ADHD to speak to their doctor about it. 

On to the topic (and inb4 drink more water). I consciously and purposefully drink 1 gallon of water per day during business hours.  My job is in sales and therefore minimally physically demanding at best. Outside of work, I wouldn't be surprised if I drank another .25-.5 gallons each day. Despite this, I regularly feel dehydrated. I'll readily admit that I drink 2 cups of coffee each morning and have no intention of stopping as it isn't excessive by most standards and it's something simple that I enjoy and look forward to. 

The question- Has anyone tried supplementing with electrolyte packs / tablets to counteract this and found success? If so, what brands, what dosage, what frequency, etc? (I realize that dosage and frequency largely depend on the person/body type, just trying to get a feel)

Thanks everyone. I hope you all find a way to make focus and productivity the least of your concerns.

She follows these books instructions to a T, including giving him camels milk and removing any kind of aluminum seltzer cans from the house. So ok? I was fine with this at first because it seems harmless. But now she’s talking about not vaccinating the kid any longer and I just can’t get on board with that. I also truly believe this pseudoscience is preventing them from enrolling him in ABA or some other kind of therapy which I know will benefit him and help him be the best version of himself that he can be. They think that they are going to cure him through diet, so why need therapy in the meantime?

I come to reality right away, but not after my body tries to ""rescue"" me or startle. Some things get better with therapy but there are always scars. I thought the EMDR would get rid of this but it hasn't. I'm learning to accept that maybe fireworks just won't be something I can ever be comfortable around or enjoy again. Maybe that's ok.

"The lies I tell (and hate myself for telling) There are many circumstances where I feel like I have to tell small lies because understanding the truth would require a deep understanding of ADHD, which most people don't have. 

I hate this. Integrity and truthfulness are really important to me, and I don't lie about important things. But telling these little lies makes me hate myself. 

Here are some examples:

&amp;nbsp;


*""Sorry I'm late, I hit some traffic.""*

True version: ""Sorry I'm late, I was reading every single Wikipedia article about medieval undergarments.""

&amp;nbsp;

*""Sorry I didn't call you back, I was having phone problems.""*

True version: ""Sorry I didn't call you back, I was feeling too shitty about myself to talk to anybody and sort of felt like you'd see through the phone that I hadn't showered in two days and was sitting in a pile of laundry, and then by the time I was ready for human contact again, I felt too guilty about not having called you back sooner, so I avoided you.""


&amp;nbsp;

*(When someone asks ""What did you do this weekend?"") ""Oh, you know, just relaxed.""*

True version: ""I sat on my couch and read the internet until my eyes hurt, while part of my brain kept pleading with me to get up and go outside or at least wash the dishes. I couldn't seem to do anything I wanted or needed to do, so I just kept on clicking and feeling miserable.""

&amp;nbsp;

You just can't say these things to people you don't know really well. It would make them really uncomfortable at best, or make them think you're pathetic or crazy at worst. So what can you do but lie? But lying feels horrible.

"Help with an undiagnosed child Hi all. This is a bit odd, and fairly difficult to explain.

I'm involved with a small agricultural community with focuses on off grid living and community. We have a total of 30 houses, and everyone basically lives together as a village and help each other with children and general day to day things.

Now, I do live in a third world country. Some conditions are just... ignored or not known of. There is ignorance and tribalist medicine, witch doctors basically and a terrible public health system.

Now, one of the couples who live here have a son,  and I believe he may have a condition that is unrecognised and untreated. I can't accurately state what may be causing him difficulty. 

I've been trying to spend some more time with him, but I HAVEN'T told the parents that I'm concerned about their son, and I'm having trepidations about discussing this all with them without having an idea what's happening or how I can help.

He is roughly 8 years old, 1m tall, and at a real guess maybe 30-40 kg.
Jnr has trouble standing upright, and always stands slightly bent over with his arms in a ""T-rex"" position, he struggles to lift his neck up straight and has to lift it side ways to look up. He some some problems walking, with it being more of a shuffle. We played a lawn game the other day, one of those that has a tennis ball on a string, and while his coordination is utterly terrible, he did attempt and get it right to hit the ball nicely when I held it in his ""Strike zone"". 

He doesn't vocalise words properly, and doesn't speak any English (while not completely odd, some English is expected). He responds to a few phrases in his home language, but I'm far from fluent in Chichewa which makes it difficult to find out more. I would ask ""How are you?"", and he'd parrot the second part of the phrase back to me until we start an activity or I hand him something.

He will zone out at things, then swing his body and loudly give out a string of sounds, much like my 1 year old does, and he's fascinated with playing with imaginary cars and such, although he mainly has rocks and such for toys.

The other kids make time for him, but treat him akin to a toddler and don't really include him in the ""older kid games"".


Now. The first question is. Do I mind my own business or do I try and help? My wife is a preschool teacher/special needs caregiver, and agrees with me that JNR is defiantly struggling with... something. We want to help, but we don't want to insult anyone or overstep our places.

Secondly, is there activities I could do with JNR that he may enjoy more? I get a long with him, but he's super shy and doesn't really know how to voice his desires.

Thirdly, should I purchase anything for him or his parents to help with this? 

Fourthly, and the main reason I'm here, how would I go about helping JNR live a better, more adapted life? How would I go about getting him help, or due to all of our monetary issues, how could his parents and us help JNR more effectively?

I am not really able to work all the time because I have a full-time job and two other part time jobs. In my free time, I like to spend more and more time on internet games and to keep my eyes on social media. My work schedule is pretty much like this: 1-6AM, 5-10PM, 1-6AM, 8PM. My daily schedule gives me more free time, because I can spend it on work when it suits me. I usually sleep between 9PM and 3AM, but I've seen people that spend 20-30 hours there.

3. My expenses are a combination of rent, electricity, phone, food and internet. I don't really spend enough time on anything else these days.. I do enjoy the brief breaks wherein I have a little extra spending money. 

One of those spending money moments is when my son says ""Mom, I want to play football with mom,"" and I say ""That's cool. What do you want to do?""

I think it's been very beneficial to them, and I'm very glad they decided to let me use weed for something other than their parents' pot, rather than their parents' weed. But it hasn't led to anything bad. I've not gotten in trouble, I have not broken the law, I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything you understand, please my children do know what it takes to stay strong as well as fearful. It takes my own resolve you know",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"Post Rehab: Medication Side Effects Question for Anxiety/Depression All, to make this short and sweet, I’ve been sober and happy for the first time in a long time. I finally am opening up to all the possibilities of continuing this mindset for as long as I can, but I am still very new to this world and so is my family. So here’s my question about one of my ongoing issues:

As part of my treatment program, I have been prescribed Prozac, Antabuse, Bisuprone and Visatril (An antihistamine for the anxiety spikes as needed). 

I’ve been compliant with all of these and have kept a good schedule on taking them as prescribed, all except for the Visatril. I took more than prescribed and over the span of a week until two nights ago, where I developed seizure like episodes which I can not control. 

These ‘seizures’ last for a second or so, where I lose control of my body for that time. It’s an overwhelming feeling and I’ve dropped my phone quite a bit during these instances. It’s been two days since I’ve taken the Visatril and the symptoms still persist. I am 22, and this will be close to my 16th day sober. Anyone have any insight as to why the symptoms still persist? Or if they are even considered seizures?",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Only just occurred to me that I have PTSD An abusive room mate made it difficult for me to ever be certain of anything.

Then pile that on top of a job that I relocated my life for only to be made redundant 3 months into it. All the while during those 3 months I shyed away from getting to close to anyone or the job because I was afraid I'd lose it... And then I did.

Got another job and I left that because I feared it happening again.

And then was fired from the job after that because the manager reminded me too much of my abusive housemate... She wasn't even close to her but any time I received the lightest bit of negative feedback I sort of... Lose focus... Like the whole world muffled out.

Every day at that job just became a fear for my job. A constant distracting fear of losing it and not feeling like I even deserved to be there.

I've got a new job now. They're telling me I'm doing a great job. Not a single negative thing said... So much as a bit of criticism thought and it's almost like everything shifts... I just shut down and beg for the peace of death... Over a fucking meeting!?",ptsd,ptsd

"DAE feels like their autism ""worsened"" over time? Hi, it's my first time posting here, but with a question that is in my mind for quite some time now. 

I've been diagnosed to be on the spectrum when I was a child (around 8 or 9), and now I am 21. In this time, I feel like my autism got worse (I only use the word worse because I lack the English vocabulary to find a better fitting one, I'm sorry) over time; especially since I went to therapy to treat my depression and anxiety issues when I was around 18. 

But now I feel like I'm much ""more"" autistic than when I was younger/a teenager - or could that be a misleading feeling, since I know which other mental illnesses plague me and I can differentiate them better than before? Or is that just a somewhat normal thing, that you get more aware of the ticks and stuff you have, when you get older? 

I definatly cry more over things that I can't do/feel weird/feel misunderstood than when I was younger, and also I feel like I have a lot more barriers in my mind to do certain things (for example: I once had to pick out some lemons out of a bowl when I visited my mom, but it was like that weird barrier thing in the video game Detroit: become human when I tried to reach into the small opening of said bowl - I just couldn't move my hand behind it and in the end I just started crying and stood there for a few minutes, until my mother came and asked me what's wrong) or that maintaining eye contact is now a lot more harder for me than when I was a teenager. 

So my question is: is that considered ""normal"" or do you think that maybe some other factors may have influenced this? Could it be that I only now experience these things like this because in the past, after my diagnosis, my mom always said that I wasn't autistic or even on the spectrum and only now came to accept that her child indeed does have autism? 

I'd really like to hear your thoughts on this. Thank you all in advance. ",autism,autism

"Yesterday I managed to humiliate myself, lose the respect of my mentors, and jeopardize my job and education. I'm freaking out   

Hi. I also posted this on r/stopdrinking for more support. I’m sorry if this is long or irrelevant, but I have been having a panic attack over this for the last 8 hours and I Really need to hear/talk to people who have also been close to destroying their lives with stupid alcohol. 

For background, I am a graduate teaching assistant for the summer and also work in a research lab. 

Unfortunately, one thing that is really freaking me out is that this is my second strike. My boss for my lab pulled me aside about 4 months ago to comment that he feels alcohol has been heavily affecting my productivity and that he can smell it on me sometimes (note that he is a very strict man who is also a Mormon. I’m kind of afraid of him). He told me that I needed to see the school substance abuse counselor. I complied, and the councilor recommended me for intensive outpatient therapy and gave me a number. Honestly, I completely blew it off. I didn’t understand how my health insurance worked and didn’t feel like figuring it out. However, the topic never came up again, and I ceased having a morning beer before I went in. 

Currently I am TAing a late morning lab. Tuesday night I had WAY WAY too much to drink (first time I’ve vomited from alcohol in almost a decade). I woke up in time for my class (Definitely still probably kind of drunk), and went in. I was admittedly pretty useless as again, really hungover and probably still kind of drunk, but I thought I made it through pretty okay.  

Today, the chair of my department pulled me aside and asked to speak with me after my lab. When I did, she mentioned that she had concerns- someone (no idea who) had raised concerns that I might have a neurological issue because I was stumbling. She then told me that she had called my lab boss to express concern, and he told her about our previously conversation. She expressed to me that she is concerned about me, and that I need to be more responsible and to please just call in next time. 

Needless to say I was pretty frazzled by all of this, which is where I maybe fucked up and could have saved things? The thing is, I did/do have a neurological disease. In my early 20s I went about a year where I couldn’t walk without heavy assistance, and then spent the next several years with a pretty severe limp. I’m basically recovered, but I never regained all of my balance. Stone cold sober and not tired it isn’t a huge deal and isn’t really noticeable- I kind of sway a bit, I definitely trip, crash into things more than normal people, and don’t always walk in a straight line (I was in addiction treatment for a DUI right around the time that I was diagnosed with this disease, and it took a crazy amount of convincing, including being breathalyzed and drug tested, to convince the councilors I wasn’t inebriated). I also lean on things and stand in a certain way to minimize falling over.  When I’m drunk, hungover, sick, whatever it gets way way worse. I thought I was doing pretty okay yesterday, but I Wasn’t concentrating on it nearly as much as I would, so I was stumbling more. I SHOULD have disclosed this to the chair. I really should have, but a mixture of me hating talking about it (I was told I would never walk again) and being totally blindsided, it didn’t really cross my mind. 

Anyway, I apologized profusely for my unprofessionalism and assured her it wouldn’t happen again. Within two hours of our meeting I had figured out my healthcare insurance and had an appointment with a therapist for their earliest possible appointment. I then emailed the chair to apologize again and let her know that I was taking appropriate action to remedy the situation. 

I’m kind of considering telling her about my disease tomorrow, but at this point I worry it may look like I’m making excuses, PLUS I want to talk about this as little as possible. 

What I’m now super concerned about is my boss. Again, this is my second strike with him and he is also very image conscious (he likes that his is the most prestigious lab). He is on vacation until next week, so I have like a week to stew over this. I don’t THINK he will fire me, but I have definitely lost a lot of his trust so that doesn’t bode well. Either way it is going to be a very uncomfortable and painful talk as he really is the ‘lecturing’ type. 

So, there you go. I’m freaking out. In 1 hour I managed to apparently humiliate myself, lose the respect of three of my mentors, and put my job and education at risk. 

This is all still very fresh, but I don’t know what else I can do. 

Thank you for listening. It helped a lot just to type it out.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Not ""feeling it""? Sorry for posting so much. I had a question for you all. 

I've been trying to reflect on my trauma and be aware of what happened to me. That said, sometimes I forget things and remember them randomly later. Atop that, I have not cried about my situation. I have not stopped and felt any type of sadness about it, and I really wish I could. When I'm exposed to triggers, I feel anxiety and even have panic attacks (nausea, shaking, sweating, crying, etc). But, aside from that, I feel really really numb. 

Does anyone else relate? I want to feel sadness or anger or *something* so I can process it and decrease my anxiety. I've tried so hard, and I just can't. This has been weighing on me for so long. Anyone have any tips on how to ""feel"" and accept the emotional damage associated with trauma? I need to not be numb anymore :/

I think I'm more afraid of them not believing me than I am of asking for help.

"I needed a little help with household items last week and posted r/assistance. I was helped, but then a cruel parody of my autistic son's sweet list he made for me was posted on a sub called r/radomactsofgreed Have a look at the screen shots and stuff. It will make a lot more sense then. My son wrote the Amazon Wish List called ' Ma's Clothes Hope List' because he's just a sweetheart. 

On r/radomactsofgreed, they're making fun of him, especially u/orangeapplez. They are laughing and saying it is made up, like just because he's autistic, he's too stupid to write this lovely list?

 I can't let him know about this, he'll be crushed. but the worst part is, my son was self conscious and had the list set on Private; how did these people see the list my son wrote?? 

I'm scared to death. My son is autistic. They say that these people, especially u/orangeapplez and u/mycello, will stalk you, doxx you, send the FBI to your house..

"Angry with people’s reaction to PTSD I have PTSD, I was diagnosed 2.5 years ago in the midst of a severe mental breakdown. I fought the fight of my life on a daily basis to get to where I am now, an amazing place where I function normally 95% of the time. During this war against my brain my body shut down in essentially every way possible, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t work the job that I love, I couldn’t open my curtains, I had alarms on every external and internal door in my apartment which I tested every few minutes, I slept maybe 2 hours every third night, I couldn’t walk to my car or take the trash out without a paranoid panic attack, nor could I travel in a vehicle with a window down, or a vehicle at night. I had hallucinations, flashbacks, dissociative episodes, I broke in the way that we all know far too well. This illness broke my heart, it shattered it into a million pieces. I didn’t recognize myself, I cry every time I remember how it felt to be so painfully out of control of my own mind and body, to be unable to stop those feelings. So why, why the heck, do people think it is okay to minimize my experience and treat me like an overdramatic attention seeker because my PTSD comes from non-combat events? Am I wrong for being filled with rage at the dismissal? Not just for my sake, but for the sake of every survivor and work-in-progress out there. How do you deal with this? What are some effective ways to spread awareness of real range of this disorder?

"Should I reach out? I met my ex almost two decades ago. He was an absolute force of nature, and I fell hard and fast for him. There were red flags, but I didn't really see them because it was better than anything I was used to. He had been diagnosed with depression, and it really weighed down on him so he turned to alcohol. It was mostly okay, but confrontations would occur like twice a year. His drinking and behavior spiraled out of control, culminating in him cheating. I pushed him to get help, and it seemed like it was really making a difference, but he had to discontinue treatment for a variety of reasons. He ended up being worse than ever, cheated again, then moved out of the house we just bought.

&amp;#x200B;

Drinking was always a point of contention for us, and he engaged in some pretty toxic behaviors. He has insisted since he left that he doesn't drink a lot, but I've seen evidence that suggests otherwise.  After a pretty egregious act about a month ago, I finally told him I can't talk to him anymore. I'm not trying to get him back, but his family is pretty unsupportive. I am so scared that something bad will happen to him, and I feel so powerless.   


Should I reach out to him? Tell him that, while I can't maintain a friendship with him, I'll be there for him if he needs me? My number one fear has always been him finally drinking himself to death, and I know I can't think about this logically. I am terrified, and I can't even begin to fathom how I am supposed to handle this.  ",alcoholism,alcoholism

"So Fucking Tired I was let go from my job today for attendance. I haven't been able to sleep, so I've missed alot of work. It's taken me more than a year being on an ""emergency referral"" to be able to get in to a provider that specializes in PTSD. In the meantime I've gone through five medications for sleep and I have been avoiding triggers and have basically become a hermit crab, holed up in my apartment.

Does it ever get any better? I finally was approved for a medical card for marijuana for sleep - our state just recently passed the bill. It's worked for me in the past, but I haven't had consistent and regular access to it before to make a difference. 

Long story short I got into it with my drill sergeant in basic training, told on him to our commander, and was retaliated against. I was in for 5ish months, and was discharged from the army under general conditions. I'm not eligible for VA benefits, and I feel like a piece of shit trying to go to vet groups or meetings because I was only in basic and didn't see combat. Plus, I am ashamed that I told someone about my incident because ""What happens in the platoon, stays in the platoon"" and if I could have done it differently, I would have kept my mouth shut.

So I was let go from my job today, and because I feel like telling people about this stuff makes them look at me like I am broken and not a human being, I don't  share anymore. I've tried reaching out to friends, but it feels like they think I am looking for a hook-up or something when I am literally looking for a couch to sleep on so I don't feel alone and can get some actual sleep.

So instead I went to our local strip club and over drafted my account $200 to get hugs to not feel alone.

The good news is that because I was fired today, at least I have insurance until the end of August so I have the opportunity to see my psychologist 2-3 more times.

"PTSD from drug use? I’ve never posted here before so I’m not sure how to warn anyone beforehand, but I don’t want anyone to get triggered by this post so please be careful.

About a year ago I had a terrible LSD trip. It started off fine, but a few hours later I was still hallucinating heavily. I had tripped before and it was never this intense. I had the worst fear, anxiety, and paranoia I’ve ever experienced in my life. I was so scared my friends and I would get caught, which when I think about it now wouldn’t have been so horrible, but in my mind it was. For about 3 days after that I had terrible anxiety, but I was glad that it was over.

A few days later I ended up taking mdma which also gave me terrible fear and anxiety. 

About a month after all this, I was doing okay, but then I smoked weed with some friends and got to high, and had what felt like a flashback to the acid trip. I was so terrified and after that, I got depersonalization. 

Now, whenever I hear a song or see a picture from around that time, I panic. I start hearing my heartbeat, I start shaking, I start sweating, and I just can’t calm down. It’s the worst thing ever. 

I’m not diagnosed with ptsd because last time I told my psychiatrist about my drug use he ridiculed me, and I just wanted to avoid that. Is it possible to even get PTSD from something like this?

"I had a new traumatic experience that set me way back in my recovery.

"How to tell a person you started dating about your triggers? Hello all,

After doing my research on Google, I decided to post here since I am hoping to find someone with a similar experience who could give me some good tips for what I am going through right now.

My PTSD is related to a relationship I had couple years ago and is associated with violence, anger and disrespect that I faced at the very beginning of the relationship with my partner at that time.

I did not know about my PTSD for several years and only found out why exactly I struggled with certain things (especially physical part of my following relationship) last year. At that time, I was with a long-term partner - our communication and trust was well developed so sharing this with him and developing coping strategies was quite manageable (although not completely easy as I was still trying to make sense of everything and had to go back to my past experience)

I recently started dating a new person and unfortunately, since my trauma happened right at the beginning of the other relationship, I find myself easily triggered (sometimes by suggestion of being alone somewhere with the guy, sometimes by specific touches). I know that with time, and trust that will hopefully develop between us, they will tend to affect me less but in the meantime, it is truly hard to hide my fear, not to snap... and explain it somehow. And for the other person not to take it personally, thinking they are doing something wrong or that I am scared of them.

Lot of websites recommend to wait couple of months before telling your new partner but that will not likely work out for me as it is getting in the way now... If you have experience with this, is there anything that helped you when you start reliving the trauma? I wish I could control my physical response but my body just reacts on its own trying to protect itself (becoming jumpy, pushing the person away..) Or would you just go ahead, even so early in the dating stage and try to explain? If I decide to do so, I will most likely not share details but then, I actually do not even know what to say.

I just feel like the most beautiful part of relationships is now ruined for me and I find it difficult to even ask my friends what they would do. 

Thank you for any experience you might want to share! Sending a lot of love to all of you.",ptsd,ptsd
"Short sleep waking early - methylphenidate - autism with add symptoms Hello everyone,

A couple of weeks ago I started with methylphenidate and my sleep pattern changed a lot but I don't know if I should worry about it.

Before medication I would need around 9.50 hours of sleep. On some days when I did not get a full 9.50, even if it was just 15 minutes less, I would get sleep deprivation and be grumpy and tired all day. 

Now I wake up around 6.30 am every day, no matter what time I go to sleep. When I wake up, I am awake and I just want to get out of bed, start the day, do something. I fall asleep within 20/30 minutes and sleep really, really deep. Nothing seems to wake me, not even the dog barking one night.

Yesterday I got 8 hours of sleep, my body seemed to be a little bit tired, I had wet eyes and I yawned a lot for a couple of minutes, but mentally I was refreshed like I slept for around 10 hours.

I don’t want to trigger her or have her have the guilt of me suffering because of her, or remind her at all of that time while she’s doing so good, and probably won’t go back to therapy unless it gets bad again.

She has me on 20mg XR 1x daily(My old psych doc had me on 30mg IR 1x daily and a 10mg booster dose later in the day) which worked much better than the XR. I feel like the XR is a roller coaster ride that makes my anxiety worse and seems ineffective. 

I want to request the change from XR to IR form but feel like she will judge me for asking for some reason. Do you have any advice on how to handle this situation? I get extremely nervous when requesting anything from people(I don't understand why) ",adhd,adhd

"Good books/articles for ADHD people about how to succeed? Hello friends! 

So I’m in college, 21, and have been diagnosed with ADHD (predominantly inattentive, so technically ADD) for about a year now. I’ve been taking meds during that time and it’s wonderful to help me be able to focus. 


I still have a few issues though. The fact that I can focus now is wonderful! However getting focused on something that doesn’t interest me is extremely difficult. Making that first sometimes seems impossible. So, my room, car, life, is basically still a disorganized mess.

Along with that, I’ve got the self confidence and the large fear of rejection/failure issues as well. I’ve thought for a long time that that just the way I am, until after reading a few articles I realized that these issues often occur in people with ADHD.



 I know I should probably try to see a therapist to help with that but it’s just not affordable for me right now.

So, I want to know if anyone has good suggestions for how ADHD people can deal with these problems? I dunno, I just need something to help me work on my thought processes.

I’m tired of constantly being a mess. I’m tired of irrationally thinking people dislike/hate/are mad at me. I’m tired of feeling I’m a huge fat failure at everything I do. (I rationally know that I’m not, but I still feel that way)

"Eating Disorder and Gastroparesis? pls help! So I clearly suffered from mental health issues from around Feb 2019 to April 2019. I guess to be as technical as possible on and off I would severely restrict my caloric intake. Eating a few snacky type foods here and there. I did not attempt to purge but I suffered from depression and paranoia most likely no official dx.

Anyways since I came home towards end of April 2019 ( I was studying in another province (Canadian). I started to eat a lot more like half a large pizza and 10 chicken wings etc and would feel generally ok.

But since mid june i have symptoms of nausea and low appetite and early satiety. lots of tests have been done everything coming back normal. I have yet to get a Gastric emptying study. 

What I want to ask is if my eating patterns from Feb 2019 to April 2019 could have triggered what I am experiencing now? or was that too short a period of time and what I have felt since mid June could be a viral gut infection or something else?

"Having trouble coping with anger/anxiety/thoughts I’ve been struggling with PTS for a few years due to my former work. Last year I was finally diagnosed when I decided to talk to a psychologist about it. I go to therapy every week and group counseling. I see my psychologist about 2x a month. I’m currently on Trazedone for insomnia and Ativan (lorazepam) for anxiety. The Ativan I try not to take too often because it’s highly addictive. 

I’m having issues lately with intrusive thoughts and anxiety. The thoughts come back and I sort of get into this deep hole where it’s hard to get out of. I feel violent rage for no reason at all. It’s having an affect on my life every day and it really has a negative affect when I’m out with my friends and the thoughts come in. I don’t really know how to describe how I feel when it happens, but it just feels *bad*, and there’s nothing I can do but just go about my day as best I can until my mind gets off it, but it never really goes away. 

I plan on bringing this up to my therapist and psych next time I see them. It just hasnt been this bad, ever. Are meds (besides Ativan) the next step for me?",ptsd,ptsd

Beyond that it seems his responses are all trained responses. He has echolalia, so he just repeats questions rather than answering them.

i just thought that for once, she'd give me some unconditional support instead of telling me that she's tired of my issues and i should just get over it like an adult. at times like this i feel like my ed/depression/whatever else isn't even real because i could feel worse and i don't even know why i'm doing this anymore. back when i was a lot younger i'd wait around for her and wouldn't eat until she came home because it felt like it wasn't worth it alone, and now i don't have anyone like that so it's easier not to sometimes.

"The unlucky ones I found out yesterday one of my brother’s best friends is probably homeless. He is a great guy. The type who would gladly give you the shirt off his back. But alcoholism sunk in its claws and his life has slowly spiraled out of control since. One of my best friends from college is also fully an alcoholic. He has been able to maintain his professional life but his personal life is in shambles. His girlfriend even died of alcohol poisoning a few years back. The other brother one of groomsman in his wedding is also suffering from alcoholism. He had so much potential (had a full ride)but now his personal and professional life are a wreck.

It seems so strange. In college all of us were hard boozing. All 3 of us brothers and all our friends had atrocious drinking habits. Yet the lot of us are doing well to very well. In our early to late 30s virtually all of all three groups are middle to upper middle class. Most have a spouse. Many have kids. Basically life is going pretty well for everyone except the 3 unlucky guys who turned into alcoholics. Looking back there wasn’t any obvious sign that these 3 were destined for alcoholism. The one guy I would have predicted would end up an alcoholic went to rehab in his mid 20s and is doing well now.

"First time in six years that I've actually organised something for my wife's birthday! I have been married for about six years, and every year, my wife's birthday would roll around, and every year I would completely forget until the last minute (the day before - disaster).

This year I have been diagnosed with ADHD-PI and recently started meds. So this year is the first year where I have amazingly planned ahead for her birthday, and the date hasn't magically snuck up on me out of nowhere. 

I actually was able to organise money and buy thoughtful presents ahead of time. And even organise a meal and decorations for the day! (It wasn't ""perfect"", but a massive improvement)

It certainly wasn't to the level she deserves, and I have a long way to go in actually doing a decent birthday. But this is the first time I've been able to manage it! 

It had been a real strain on our relationship. So this is huge that I was able to do it. 

The medication really helps me with clarity of mind, and reduces the effort required to take action. Also helps with being less distracted, so that I can actually plan things. 

It's not to say it didn't take a whole lot of bloody hard work! But I had the edge to actually make it possible!

I made large use of Google calendar and to-do lists, to remember, and plan what I was going to do. There's no way I could just do it all in my mind. I have to externalise as much of my executive function as possible. 

TL:DR - First year actually remembering and organising birthday for my wife. Accepting and working within a diagnosis, and with the help of meds, made it possible. There is hope!

If a person with a severe psychosis disorder is left isolated and untreated, can the disconnect from reality become so bad that they see and think of everything completely different?

"My Days Are Actually Productive Hi all, I’m super new but I just wanted to stop here and share a happy story.

I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months back, and now that I’m on medication, it’s been a life changer.

Before: Laying around, thinking about doing homework but not doing homework, on reddit 78 hours at a time, no schedule, scrolling through social media hours at a time, forgetting to eat, staring into space and losing so much time, being so completely and utterly disorganized that I never knew where anything was so I couldn’t study, couldn’t complete homework, got horrible grades. Watched everyone leave the exam room and feeling incredibly intimidated that I was still on the first page because I had to reread the questions forty times. Just ok sex because I was always elsewhere.

Now: I WANT to study. I know I need to get out of bed and I DO. I know HOW to study for tests, and I got a 94 on my physiology exam and a 90 on my economics exam, and that is outrageously different than the Ds I got last semester. I can take notes AND listen to the professor at the same time, AND remember most of it. I don’t think I’ve ever actively learned before, and it feels so good. As someone who for years believed she was a lazy sack of goo with bad anxiety and depression and would never become the doctor she wanted to be, feeling this way is just...phenomenal.

Seeing how far I’ve come in the last 6 months has been breathtaking. I still have lots of problems to work out, but I’ve found the motivation to stick with this and get better :)

"Coming off benzos, short term. Worrying about symptoms So my mother is undiagnosed schizophrenic. Being raised by here (only part time, since parents were divorced) has made me hyper aware to this illness.

I started benzos for my anxiety. I have always had anxiety, and ocd, ocd is more O than Compulsive. I don’t really have depression, although the fact I am now trying to taper off benzos had led me to a negative overall thought.

My mother got brought up during my last doctors visit, and that ramps my ocd up about developing schizo type properties. I know the rate is still low, but I did devolp anxiety like she had.

She is definitely a paranoid schizophrenic, growing up she would think everyone was against her, I remember her driving me around in the car and pointing at a star saying it’s following her. the most recent interaction with her (3 years ago) she said government was spying on her and that something was planted in her teeth.

I feel none of those symptoms, I have never had any visual hallucinations or beliefs of any sort. I have heard my name being said as I’m falling asleep, which I hear is normal.

Going through this taper (low dose .25mg klonopin for 6 weeks) I have been in a lowered mood, less desire to do things I usually do. I’m not in a  big negative mood or anything , just sort of down. I have had some feelings of hopelessness and I believe it’s caused mainly by my overall position is life at the moment, and the anxiety and ocd eating at me.

I do get surges of energy in my head . Like hyperactive feeling. I can still concentrate, and don’t lose ability to control my movements or anything , I’m just sort of wired. I don’t drink caffeine or anything either. 

I’ve sometimes have a hard time focusing on one thing, on my iPad I’ll have like 3 things going on. Sometimes listening to a podcast I will just not listen to whatever they say and sometimes have to delisted to it.

Does any of these sorts sound like something to be worried about in a diagnoses ? My psychiatrist said I shouldn’t be obsessing over it, but it’s good to be aware of it , since I have had some family history of the disease in my mother.  She did have a very traumatic child hood growing up

I'm still distracted easily and have conversations with myself during entire lectures that I need to focus on my professor talking, I'm forgetful in some cases, I'll still think to myself and randomly be singing a song in the back of my head at the same time? What concerta has helped me with is anxiety, A LOT which I'm grateful for. 

Anyways, any feedback is appreciated, I'm a little uncomfortable with moving up a dose so I just wanted feedback from you guys about how it's changed and helped you 

**TL;DR I've been on 36mg of concerta for 3 weeks, follow up appointment is friday and I'd like to know how it's helped/changed you, because I can't tell if it's working for me like I thought it should be**",adhd,adhd
"I’m not looking forward to warmer weather Summer is approaching and I’ve been noticing that I feel pretty out of place, especially with the clothes that I’m wearing. When I’m going out I notice that everyone around me is wearing summer clothing (t-shirts, shorts, tank tops). I feel self conscious because I don’t really like my body and the way it looks. I don’t like the way my stomach sticks out. It makes me feel gross. Since I don’t like how I look, it makes me feel even worse when strangers glance my way. 

I can’t hide my body in hoodies and sweatpants because the weather is too warm. I can’t wear shorts at all. It immediately puts me in a bad mood. I have to wear long pants to hide my legs. I can wear a t-shirt but I have to wear a jacket with it so that I can kinda hide my stomach, or at least make it less noticeable. Even with that attire, I still have trouble because the weather can get really hot and I’ll feel terrible. There has been a few times where the heat was really bad and I would get really sick and nauseous because I wouldn’t remove my jacket. 

Sometimes I won’t even go out because it’s too hot outside for me. I end up missing out. I really wish I could be comfortable to wear clothing and not feel sick because of the heat. I want to enjoy summer too but I don’t like my body so I’d rather endure the heat",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"Please help. A little information about me. So I have had a rough life. I lived poor my whole life. I come from a broken home my father was a abusive drunk. My mother got involved with another abusive asshole that beat me my mother and my siblings. Afterwards my mother suffered a lot of ptsd and was diagnosed with bipolar and depression as well. Our house was always dirty growing up and we never had food. I have experienced a lot of trauma  in my life time and I'm only 26. My boyfriend at that time was doing drugs and when I was 8 months pregnant he beat the shit out of me in front of my children. We were together for 8 years and he had never done anything like this before. I suffered a stroke I think it was a mix between overworking myself, stress and the recent head trauma. My son was born and I had a anuresym and leaked blood in my brain for five days until I was non verbal and couldnt make sense of anything. I spent some time in icu and then they put me in rehab. I learned how to talk, walk, and bath myself there. I have severe depression and at the moment living with my sister. She has been through a lot as well. While I was in the hospital my ex made her life a living hell. Tried to take the kids was all strung out on methaphetamine. He stalked me and came to my window at night just to scare the fuck out of me. Now to my question I'm sorry for going through all of that. When I was 16 years old I started  seeing shadows in my room at night. Then the shadows would slowly climb on my bed. I was so terrified I would hide under the blanket at night. I could never be left alone in the dark ever. I am still seeing these demons today. They touch me and I can feel everything. It feels as if I'm being raped by them. I don't know what to do. I'm currently taking anti depressants and anxiety meds. Also a anti psychotic for seeing things. I honestly don't know how to tell my doctor the extent of this. I think I may need to be hospitalized. I am just done with all of this my life is constant fear and anxiety. I worry about my kids I am constantly checking on them throughout the night worrying they may feel them too. It makes me so sick to my stomach to even think about. I just need help it is getting worse......  please someone tell me they have experienced something like this how do I fix this please help me ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"Noise cancelling headphones? Hey all, my 10 year old son was recently diagnosed with autism. He's a great kid but one of his triggers is my 4 month old newborn's cry. 

I'm working with him on his coping skills but our house is small so there is really no getting away from the noise.

I was curious about the headphones. I looked online and they look like they each have different noise reduction specs on decibels. Does anyone know the specs needed to drown out a high pitched baby's cry? Some of them I see drown out background noise but allow conversations to be heard, I'm no expert but that doesn't seem likely to drown out a baby in the next room over.

Any help would be great, thank you!",autism,autism

"Seven years later. Since the age of 17 i’ve been trying to find help to deal with my  depression and anxiety. Every single time I explained my reason why I  needed help, but there was something about me that felt different from  how others were. I tried to explain that as a child I had a hard time  keeping up with the rest. Social skills weren’t as fast and i’d rather  be alone than play with the other kids. I ended up being bullied which  caused my anxiety to fit in because how else would I survive school.

They  all said it was a phase, my anxiety was purely from being bullied and  obviously it’s why I became depressed. I believed them, took pills and  kept going to therapy every single week. I never got better. I kept  struggling socially which caused me to lose every single “friend” I had  and I started noticing I lack a lot of skills in the adult department.  They told me I was too close to my mother, I needed to be cut lose from  her, I told them if I do that I have a hard time trying to survive. I  forget to eat after awhile, I don’t take care of myself and hell, I even  forget to pee. They looked at me weirdly, thinking it was me trying to  seek an excuse to not grow apart from my mother.

6 years later at  age 23, I went to a doctor who said there’s a lady who studies autism  and helped women find out what was going on with themselves. I thought,  well, can’t hurt since all those years I didn’t feel better anyway. We  met, first time my mother went along (as she always does) and asked me certain questions. She asked me to come in the next week to talk to me  personally and if I was okay with that. My mother told me she could be  trusted (i’m not always sure) and I agreed. Week later we went trough my  entire childhood and adulthood, how I did things, how I react to  light/smell/touching/stress etc. It was odd to me, things were asked  that I was never asked before.   


A large part of my family has  autism, however only the men have it and as I thought what was tought to  me is that it doesn’t happen to women. Turns out, it does happen to  women and they’re now trying to figure out how women react differently  to certain things. There are similar things and things that they’re just  discovering. She asked me to meet with a man who has helped people for  40 years, she told me he was gentle, calm and trustworthy and is good in  listening to people who felt ignored.

4 months passed, a month  before my birthday I finally got a set date to meet with him. We talked  and he asked me to fill in tons of forms together with my mother, he  told me to take my time and see what I can remember. I did, there were  moments I was shocked when my mother told me how I was when I was  younger. She said that she always noticed I was a bit different, but  everytime she asked for help she was told it was a phase (as I was told  aswell.)   


A week before my birthday I hear it, i’m on the  Spectrum, I have autism. It’s almost two weeks later and i’m still going  trough a lot of emotions and i’m trying to place them, but it’s hard.  I’m happy, but sad at the same time. Happy because I finally know why I  have been doing things differently than from people my age, sad that it  took 7 years and I wonder what could’ve happened if I recieved this  diagnoses sooner.   


I couldn’t go to school, I was constantly  overwhelmed and work was something I struggled with. I felt hopeless,  why didn’t I function like others, why was my body making it so  difficult for me to go out and just do things like it was supposed to  do?! Now I know and it’s okay, because my brain is a bit different,  that’s all. It's taken seven years with help, but i'm just finding out who I am after years of trying to be someone i'm not.

"When should you break up with someone with a drinking problem? Hi! I’m looking for some advice about my girlfriend. We’ve been dating about a year and I’ve always known she’s had a drinking problem. I am not sure how serious it is. She has a job and stable income but she drinks every day, around 11-13 drinks and even starts as early as noon. I’ve talked to her about it before and she said she wants to quit but she usually starts up again after a week or so and it goes back to her normal levels. She’s done some things around my family (ex she took her pants off in front of my little brother) and gets angry and says things she can’t remember. We talked about it again recently and she said she would try drinking less again. But in the middle of the week after she said that she went out drinking at around 2. She called me around 1 and said she blacked out and woke up hanging over the side of the subway. She thinks she had been roofied. I feel awful saying this but I’m pretty sure she just drank too much. She was drinking a lot for a couple hours and no one approached her or talked to her the whole night. I haven’t said this to her at all because I don’t want her to think I doubt her. But I’m wondering when I should just give up. I’m starting to think this was a sign that things will always be like this. And I feel even worse that I’m even thinking that she might not have been roofied and got blackout drunk again.

"We’ve had a shitty week. Next week will be better. My son is 17 and a senior in high school. We’ve been trying to teach him independence. Slowly, but surely, he’s becoming more and more independent. 

The latest Apple update killed his phone. He was able to use it on WiFi. I tried to revert back to before the update. Instead, it did a factory reset. Which really killed it. (He ordered a new one, but it took a couple days to get here.)

I didn’t realize how important technology is for us. I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing.

When he was able to use WiFi, he texted me from school saying he was feeling sick and needed to go home. He said he’d take the bus, which stops really close to our house. The bus has WiFi, so he was able to text me when he missed the stop. He didn’t know where he was. I told him to get off at the next stop and I would find him.

Of course, it was storming.

He wasn’t at the next stop. I eventually found him at a park and ride, under a covered stop.

When we got home, I accidentally killed the phone. The next day, he had no music to listen to, which he uses music to stop from being overstimulated. He got on the bus, completely overstimulated, and got off the bus too early. 

I had no idea this was happening. It took him an hour to walk home.

The next day, he asked if I would take him to school and come pick him up. He had his laptop and sent an email saying never mind, he’d take the bus. But because the WiFi signal was stupid, it didn’t transmit and I didn’t get the email. 

I spent an hour driving back and forth between our house and the school. Husband found him, walking home from the bus stop. 

“Mom, I’ve had a really horrible week. I really hope next week is better.”

His new phone arrived. So now we are back to our normal routine. 👍🏻",autism,autism

"Friend in guild voice chat verbally abusive when drinking advice A member of our guild hangs out in our voice discord.  Normally shes great/love her being there, but when she drinks too much she becomes aggressive and self-destructive.  She will start crying/yelling, insulting or accusing members of betraying her when there is no justification, or brining up a lot of scars and traumatic incidents from her past, etc. 

Incidents used to be near daily but have slowed down to 1 incident a month-ish.  Everyone in Discord has their own way of reacting, some people leave channel, some people ignore her, some people try to argue or comfort her, etc.

Normally she will come back to the channel after a day or so and apologize.  

I wanted to get some advice from this channel on what to do.  Some advocate kicking her from the discord when she gets that drunk, but she has threatened to kill herself in the past when that type of thing happens.

"How much info is my right to share? Hi all, first time poster here. I am a first time mom of a wonderful two year old boy with autism. He is an absolute joy and brings so much happiness to everyone and I'm so happy and proud to be his mom. I have always loved sharing my life online (instagram, etc.) and documenting our life, but as he gets older and his learning delays become more apparent in comparison to kids his age, I've been hesitant to share. NOT because I'm embarrassed, but because I can't decide how much about his disability is my right to share. We don't know how growing up in the social media spotlight will affect children, and I'm hesitant to tell people about his diagnosis or what he is delayed on or the therapies we're working with, because I don't want him to grow up and be upset that I shared. I hope to raise him in a way where he's proud of who he is and doesn't feel embarrassment or shame surrounding any aspect of autism, but I simply don't know who he'll be or what he'll wish to share. I'm kind of rambling, but I'm curious to hear primarily from autistic teens/adults about your perspective on this, and I'm happy to hear from parents of autistic children as to how you've navigated this area of your child's life with respect to their boundaries that they can't communicate yet.

"I wish I wasn't me Long read for anyone witb some time....
Ive known I've had a problem since I was young, in my teenage years I learned what a complete disgrace I could be. I had partners for a long time that encouraged my drinking because everyone thought drunk me was more fun, including myself. 
Now here I am 33 with a good life, a one year old healthy son, I get to be a stay at home mom I have a husband a good house but still I drank. I'm 4 days clean now, my major ones have been alcohol and weed doesn't seem like much but it's been harder then ever to quit with my son being around because I hate the first week of recovery. It's not so much the physical withdrawals for me but the mental ones....
My husband says he understands but he doesn't. This morning I snapped because he was supposed to give me a day odd yesterday after my mental breakdown of crying for hours feeling worthless and depressed. I'm on medication and will go see a therapist next week...and well everything is a mess in the kitchen so I'm cleaning and complaining because it's my only way to vent....and he freaked out started yelling at me that I didn't let him clean last night ....no he just didn't think about it. 
He's asked me about 10 times what is wrong.... How can he keep asking ...I've told him that question sets me off time and time again, I'm having mental withdrawals all I want is to be high so I can forget about what an awful person I've been my entire life. But he doesn't understand I never feel like he even tries to see how it feels. When he quit smoking he was awful but he doesn't seem to see it the same way. He's stomping around upstairs after I had to excuse myself for an hour for some alone time too unwind...
Normally I have some sort of way to relax usually exercise when I quit drinking since I usually keep smoking pot. But without pot I have no appetite when I eat I immediately feel so full and nauseous so u have zero energy I've lost 4 lbs by just existing. I'm at my wit's end I wish he could just be patient with me. Just give me some lead way to bitch and complain because this is so hard for me. I want to be a good mom and in my opinion I just need a good week of me being able to complain when he leaves all of his garbage around his house. 
Normally it's fine I get it it's my job but I just can't right now. I used to take time off work when I quit drinking but I can't. My son had a fever and is teething so he has been screaming and yelling all week and I was alone with him for most of that. I just feel so fucking alone. I have no friends left because of what drinking has done to my life.

"u/DaffodilsTigerlilies needs help. A few days ago, a team of people from around the world came together to free a slave. It took a lot of work, a lot of prayer, and a lot of work, but we did it. This person is u/DaffodilsTigerlilies. She has decided on a new name for herself, which is Katie.

Katie is a severely Autistic woman. She was subjected to horrific abuse by her parents, who told her that she was a slave and treated her as one. She was fed every two weeks. At age 18, she ran away. Traumatized and vulnerable, she trusted a stranger who offered her a place to live and stay safe from her parents. This person turned out to be part of a pedophile ring.  

Katie was trafficked to Flint, Michigan and brought back into slavery. Her new captor tried to use her to breed more children to be used in the pedophile ring. Her captor manipulated her into marrying him. She had six miscarriages spent another eight years without any friends except for two cats, a neighbor who occasionally saw her and treated her kindly but did not know what was happening, and people she befriended online by posting messages on Reddit via a stolen cell phone. 

I'm one of those friends and when I found out what was happening to Katie, I called the human trafficking hotline to ask for help. We made an escape plan and I took a plane to Flint to help because I knew she would be scared.  Because most people don't understand Autism very well, the agencies involved in the escape plan made many mistakes and almost got Katie, her cats, me, and my dog all killed or put back into slavery. 

Fortunately there was a miracle and we are all still alive and free. We are scared because no one is arrested yet, but we hope the police will catch them soon. In the meantime, Katie has a few wishes and I want to know if you can help grant any of them.

"Cheated on my girlfriend of 1 y 4 m twice since we’ve dated when drunk...Dunno what to do This is a throwaway but yeah. I have kissed two different girls only one when I have been drunk at different times throughout our 1 year 4 month relationship. I’m drunk right now but have thought about it. Do I tell her?

I’m scared of telling her because I didn’t mean too. My ADHD and alcohol do not mix and I act impulsively to stupid decisions. She has helped me so much and I love her so much. She loves me so much. We are long distance and she plans to move here once she graduates.

I just want to know if my lying of doing these things is justified since once I have done them that I instantly regretted them and stopped doing what I was doing and withdrew from said person. It has been one kiss to two different people at our 2 month and our 1 year 1 month. These girls led me into a corner and kind of forced me but ultimately I was the one that should have been in control.

I dunno yall I really do not want to lose this girl but I need advice from my fellow ADHDers...I know what I did was wrong and I’m trying my best to change my ways...god I am. Should I tell her of something that will only hurt her if I do or should I just keep lying? 

I have made significant changes since these incidents like getting diagnosed to know what the fuck was wrong with me and implementing many different strategies on being a better person. I just want to know if being a better person if lying to her face every single day. Should I just confront her and let her know what I have let you know or should I continue as if they never happened?

God only knows how many times I have lied in my lifetime because my ADHD makes me lie so much over petty shit. However this is the first real relationship I have ever been in...I really do not know what to do reddit.",adhd,adhd

"27 years old, just diagnosed with PTSD and getting married in 2 months I am not sure what I am hoping to get with this post but have been feeling off lately, like I'm about to slip off inside my mind. Late last year, I was diagnosed with PTSD and have now been referred out for EMDR treatment which I am about to start this year. I am getting married March 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was diagnosed, I haven't been able to sleep without medication and eating is a forced situation, I just can't seem to get my stomach to relax enough to accept food without me immediately wanting to throw up. I've almost become a hermit in my own home. While I can sleep, the nightmares are still there unfortunately... I keep having nightmares of me being physically hurt and bleeding unable to get up and my fiancé screaming at me to ""hurry up"" with whatever and why am I so useless?"" or something along those lines. Sometimes it'll be my mother or siblings screaming at me though. I keep switching on and off between wanting to be hugged and being ready to claw anyone that comes near me. Sometimes within the same conversation and talking to the same person. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wedding is coming up. We had originally decided on a destination wedding to a destination that a roundtrip could be affordable ($200 or so). I picked my bridesmaids but told them secretly to not pressure them into spending money. If they went, I would set them up in the hotel, they could wear whatever they wanted. I was even planning a tour. Today, I started getting the notifications that they would not be able to attend my wedding. I've known these people for almost 10 years some. I knew not everyone could attend, but hoped a few could. I have my family still, I am still very very lucky. But my family is part of the reason that I am the way that I am. They stood by and allowed me to pick up the pieces by myself. I thought my friends had selected me. Now I am feeling rejected.

"offmychest didn't help me. do i have ptsd? so when i was young a school in our district had one of the most infamous and worst school shootings in america. our family knew some of the families that lost their kids and my family was close to a father of a person that was killed, and he recently committed suicide. there are plenty of people i know that are missing siblings or had siblings that survived, or even survived themselves. at the time, i was only a year older than some of the kids. but since i was older i wasnt at the school, just a couple miles away from it, and my younger sibling was at another school for the same grade level as the school that had the shooting, so its not like im a survivor or have any idea what they went through.

but at school today, sometimes i get anxious or get scared and start thinking of what i would do if someone shot up my school, i plan escape routes in my head, think of where i would hide, etc. when i hear a loud thump or similar noise, like someone dropping a filing cabinet in the hallway, i immediately worry that it was a gunshot. im constantly worried about someone trying to recreate the first shooting or someone targeting us because of how infamous the town as a whole is. every anniversary im on high alert the whole day and we usually get a couple bomb threats which makes things even harder. last night i had a horrible nightmare about my school getting shot up by a copycat, and i woke up terrified, and im thinking now maybe it was triggered by hearing about the virginia beach shooting. ive had nightmares like that before but this one was probably the worst.

ive been thinking maybe i have some form of light ptsd, but it doesnt really make any sense because i wasnt ever at risk of getting shot and im not a survivor of anything. i wasnt in the school and to think that i might have ptsd makes me feel like a pussy because all the survivors i know don't seem to have any issues at all. id be taking away from them to say that i have it it feels like.

"My roommate had a suicidal outburst last night Hi everybody, I'm not sure if this belongs here but I figure there's no shame in trying. My roommate is a 29 year-old statistician pursuing a PhD in our town's university. He's always been a withdrawn introverted personality. Over the last few months, I had noticed he'd been building a bar in our food pantry containing concerning amounts of hard liquor. 

Last night was the first night I saw him sloshed. He revealed to me that he's had previous problems with alcoholism and that past roommates had to intervene when he was considered a threat to himself. He revealed he'd gone to AA meetings in the past, not recently, and that he had been going to therapy. This was all new to me.

He gave me indications that he might try to harm himself. I honestly don't think he was serious, but I'm not sure. He seemed to be crying for help to see who would respond. I listened to him, did my best to calm him down and cooked him some ramen. I tried to get him to talk about some of trips and projects he had planned that are coming up to get him on back on positive ground. I told him that he can always talk to me and that he doesn't have to go through this alone. He also mentioned that he had set up a Monday meeting to see his therapist and that his boss at work had reached out to offer her support.  

My roommate seems quite troubled. I met his mom earlier this year and she seemed like a shell of a person. He only refers to his dad in past-tense. I'm not sure if his dad is still living, which really concerns me. He seems really insecure about who he is and has displayed needy and clingy tendencies towards other people he goes to school with.

I'm not really sure how to deal with this. I plan to watch him over the next few days to see how he does. I also had my own alcoholic issues in the past and I'm a believer that getting it out of the house is the first step in a positive direction. I'm not sure how to communicate this with my roommate thought.

If you guys have any thoughts, wisdom or encouragement, anything helps.

"Body perception A highly prevalent eating disorder stereotype is the concept that body dysmorphia manifests itself in a way that the perception of ones body is an objectively very large person despite exhibiting a low weight.

I’ve never personally been able to resonate with this. I’ve always felt ‘normal’ but that was the whole problem, I wanted to loose weight so I could be thinner than everyone else, have a kind of ‘augmented feature’ in a sense. So no matter how much I lost, in my eyes I would just look like an average person which drove me further as it fuelled the reason I begun to loose weight in the first place.

"How do I help a family member who doesn’t want to discuss treatment? I (30f) have been concerned with my sister’s (34f) relationship with alcohol for quite some time, as I have noticed all her daily activities must include alcohol, and she hides how much she drinks from loved ones including her spouse.  She recently opened up to me about her struggles with alcohol addiction after being hospitalized twice for alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the course of a few months.

I don’t feel qualified or knowledgeable enough to know how to be helpful.  I feel that she needs professional help.  She has tried to quit drinking a few times, which has resulted in hospitalization and/or secret binges.  I spoke to her husband after her most recent hospitalization, and he thinks I may be overreacting to feel that we should talk to her about rehab.  He thinks she may still be able to control her drinking with a little willpower and can still drink socially, whereas I do not.  

I don’t mean that condescendingly.  I am just concerned for her well-being, and now that she has confided in me, I feel responsible for what I do with this information.  But she is very defensive/self-conscious about it, which I understand.  She tells me how humiliating it is to have to confide in me about this, but that she doesn’t know who else to tell.  She doesn’t like talking about treatment or even the fact that she needs treatment.  I am so torn between showing tough love and just being a listening ear.  (I’m the past, if I have said anything about not knowing how to be helpful or asking her what I can do, her answer has been that she doesn’t know.)

"Please help. A little information about me. So I have had a rough life. I lived poor my whole life. I come from a broken home my father was a abusive drunk. My mother got involved with another abusive asshole that beat me my mother and my siblings. Afterwards my mother suffered a lot of ptsd and was diagnosed with bipolar and depression as well. Our house was always dirty growing up and we never had food. I have experienced a lot of trauma  in my life time and I'm only 26. My boyfriend at that time was doing drugs and when I was 8 months pregnant he beat the shit out of me in front of my children. We were together for 8 years and he had never done anything like this before. I suffered a stroke I think it was a mix between overworking myself, stress and the recent head trauma. My son was born and I had a anuresym and leaked blood in my brain for five days until I was non verbal and couldnt make sense of anything. I spent some time in icu and then they put me in rehab. I learned how to talk, walk, and bath myself there. I have severe depression and at the moment living with my sister. She has been through a lot as well. While I was in the hospital my ex made her life a living hell. Tried to take the kids was all strung out on methaphetamine. He stalked me and came to my window at night just to scare the fuck out of me. Now to my question I'm sorry for going through all of that. When I was 16 years old I started  seeing shadows in my room at night. Then the shadows would slowly climb on my bed. I was so terrified I would hide under the blanket at night. I could never be left alone in the dark ever. I am still seeing these demons today. They touch me and I can feel everything. It feels as if I'm being raped by them. I don't know what to do. I'm currently taking anti depressants and anxiety meds. Also a anti psychotic for seeing things. I honestly don't know how to tell my doctor the extent of this. I think I may need to be hospitalized. I am just done with all of this my life is constant fear and anxiety. I worry about my kids I am constantly checking on them throughout the night worrying they may feel them too.

"I am wondering about your experiences with latuda I’m a writer. Yes, I’ve done my due diligence in looking through the frequently asked questions sticky, read many articles on schizophrenia, and tried to look up information about Latuda. And finally, there was a mention of people I could ask directly about stuff, but no names. So hopefully this doesn’t get deleted.

I recently went down the rabbit hole of following some who definitely has delusions—impossible to say if some of what he speaks in is truth or hallucinations—and likely from all my research is at least somewhere in the realm of sz. At first, I thought this person was trolling. But as I went further and further into his posts, I saw this wasn’t the case. I seriously spent the better part of two days reading his previous posts here, and on other social media. There is a noticeable differences in his speech patterns, and acceptance of reality when he’s taking his Latuda. 

I’d also like to mention, the most eye opening part of my journey into this online personality: he was mostly kind. Passionate. Actually god damn intelligent. And this inspired me to create a more believable and relatable representation from someone suffering through this. And the saddest part is how people treated him. And in some cases, even actively tried to exacerbate his delusions. I was truly, deeply saddened by this.

Anyway, I know this is long winded, but I’m trying to make sure it doesn’t get deleted, as I’ve spent so much time trying to find answers and gotten none.

The question: I’ve read the actual side affects of the drug, but have had trouble finding some real experiences. Is there anything in that list that is missing? Does it affect you mentally in ways beyond your symptoms? I’ve read a lot of posts on here, and it seems like people feel dulled by their medicines, “vegetable” was used quite a few times; can anyone elaborate? 

Thanks a bunch for anyone who responds, and sorry again if this post was too long, or not wanted in this thread. I just want to be better informed.

"How to feel valid (tm) enough to look for a therapist specialised in trauma? CW: CSA, but nothing graphic


My last therapist basically told me she couldn't help me and I needed someone that was more long term &amp; past-focused and not so much CBT-based. (Which is a nice way of saying 'you need to talk about your childhood because you wouldn't be this fucked if nothing happened) and I took that as meaning trauma-specialised as after ending therapy with her (and nerver looked for a new therapist) I also rediscovered/not blocked out some memories  that could/are classified as CSA. Like, i am a law student, I read and understand the law, what happened is standing in the law as CSA. 
But because I was not r*ped/touched (very) sexually (Internet is a bad place for kids) I don't feel valid (tm) enough to look for someone that can help me with this. 
Doesn't help that noone besides reddit knows about what happened. 

Any advice?",ptsd,ptsd
"Do you understand confidence? I'm little bit puzzled about it.  
If you are confident, people are proud of you and tend to kind of follow you. Especially if you have a big mouth.  
At least until you do not use that confidence or big mouth against them, but use it to stomp others.

If you stomp them, they get mad at you.

&amp;#x200B;

If you do not have confidence, people have compassion with you.

At least, until you are not a coward in an important situation when everybody counts on you.

If you do that, people get mad at you.

&amp;#x200B;

How can somebody not see that and be amazed how stupid those emotions are?  
I would never follow someone or be proud of him, if he is a friend and a big mouth.

I would encourage people who have no confidence and not have compassion with them.

"New Autism-related Subreddit, and a Request for Help Hello! I've created a subreddit that's specifically designed to let the world know what it's like to be autistic, from an autistic point of view - specifically, to translate the sterile and clinical terms used to discuss and define autism into relatable human expressions of joy and engagement.

My primary motivation for this is that I was undiagnosed until age 34. I spent decades filled with self-loathing, compulsive masking and not knowing why things just seemed off - and I want to help other people like me to figure it out sooner.

Reflecting, I realized that the reason I didn't figure it out sooner was that the way autism is represented is so often using terminology that nobody would relate to. So I'd like to invite everyone here to participate, if you feel like it - post, or comment, and let's work together to create a resource for our brothers and sisters out there in the cold feeling like aliens and wondering what's going on.

"Really want to act out- instead I'm posting here I just need to vent. I have really wanted to purge the last few days. This is the longest I've gone in 7 years without purging, it's been a month and a half. My ED has made my life miserable and left me hopeless, filled with self-hatred, and suicidal countless times. I have been through the pits of absolute hell, thinking I would never be able to go this long. I couldn't make it longer than a week without purging for a long time. This has been a difficult battle and it has been easy to forget that my recovery needs to be a priority in my life today.

In the past few weeks I have struggled with restricting and bingeing on fruit/veg sometimes too. I'm trying not to beat myself up for doing shit like eating too many carrots. For the most part I'm doing pretty good. I realized today that the last week I have not been taking as good of care of myself. I don't want to be responsible for myself and I want to be the victim, and my eating disorder gives me the perfect excuse for these things. I have been running from my pain and therefore running from myself and my self-responsibility. I feel like I forget all the time that the person or thing that I need to show up and save me is MYSELF. 

I will not make my eating disorder my higher power today. I will not listen to what this stupid ED is trying to tell me. I WILL regret purging so much. It is not worth it, it is never worth it.",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous
"How do you deal with handling intense life situations? I'm 32, high-functioning (self-diagnosed, but working on getting diagnosed), and dealing with a lot of very intense/stressful situations right now (health, finances, family, career)--some of which would be as stressful to NT people, some of which wouldn't.

I'm finding myself on the verge (or over the verge) of meltdowns often, and the NT people in my life can't seem to understand why, which then I have to explain, which makes it more intense...and I often end up in a place where I feel like I can't handle the world at all and pretty much want to retreat, hide, stop doing everything, never go outside, etc. It doesn't help that I'm so sensory-sensitive that I literally can't physically handle a lot of what's going on around me, either. All this together makes one nasty combination.

Have any of you here ever developed strategies to help when life ramps up in intensity like this? I'd love any advice on how to get a better handle on how to deal with life intensities.

I eventually tapered to 6 pints a week, 5 pints, 4 pints, etc. Then once I got to just one pint a week I tapered off with low alcohol beer until the cravings were gone. So I too am an alcoholic, I judt want to know what your habits were. It helps me in the ever going struggle that is alcoholism. Keep in mind, ive noticed tapering isnt for everyone.

"My ex fwb keeps making triggering comments and gestures. Been lurking since the proED days, finally gaining some courage to post/reach out more regularly. Posting on mobile so I’m sorry if the formatting is weird! 


So, to preface: this guy was my fwb for a few months before I went home for summer vacation, and I’ve relapsed harder than ever before with the school year having started. I’ve stopped hiding it too. Most of my friends are supportive but he seems to not understand that his comments hurt me despite telling him.


I have this friend, we tell each other pretty much everything. Lately he’s been frustrated with women, saying he can’t get anyone hot and general upset over not getting laid. He constantly points out hot girls around campus, commenting on how petite they are, how he likes how dainty they look. Basically the worst stuff I already constantly think about coming from someone else. 

Today, he invited me over and I was still mad over him continuing with those comments at a football game we went to yesterday but I figured I’d try and move past it. The first thing he says to me when I get in his car is “did you see the ass on that little blonde?” As if I didn’t hate myself enough already. We get back to his place, I try to study and just chat with him and eventually he goes to bed. 

Now, I’m still not tired because I had a bunch of energy drinks (bless white monster) and I’m watching supersize vs super skinny and he wakes up. I was still on his couch because I’m too angry to share a bed and he comes over and sits by me. He covers me with the blanket next to me, which I initially thought was a kind gesture but he probably was grossed out by looking at me lol. He asks to fuck, I say no, he asks why not, I tell him we’re incompatible and if he would rather I go home I’d be happy to. He says sorry and asks for “at least a handy” to which I say no and he goes back to bed. 

Emotionally this really fucked with me. I’ve been back on campus for 2 weeks and this was his first attempt at trying anything with me and it made me feel like I was beyond a last choice. When we had the fwb thing going on, he never once complimented me and I honestly just used spending time with him to justify not eating. I know most of the issue lies with me and my internalized issues but I haven’t felt so low in a very long time. He knows my issues. I’ve stopped trying to pretend I’m fine and joke about my ED casually now. I’m literally watching ED vids on his tv right now and like he just can’t see how his comments hurt me? Am I irrational? It is now two hours later and all I can think about is leaving or crying or telling him I can’t be talked to like this but I really don’t know if I’ll shake it off and be fine tomorrow or if my emotions are justified.",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"I need a little guidance. First things first I'm not diagnosed with schizophrenia but I am diagnosed with BPD. But I've been seeing and hearing things that I know aren't real but at the same time I'm not so sure. I've tried to find information with hallucinations tied to BPD but there wasn't a whole lot I could find. 

Something I experience a lot is seeing things in the corner of my eye and when I go to look, it's gone. 
I also experience hearing multiple voices in my head that tell me all sorts of nasty things about me, convince me I'm being watched when I'm in public and tell me that people only want me around to use me,  hurt me or pity me.

I also experience very strong auditory hallucinations with things away from me, like for example yesterday I heard 6 different planes fly over my apartment building. It's common to hear one plane fly over and you can see it when you look out the window and it'll also shake the walls but I couldn't see them yesterday and they didn't shake the walls. But I was convinced 6 different planes flew over one after the other. And I was mad no one else in the apartment block were as concerned about it as me. I could hear the neighbours laughing and chatting on the ground floor but no one sounded concerned or questioned it. Im convinced it happened.

I also have episodes where I have tactile hallucinations. It's usually a paramedic that I feel is there (I dunno why) or a human male like figure. I've never seen him but I could tell you exactly what he looks like because his presence is so damn strong.

Something else I've been experiencing a lot very recently is not feeling like I'm apart of my body. Like I know I'm blinking or moving my fingers but it doesn't feel like they're my eyes or my fingers. It's if like my ""soul"" is 90% detached from my body and every movement or thought I have is foreign. That also includes where I am at the time, like my room isn't my room or my bed isn't my bed. 

I've also shut out all of my friends and acquaintances, I deleted all of my social medias a month ago, changed my number and have tried to go off the grid as much as possible.

I'm worried this is going to get worse but I'm so incredibly scared that if I told a medical professional what I'm experiencing they'll say that it's all a delusion and I'm making it up. I'm scared they'll say ""oh but people with schizophrenia don't know they have it so you're lying"". But I know that's not true? Is that true? 
For me personally I sometimes know what I'm experiencing isn't real, I don't know how I know that but I just do. And sometimes I'm convinced it's real and my partner has to tell me it's not. 

I'm scared of being labelled as crazy or a liar and I don't know what to do. 
I'm sorry if my post is in the wrong subreddit or I'm crossing any boundaries. I'm just so scared and I would really like some guidance on what I should do from here. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you all find something to smile about today ❤️

"ADHD meds and Eating Disorders I have had a history of binge eating disorder for many years. I was in therapy for few years while in college, but have recently graduated (YAY), so I no longer have that resource. I was diagnosed with ADHD about three years ago.  I tried Adderall IR, and wasn't quite right for me. Been on Adderall XR for about 1.5 years and it's been wonderful for the most part. I've been able to focus, my anxiety has lessened, and I'm able to just *function*.

Unfortunately, I'm now slipping into the other end of the spectrum and not intentionally. I've been just not wanting to eat. I know it isn't good for me, I was working out the other day and threw up nothing but bile because I had eaten what would barely constitute  single meal, let alone an average day's worth of calories. Whenever I want to eat, I can eat a little bit, but then I get nauseous and physically cannot eat more.

I don't have a new physician to see yet, but I'm working on it. I'm scared to say anything because the XR works so well for me in so many ways. I'm just frustrated and scared and sad right now. 

Any words of advice, encouragement, etc would be wonderful.

Other than that I'm sticking to it.

This is v tmi but yknow how chewing gum can have laxative effects if you chew too much?

I think I can kinda feel/ very slightly see that I look a bit smaller since yesterday but I dunno if that's just in my head.

"How to help increasingly violent brother. Hi All,

I'm so glad i found this sub, thank you to everyone who is here for being here. Just reading the sub makes me feel support. 

Anyway, my 17 year old brother is on the spectrum and his episodes of getting angry when he doesn't get his way/is corrected are becoming more frequent.  When he's in this mood he throws things,  he has broken phones, tvs , utensils etc. He has also attracted me and my mum once. 

My parents so far are only interested in miracle/religious  cures and i have been pleading with them to consider therapy,  or at least see someone who can help us understand his behavior. All to no avail. There are no consequences for the violent behavior,  all they do is look for another prophet to ""deliver "" him. 

He's also recently started,  well masturbating, i found out when i was hearing wierd noises coming from his room. The door was open. My parents are religious and I'm very sure they won't handle this well. I don't know how to either. 

My parents are useless when it comes to helping him become independent.  He can cook his own food but my mother will still wake up, ask him what he wants to eat and prepare it for him. I keep telling them to stop making him dependent on them. No one listens. 

I don't know how to talk to him. I'm 23 and really just want to move out of the craziness but i really feel scares for his future.

I’m extremely proud of her for stepping up and working on the issue. I love this woman and would be devastated if it had consumed her without me knowing. I write her letters and talk to her on the phone when she can call. She seems to be doing very well and has made it clear that she is putting in a lot of effort.

"We have to look out for each other. [Trigger warning -- includes some statistics that are upsetting ] This is random but it's an issue that means a lot to me as it has affected me personally. 

I was reading about autism today, I guess sort of as a special interest (but that's besides the point.) It just made me realise how important it is, whether you have autism, or if you know people who are autistic, that you look out for them and that you talk to people if you're struggling, because not everyone understands us, as I'm sure we all know from experience and that can be hard.

I found out that autistic children are 28x times as likely to attempt suicide \[[source](https://www.autistica.org.uk/what-is-autism/signs-and-symptoms/suicide-and-autism)\]. That breaks my heart, but your time and kindness could be the reason that they don't, it could make someone's day, be the spark of light that reminds them how wonderful they are. Remember to be calm, be mindful of people's needs and stay non-judgemental.

Other mental health conditions are also more likely in autistic people \[[source](https://www.autism.org.uk/about/health/mental-health.aspx)\], such as: anxiety and OCD. Young people are more likely to struggle with these as well, so the same applies, be mindful of people's anxieties and other triggers (as I'm sure you all are)

We can't all be professional counsellors, we can't always have all the answers and professional help is often needed but that doesn't mean you can't play a part. I'm sorry for the gloomy tone of this post but it's a really important issue.

\---I would include the numbers you should call if you if you are concerned for your own, or somebody else's mental health but obviously this would vary by country.

I can't use alcohol to socialze otherwise it will turn me alcoholic and it's not a good elxiir. I do wish there was a drink/potion that made autistic people eaiser to chat and socialise without side effects or anger.

I do wish I could meet someone via r/autism but it's a pipe dream. I tried Tinder but no replies and like I said, NERVOUS!

Do not feel bad for me, I am just drunk and will wake up tomorrow seeing replies and possibly moderators saying this post breaks rules.

"Alcoholic father ruined my life, am being suicidal because of this, while his excuse is ""my father was even worse than I am"" I'm 27, he's been an alcoholic since about 2000, so he essentially ruined my whole teenager life, and many years of my adulthood.
I literally have no positive memories with him, just drunk episodes, lot of them. I even got a lethal threat from him a few weeks ago ""give me a glass of moonshine or I'll kill you""
Next day, his excuse was ""I was drunk, I don't even remember any of it""

"Hey any advice on a friend being enabled by other toxic people? What is the best most compassionate “non-enabling” way to handle this situation?

I have an alcoholic friend who stays over my place for recovery and sometimes goes to see an enabler to get drunk. (But never admits it).

This person is aware they are endangering my friend but their clingy obsession with my friend means they are happy to be an enabler, consciously, to keep my friends company. 

My friend will probably not live through the year if the addiction continues and has expressed the desire to stop but still lies about drinking when she is away.

I can’t afford to worry about her 24/7 but I also don’t want her to feel like help isn’t there anymore and she only has the enabler to turn to.

"Advice on finding a new psychiatrist because my current one is as bad at focusing on the matter at hand (my ADHD) as I am at keeping things focused? The psychiatrist I’ve been seeing for the past 6 years is a pain in the butt. He’s the one who diagnosed me initially and I got another, more thorough, diagnosis a couple years ago from a different doctor. However, while I don’t doubt I have ADHD, I’m not confident that I’m properly treating it. I’m not sure I’m on the right medication for my ADHD/anxiety and I barely get a chance to discuss it with him because he’s busy researching whatever interesting thing I mentioned. 

Unfortunately, even though I live in an affluent area of Northern California, I feel like I can never find any other options. 

Add to that, the stress of being laid off in December and turning 26 in June, and you’ve got an exciting mess of brain chemistry happening.

"The Perfect High Did you know Shel Silverstein also wrote poems for adults? Long but worth the read...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There once was a boy named Gimmesome Roy. He was nothing like me or you. ’Cause laying back and getting high was all he cared to do. 

As a kid, he sat in the cellar, sniffing airplane glue. And then he smoked bananas –– which was then the thing to do. 

He tried aspirin in Coca–Cola, breathed helium on the sly, and his life was just one endless search to find that perfect high.

But grass just made him want to lay back and eat chocolate–chip pizza all night, and the great things he wrote while he was stoned looked like shit in the morning light.

And speed just made him rap all day, reds just laid him back, and Cocaine Rose was sweet to his nose, but the price nearly broke his back.

He tried PCP and THC, but they didn’t quite do the trick, and poppers nearly blew his heart and mushrooms made him sick.

Acid made him see the light, but he couldn’t remember it long, and hashish was just a little too weak, and smack was a lot too strong, 

And Quaaludes made him stumble, and booze just made him cry, Till he heard of a cat named Baba Fats who knew of the perfect high.

Now, Baba Fats was a hermit cat who lived up in Nepal, High on a craggy mountaintop, up a sheer and icy wall.

""But hell,"" says Roy, ""I’m a healthy boy, and I’ll crawl or climb or fly, But I’ll find that guru who’ll give me the clue as to what’s the perfect high.

""So out and off goes Gimmesome Roy to the land that knows no time, Up a trail no man could conquer to a cliff no man could climb.

For fourteen years he tries that cliff, then back down again he slides. Then sits –– and cries –– and climbs again, pursuing the perfect high.

He’s grinding his teeth, he’s coughing blood, he’s aching and shaking and weak, As starving and sore and bleeding and tore, he reaches the mountain peak.

And his eyes blink red like a snow–blind wolf, and he snarls the snarl of a rat, As there in perfect repose and wearing no clothes –– sits the godlike Baba Fats.

""What’s happening, Fats?"" says Roy with joy, ""I’ve come to state my biz. I hear you’re hip to the perfect trip. Please tell me what it is.

For you can see,"" says Roy to he, ""that I’m about to die, So for my last ride, Fats, how can I achieve the perfect high?"" 

""Well, dog my cats!"" says Baba Fats. ""here’s one more burnt–out soul, Who’s looking for some alchemist to turn his trip to gold. But you won’t find it in no dealer’s stash, or on no druggist’s shelf. Son, if you would seek the perfect high –– find it in yourself.""

""Why, you jive motherfucker!"" screamed Gimmesome Roy, ""I’ve climbed through rain and sleet, I’ve lost three fingers off my hands and four toes off my feet! I’ve braved the lair of the polar bear and tasted the maggot’s kiss. Now, you tell me the high is in myself. What kind of shit is this? My ears ’fore they froze off,"" says Roy, ""had heard all kind of crap, But I didn’t climb for fourteen years to listen to that sophomore rap. And I didn’t crawl up here to hear that the high is on the natch, So you tell me where the real stuff is or I’ll kill your guru ass!""

""Ok, OK,"" says Baba Fats, ""you’re forcing it out of me. There is a land beyond the sun that’s known as Zaboli. A wretched land of stone and sand where snakes and buzzards scream, And in this devil’s garden blooms the mystic Tzu–Tzu tree. And every ten years it blooms one flower as white as the Key West sky, And he who eats of the Tzu–Tzu flower will know the perfect high. 

For the rush comes on like a tidal wave and it hits like the blazing sun. And the high, it lasts a lifetime and the down don’t ever come. But the Zaboli land is ruled by a giant who stands twelve cubits high. With eyes of red in his hundred heads, he waits for the passers–by. 

And you must slay the red–eyed giant, and swim the River of Slime, Where the mucous beasts, they wait to feast on those who journey by. And if you survive the giant and the beasts and swim that slimy sea, There’s a blood–drinking witch who sharpens her teeth as she guards that Tzu–Tzu tree.""

""To hell with your witches and giants,"" laughs Roy. ""To hell with the beasts of the sea.A s long as the Tzu–Tzu flower blooms, some hope still blooms for me. ""And with tears of joy in his snow–blind eye, Roy hands the guru a five, Then back down the icy mountain he crawls, pursuing that perfect high.

""Well, that is that,"" says Baba Fats, sitting back down on his stone, Facing another thousand years of talking to God alone. ""It seems, Lord"", says Fats, ""it’s always the same, old men or bright–eyed youth, It’s always easier to sell them some shit than it is to give them the truth.""

"For anyone considering lifeguarding. Hi, I understand this post will appeal to a very niche demographic but there is no /r/adhdlifesavers so bear with me. 

SO,  being the person who needs to constantly force himself to self-affirm, I decided to Google my profession and my condition. ""ADHD lifeguard"" doesn't have a lot of solid or informative results and I realized had I known about my adhd before I was certified to guard, I may have stopped myself.

So, to answer the question ""I have ADHD, can I become a lifeguard?"" I can say: ""Yeah, probably.""

I work for the best pool in my entire province (Canada (no, not all the water here is frozen)) and I can say that a lot of it comes down to learning techniques that work for you and using triggers or cues to refocus,  if needed.

I hardly take Adderall at work anymore. Yeah, I zone out occasionally but I am damn good at my job. The trick is to refocus so often that you don't unreasonably miss danger. 

I'm lucky that I change guarding positions every five minutes but it's also nice when it's crazy busy and the stress of the crowd brings in your attention. That last point isn't ADHD-exclusive, everyone experiences it to a degree.

I actually know of two other lifeguards here with ADHD who are much more talented than me and we all do fine. Between the three of us, we're on Adderall, Vyvanse, and Ritalin and we all guarded for years before any medication.

If you're concerned, you can always try it. Try as hard as you can to be good at it because it's not an easy job for someone with or without ADHD. If anything, you'll learn skills that translate into the rest of your life.",adhd,adhd

"Fiance is an alcoholic So last night my fiance of several years dropped the bombshell that he's an alcoholic and has been lying to me about it for a significant amount of time.

We have a 4 month old baby, which is why he came clean. He is currently staying with family so as not to detox around us.

I guess a lot of things make sense now. His drinking had been an issue for me for some time, but I was concerned that it could develop into a problem, I had no idea that it had already gone that far. He ""gave up"" drink while I was pregnant for a month and had also ""cut down"" at my request. It turns out that this was entirely untrue and he is a functioning alcoholic who is very good at lying to me.

I am there to support him through this and our relationship will be fine as long as he can beat it. I have no desire to bring up our child around an alcoholic like I was. I will leave if I have to.

"Well, it’s safe to safe I have a problem. Thank you in advance for listening to this. I’ve been drinking mostly every day for about 2 years now. I’m 34 and up until a couple of years ago, I would have a drink maybe once a month with friends and most of the time, I’d never even finish it. My wife has been a wine enthusiast for as long as I’ve known her and enjoys having a glass in the evenings. I would always pick up her wine and one day roughly 2 years ago, I decided to pick up some beer for myself. Long story short, every evening (with the exception of maybe 5 evenings) for the last 2 years, ’ve been drinking a 6 pack of craft beer (7-9abv). Some nights, I’ve walked to the gas station to get more (at least I didn’t drive drunk).  Two days ago, my wife and I decided we were no longer going to drink. I made it through the first night, but yesterday I stopped at the liquor store and purchased 4 pocket rockets of vodka. I felt that having them on hand would help me. In the event I had a craving, I could shoot one of those and be good. Well, it’s now 7am and I drank all 4. I used to be the guy that would wonder how someone could possibly drink in the morning. The truth is, I had one and I couldn’t stop. Knowing they were there and available was enough to make me finish them off in order to chase the buzz.

"Does any other autistic on here have similar pet peeves? Posted something similar on r/aspergers and figured I'd widen my pool since not everyone with HFA/aspergers goes onto that sub. Anyway, these are a bunch of things that really get under my skin as an autistic person (albeit ones that don't have to do with autism) and I think they're all connected.

* Overly-simplified descriptions of how to do something (e.g. on the post on r/aspergers I gave the example of a reply to a R/showerthoughts thread about Build-A-Bear Workshop that describes part of the bear-building process as ""kids say some cute rhymes and then pick out a lovey"")

* On a similar note to said example (even when it isn't directed at me), when anyone who's puberty-age-and-older uses baby talk and/or talks in a really cutesy childish perky manner (including such affectations as using w in place of r) when they're not talking to a really young child (and no, it isn't just cutesy babey talk that falls under that umbrella but a lot of the stereotypical ""lol i'm so random XD"" scene girl stuff especially when they veered towards the perky-goth side of scene)

* ""Stage directions"" like [laughs] or [music plays] in the closed-captions when I'm watching a video

* Those posts on certain sorts of social networks that say things like ""Every [show] episode ever"" or ""Every [artist] song ever"" and then have not just similar stage directions/descriptions to the aforementioned kinds I hate but really stereotypical [dialogue, lyrics etc.]

I guess, if I could find the connecting thread between said pet peeves it's that I don't like feeling dumb (the first and third fall under that umbrella because I don't like being told something I already know, the fourth because I feel like I'm getting poorly fansplained at and the second (despite being the odd one out) because when I read that kind of talk I hear that kind of voice in my head and feel like I'm getting talked down to if I'm not the target)",autism,autism

"How bad will my (22F) withdrawal symptoms be based on my drinking habits? I have been drinking alcohol socially since I was about 18. However, I never really drank outside of a social setting until I was about 20, when I would have wine with dinner alone, or have a beer here and there. However, since I turned 21, I started to drink a lot more, because I was finally of legal age to do so. This past fall, I made friends who party constantly, and I found myself going to the bars at least three times a week, and frat parties two times a week. And when I drank, I would almost always black out. That has been my lifestyle for the past few months. 
About two weeks ago, I went on a spring break trip to Cabo, and I drank all day, every day. After those four days, I came home and partied with my friends for the whole weekend. Then, on Monday, it was syllabus week, which at our school basically means: party week. So I was blackout drunk all day everyday that entire week. And that weekend, I went on a formal to Vancouver and was drunk that entire weekend too.
However, when I came home from Vancouver, I counted up the days that I had been drunk, and realized that I hadn’t been sober at all for 13 days straight. It was the longest bender I’ve ever been on/heard of. That’s when I realized I needed to detox, and I’ve decided that I don’t really want to drink for a while because of how terrible I feel. But I’m worried that I may face some pretty severe withdrawal symptoms after a bender like that. What I’m wondering is: is a 13 day bender really enough time to make me experience severe withdrawal symptoms? Or would I have had to have drank for much longer than that?
It’s been two days since my last drink and I’ve experienced some symptoms of withdrawal such as extreme night sweats, waking up delirious and confused multiple times throughout the night, minor hallucinations (seeing things move in the corner of my eye or behind trees), general confusion and extreme fatigue.
However, I was researching withdrawal symptoms and they apparently get worse around day 4? So I’m just nervous that this might get worse?
Basically, am I okay detoxing at home or should I seek help? Or am I being a hypochondriac even asking?

Any info would be very helpful thank you!

TL;DR I have been drinking a lot for months now and recently went on a 13 day bender where I wasn’t sober for 13 days straight. Now I am on day 2 of not drinking and have experienced some withdrawal symptoms (night sweats, confusion, fatigue, etc) and am wondering if a 13 bender is enough to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. And if so, should I seek help or am I okay to detox at home? I feel like 13 days isn’t that long, and that the withdrawal symptoms shouldn’t be that severe. But I don’t know.

"How did your doctor diagnose you with ADHD? Starting in my 20’s, I began noticing it was getting more and more challenging to concentrate at work. I would take frequent breaks in order to reset myself but all those breaks caused my productivity to go way down. I never had problem concentrating in school so I never thought I had ADHD until I randomly came across an article online about adult ADHD. After reading this article and researching symptoms and knowing that adderall helps with concentration, I decided to see a psychiatrist and get a diagnosis. The psychiatrist diagnosed me by having me fill out a questionnaire that looked like it had been poorly photocopied a thousand times that asked me generic questions about my concentration and if I get bored easily. And just based on that questionnaire, he diagnosed me with having ADHD and prescribed me adderall. I thought that was way too quick and easy of a diagnosis. It made me think this doctor didn’t care if I truly had ADHD or not and just thought I was trying to get an adderall prescription and so he could get a new patient and make more money. A few years later I visited a different doctor for a diagnosis and she had me fill out the exact same questionnaire and immediately prescribed me just like the previous doctor did.

When she returned, she was HORRIFIED to hear I was still on it and refused to refill without an appointment, a second opinion, and talking to my OB. 

Here’s the thing - my OB is ENTIRELY supportive of me taking my medication throughout my pregnancy and breastfeeding. He supplied me with articles from medical journals and the government websites for lactation transmissions so I could be informed of the risks and make my own choice. Given that our baby was on track and low-risk for everything we tested for, we decided it was best for me to remain on my meds for my emotional well being that is so essential for self-care (and hence, baby care).

I was furious that my psych was disregarding my mental health for the remote chance of harming my fetus. I did everything she asked and her second-opinion doctor said I was very rational about my decision and well informed. I got my refill, but now she wants to talk about postpartum.

Tomorrow afternoon we have an appointment, and I’m not happy. She wants to switch me to Wellbutrin after the baby is born and I am NOT on board. Wellbutrin doesn’t treat ADHD, it’s basically an antidepressant and not at all what I need. I don’t think changing my medication immediately postpartum is a good idea considering my hormones will be all over the place. I will need all the tools I can to manage a newborn and my changing body, and my Adderall is an important tool for my brain to function. I’m afraid that without it I may forget my newborn in a car, that my anxiety will run rampant and delay lactation, that my already stressed situation will explode and I won’t be able to take care of myself or my baby. 

The studies for Adderall and breastfeeding recommend watching your newborn for signs of fussiness. A fussy baby is something I can deal with. If it’s bad, I can alternate with formula to wean them off and see what we can do from there. The papers on Wellbutrin scare me. Fussiness, low lactation rates, and most importantly - there is evidence of infants having SEIZURES when exposed to it. SEIZURES vs fussiness?! Really?! 

I want to tell my psychiatrist that I do not appreciate her abandoning my mental health so she can play obstetrician. I do not agree with her treatment plan and I want to stick with my current dosage and have her focus on my mental health as it relates to my pregnancy and motherhood. I am no longer sure she has MY best interests in mind, and with everyone telling me what I can and can’t eat, what I can and can’t do, what I can and can’t be, the last thing I need is someone whose job it is to take care of ME to abandon me for someone who doesn’t really exist yet. If she can’t support my decisions as an individual and focus on my care, I may have to seek treatment elsewhere.

Is this rational? Is this outrageous? Will this trigger her calling CPS or institutionalizing me? What do I do now?",adhd,adhd

"Numb lips etc - question/help please Hey guys, not a very interesting title! 

This isn’t my normal account because some Real Life people know me on there. 

Getting to the point, I’ve probably been a heavy drinker/alcoholic for about 10 years now (28yrs, now 38yrs female).

You’ll all laugh at this but it’s never really caused me any issues. My industry is very drug and drink friendly. Late to work because you had a big night last night? Hilarious! One guy even got a certificate for ending up in the hospital after a work party. 

But when I think about it - I have had issues with digestion and err, toilet things. I just chalked it up to undiagnosed food intolerances. 

It still didn’t put me off the wine. 

The thing that has scared me is, about three weeks ago I started getting numb little toes not just in the morning - all day. Now numb fingers and for the last week a numb mouth/lips/lower cheeks. 

Of course I’ve done online sleuthing and discovered alcoholic neuropathy and it all pretty much says it’s irreversible. 

I know you aren’t doctors (unless any of you are?) but could stopping drinking within a month of the first symptoms be considered ‘early’ enough to reverse the damage? When it says vitamins is a good multi vitamin enough? 

I can’t imagine never feeling my lips again or feeling the cat’s fur when I pat it. 

Yes I know I need to go to the doctor but it’s on my mind now.

"Is it worth getting diagnosed while being over 20 years old. Hello there. Sorry for my english if it's bad in some places. First time here, hope everyone welcomes me if i decide to stay for a while and i also hope that you can help me with some of my problems.
Today while doing my morning routine (sitting in bed while scrolling through reddit) i read something in the comments of one post about ADHD wich really resonated with me and i started to dig in further about the condition. After some googling and reading some articles (and i'm not saying i believe them all because everyone know what you can find using google)i gathered the most common information between articles and this subreddit and i think i might have ADHD.

&amp;nbsp;


Here is a something about my life that may help you believe me. I was always the kid that talked the most about all the things and could not sit in the class for more than 5 mins (and i know that describes about 50% of kids, but wait there's more...). At start i tried to be a good student and i had the potential to be one (at least i think so based on my iq) but after being not that successful in some parts of my school life i gave up on that. I went through all the school up till collage without sitting down and doing homework or studying once (and i know it sounds like its made up but the sad thing for schools in poland is that it is not). I got my homework from friends before every class and if i didnt feel like it i would just say i didn't do it. I was liked by most of people in my class and most of the teachers so they just let me slide. After i went to collage i could not stay there for long. Up untill that point i had something that forced me to go to school and i was not a bad kid so i didn't want my parents to be unhappy but i started living in another city and with nothing that was forcing me to go to university to sit thorugh boring lectures i just didn't. I was also pretty depressed back then and i didn't see the point in doing preety much anything.

&amp;nbsp;


Now i'm 21 and i finally found my motivation and really want to achieve something in life. I quit smoking, alcohol, and any drugs (which was mostly weed but still i think it's for the better). I study through most of my day and got a group of friends and we are working on a game together. Sounds like a perfect story with happy ending right? Well you are kind of wrong. Here are the things that annoy me about day to day life that i think may be caused by ADHD:

&amp;nbsp;


-I get distracted by almost every little thing.

&amp;nbsp;


Example: I love to read books but i have to read some lines of text a few times because i start thinking about other things while reading them and i don't even notice it of the bat.

&amp;nbsp;


- I forget small things all the time.

&amp;nbsp;


Example: When i go out with my dog after i get back home i close the door, lock it up, go upstairs and.... oh wait did i lock the door? And sometimes i go look it up and then when i get up i still am not sure.
I also forget what I or other people have said like few seconds ago.

&amp;nbsp;


-I overreact to things that i know are small and waste a lot of time on them.

&amp;nbsp;


Example: I may be friends with someone for a few years but ohhh boy when they say one thing that i find suspicious i start questioning our whole relationship through the years (Maybe he pretend to be my friend for like 10 years. Cuz that's what normal people do duh.)

&amp;nbsp;


And i could go on and on but i want to eat my breakfast even though it's already cold.

&amp;nbsp;


Ohh before i go i forgot to put in something. People would say ""Well i know you have these problems but look, you said you have your life together so who cares?"" Well even with the things that i want to do now like study more about game making which interests me i get distracted without noticing it and start browsing reddit or some other site.
So what do you guys think?

&amp;nbsp;


TL;DR: I think i might have ADHD but is it still worth to go get diagnosed. Where do i go, if so?

"New to Reddit, New to ADHD Hey there, 

SO. I have quite a story here. I was hoping I could grab some opinions and come to a reasonable conclusion lol

Here is some context to the situation:

I'm 24, and I was diagnosed with ADHD in September 2017.

My life before that was.. awful. I came to the conclusion that I was just stupid and I: needed to accept it, keep fighting, or give up. 

I wrote a letter to my family and booked a flight to BC for July. I had a plan, a place, a drink. I wasn't going to suffer, and keep disappointing my family any longer. 

My psychiatrist urged me to stay a make an immediate appt, and either make a visit to the psych ward or stay with family/friends. 

I chose the ladder.

During my stay, I came across a video on YouTube describing what ADHD was like. I quite literally started bawling. I remember the thought process being described as ""your thoughts are on a carousel"" and another as ""It's like your thoughts are on a TV, but someone else has the controller""

I've been in therapy since I was 8 years old, and ADHD was NEVER an option. It was either depression, anxiety (or, as I got older, Social anxiety or Borderline personality disorder) 

Nobody was interested in my opinion or what was actually going on in my head. I was on the receiving end of many disciplinary actions and MANY parent-teacher meetings. 

I dropped out of school in grade 7, returned to school for Grade 9, and dropped out again after grade 10. The classes never seemed to be fast enough, and I felt that the participation aspect was redundant. I LOVED taking assignments home, but the my absences were piling up and I was no longer accepted in class. 

I've always wanted to attend university, pursue knowledge, but I just.. couldn't. I admitted defeat.

Why was everything so easy for everyone? It wasn't comprehension that I had issues with, or application. It was interest, and time management.

I wasn't particularly angry, or socially anxious. I was just.. infuriated with my brain. My thoughts would disappear mid-sentence, I would lose attention or interest in almost anything very quickly (if I found it redundant or pointless), I couldn't read anymore, or even watch movie.

2013- So, after high school, I decided to get my GED..
Nope. Missed a class.

2014 - Tried to get my grade 12 via 7 individual credits.
No, Missed the max amount.

2016 - registered for an adult 12 day program.
Nope, I'm too stupid. What do I think I'm doing here??

 Meanwhile, I had 5 failed relationships, owned and lost 3 cars, left or was fired from 24+ different jobs, and I had no plan. Nothing was ever consistent. I could do something one day, but I couldn't count on it the next day. 

I just had to accept that I was stupid.

After I brought this all to my psychiatrists attention, and mentioned ADHD, it's like a lightbulb went off in his head. I brought him old report cards (all of which had the same ""Damazerzer has so much potential but needs to pay attention in class"", ""Poor time management skills"", ""Damazerzer needs to focus, she succeeds when she TRIES"" ect. Ect.)

I was prescribed Vyvanse that appt. and my life has improved exponentially. 

I'm incredibly organized, I have drive to do things, my thoughts are coherent, I have long-term and short-term goals.

And, I'M IN SCHOOL (again lol)!

I got my first A in almost 10 years, and I can actually wake up and head to school in the morning. 

Vyvanse has changed my life, and given me access to my brain!

Now, to the point of my post;

What now? 

Is it too late to go to university? What's a healthy level of activity? What's a healthy level of interest?

How has ADHD medication affected you?

Are you happy?

Thanks for reading!

I'm sorry if this post is a bit informal, I was inspired by this page to share.

"Things get easier. My experience of getting better. Brief mention of abuse without getting into details (also start and end are pointed out) This post was supposed to be a rant. 
I was feeling a bit gloomy after a flash-back, but as I kept writing I started to calm down. Hence the change in the tone.

Also, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. 

Sorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. 

I guess I have improved a lot in the last year. 
I really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.

To prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.

I still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. 
It makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. 

Up until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. 
The present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.

I used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.
 
I kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. 
I didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. 

**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**

I had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. 

**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**

After I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.
Hadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.

Although comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.

Things were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. 
I was horrified at what I had done. 
I'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. 

It's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. 
I had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.

But most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.
It's not what you or your loved ones need. 
The ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. 
You can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. 

Being passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. 

It's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. 
But please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. 
 
You won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love.

"Question about symptoms I'm a 19 year old guy who has medically diagnosed PTSD and I have a question about something I've been experiencing. I want to know if this is a symptom or if it has a name or anyone has any tips on how to deal with it. Thank you in advance!

Often and especially when my friends, who I love more than anything, are trying to comfort me/ask me what's wrong/make sure I'm okay I find myself completely shutting down. I physically cannot speak and find it very difficult to move and especially cannot make eye contact or keep myself from retreating to a ball shaped position. These are things I do when I am having a flashback or am badly triggered but there's no accompanying flashback and I don't really understand why I might be being triggered. I hate it a lot because I can't communicate and only worry people even more. Is there a name for this shutting down kind of thing? And is it a PTSD symptom? It definitely seems at least PTSD adjacent. Does anyone know how to break out of it?

If it helps: my PTSD is incest and sexual abuse/rape related.

"Worst Flashback Yet (TW for.... Flashbacks?) Hi all,   


I'm not sure what to even say. I'm posting during a brief reprieve in what I think has probably got to be my worst flashback ever. The trauma was more than six years ago, and I have come so far in my treatment and recovery since then. Tonight my boyfriend did something that set me off big time. It wasn't really his fault but it's really bad. This is the worst things have ever been. I can smell the smells from what happened, which I've never even remembered before. I cant stop shaking and I've bitten myself and hit myself to try to keep from screaming. I'm normally not like this at all, and I'm embarrassed and ashamed and feel out of control. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to get up and eat a few bites of ice cream because I thought the cold would help, and that has snapped me back to reality for a minute. I took a xanax (though it was a tough choice... I'm a student and my university services won't prescribe benzos for long term b/c they think students abuse them so I am almost at the end of what they'll prescribe me. So I didn't want to take one because I try really hard to save them and stretch them out, but I think I really really had to tonight.) And frankly I am drinking a little bit, too, right now which I know is not the right thing to do but I'm just trying to do anything I can to keep my shit together right now.

I don't even know why I'm posting or what I'm hoping to get out of it except that i need to say all of this to someone who I know knows what I'm talking about.

"Ex Disney Intern ED Hey yall this is my first post on anything reddit related, so cut me some slack if I am too wild or not following the rules. I am pretty shitty with writing things so hop off. This might be long but I am going to describe my current life and would love some suggestions on how to turn my life around.

I did a year long internship at Walt Disney World working at a popular mountain. While working there about halfway through my internship, I snapped and developed an eating disorder. My typical day would consist of bubbly water and two tiny bags of 100 calorie pop chips. It completely destroyed the rest of my time at Disney but it made me skinny. I went down from 220 lbs starting the internship to 135. Upon returning back to my small college town I have gained and lost more weight. It has been non stop going up and down. To give some perspective I am a 5 7 male weighing in last at about 141 lbs. I dont know whether this is good or bad anymore due to my mind and perception being so warped. Recently, I have been encouraged to go out with my friends for drinks and food. I dont want to socially isolate myself and say no like I did during my internship at disney, but I do not want to get fat again. I am currently having a meltdown and one of the worst days of my life because the past two nights i have been going out to drink with friends (and drinking inhibits my judgement and causes me to binge like fucking crazy). I am wearing a hoodie that is 4 sizes too big I look ridiculous but I dont want anyone to see my body. Tonight is my sisters birthday and we are suppose to go out for margaritas and food (of fucking course am I right) and I want to participate and have fun but I dont want to feel like shit about myself. What do I do about my current situatuion? If i try and eat normally I end up binging and then extremely restriciting by fasting a couple of days and then eating low calorie healthy for a couple of days it is an endless vicious cycle that is fucking with me. I can't remember what its like just to wake up in the morning and just eat without thinking about it. This was suppose to just help me lose weight and now I can't even go an hour without a body check or thinking about how I am going to lose weight next. I have been going to the doctor recently and therapist I am on new meds but I don't think it is helping and I think I have far deeper rooted issues that prevent me from making myself vulnerable. I see everything as a joke and not serious and I have a terribly hard time having compassion or showing empathy for people. i often fake it so I seem more human. I also recently havent had much of any emotions. Besides hatred towards myself for being fat and ugly which will never get me a boyfriend, I dont get sad or happy.

"Opinions on finding purpose Hello everyone,
Thanks to everyone on this sub who lends an ear.

Just wanted to hear the feelings around finding purpose..
I recently overcame (mostly) all my fucked my emotional issues. Self loathing/shame etc- sounds like fun, but.../
It was my main thing that kept me moving- I'm kind of now at a point where I have nothing to build a life around. Generally speaking I think the world is a fair bit fucked and I should should try to contribute to making it better- but the only way I feel I could add anything would be to challenge many of our societal norms/beliefs. I worry/expect that this would just affirm me as an outcast. So currently just accepting the world for a bit of a shit place and don't see any reason to try and fight it. 
Anyone out there find something which matters to them (beyond building wealth/status?).

"It's almost every night that I reassure myself ""It's ok, bluedreams21, don't worry about today. Tomorrow, you're going to do even better."" I started a PhD program last fall, and while fall semester was ok since I was on 30mg adderall XR, my psychiatrist, who is the dean for the university's psychiatry hospital unit, decided that I should start Strattera instead, even though I've tried it for 3.5 months two years ago, and it would work slightly before ceasing to work.

I've been having a rough semester due to being on Strattera the past month, and I haven't felt this ashamed of myself so often. I haven't done this in a while since I was being medicated with Adderall for two years, but I find myself often thinking that ""It's ok - tomorrow will be even better than today.""

I wish I could make a super hopeful, inspiring post or something, but I just needed someone who might understand to read this. It just makes me really sad that I haven't had this habit of reassuring myself every night for the past two years on Adderall because I was *doing real work*. I wasn't letting myself down.

Maybe the title sounds inspiring, but to me, it makes me realize that without any treatment, I used to let myself down so often that I *had* to believe tomorrow was going to be better because today was so bad.

"Confusion about my mental case Family has a log side of mental issues my grandma is fully schizophrenic and has to be monitored and My father is bipolar with borderline schizophrenia. I am currently 19, diagnosed bipolar type one with extreme anxiety. I was diagnosed when i was 16 cause thats when the depression really hit was that year but the anxiety was always there it was just always regarded as me being shy. But im on the line of thinking i have schizophrenia or have it coming. When im alone i always feel like “something” is watching me and i truly believe it. But if you ask me about it ill shrug it off and say your right nothing is there. I have had experiences as a kid where i just felt evil in the room and spiritual things happen that make my body chill. Even as im typing this right now i have a feeling someTHING is watching me just out of my peri feral. I know schizophrenic people hear voices but that only has happened to me a couple of times and hasn’t happened in months. Only voice i hear tho is screaming banshees just women yelling as loud as they can, the last occurrence was last year around September. I also only have one friend, reason being is because ill talk to someone for a while, then completely cut them off like not even answer text and i feel ok with it no remorse. There is a little remorse ill get sad every now and then about it but my head says “ they cant backstab you now they are gone”. And when i meet new people anymore its not meeting its me analyzing the entire time, me analyzing if they are a threat to me if I befriended them or (even tho i know its wrong as fuck) if i could use them to my advantage and then cut them off. Lastly the thing that worries me is, i act like a good person, i get along with everyone just fine and im friendly at work, but dont get on my bad side. I think about hurting people way to much. The other day someone pissed me off at work and i argued and cursed for about 10 minutes before he walked off i have a really explosive temper. But after that i was thinking about cutting his throat. I think about vulgar stuff i know is wrong. I think about killing people daily, cutting their throats, hanging them by hooks, literally cereal killer stuff.

And of course the fact that cramming is far easier a task with the way my brain works.

"ED cat cafe? TL;DR at the end.

I've had this idea for awhile now and have been trying to reach out to reddit/tumblr/kik about the opinions of ED sufferers on the concept of a cat cafe that served ""ED friendly"" food; however I am also worried about potential negative effects of having ""readily available super low cal"" food may have on sufferers. I have been in and out of recovery for anorexia with bulimic cognitions since I was 10 years old, and over the years have amassed many tasty recipes at all the stages of my eating disorder; to help encourage recovery, I would break the menu into 3 sections: 1) lowest possible cal, 2) medium cal, 3) ""normal"" cals for that dish.

The ""cat"" specific part is because I love cats, but also to hopefully give people a calming/""therapeutic"" space, and possibly give people ""a reason"" to go to a place that serves ED friendly food.

One response I got said that it would be beneficial to not market the cafe as an ""ED"" cafe, because it may essentially ""out"" someone. Personally, with the intention of the cafe being to help sufferers, I think it would be more impactful if it was marketed as such, but I also don't know if that *actually* is more helpful.

Another helpful response suggested  engaging the patrons to help them build a sense of community/support, but I have no ideas on how to do that, or what to do.

"Really confused and doubting whether I have ADHD Little background info: throughout high school I got As and Bs but I had to sacrifice my social life since my senior years were very stressful. I am very shy and I suspect I may have anxiety.

So last week I went to see a psychiatrist at my Uni's clinic and get checked for ADHD. The psychiatrist barely asked any questions related to ADHD and prescribed me Dexedrine within 20 mins.

I shrugged it off and decided to not buy the prescription since I was skeptical. Yesterday, I went into shoppers drug Mart(canada) and bought dexedrine (60 capsules for $100). 

I tried 10mg yesterday and I had severe headaches and neck pains throughout the day. I assumed it was just my body getting used to the meds so decided to try it again today. But today, the headaches and neck pains were unbearable to the point I couldn't even do any of my assignments or even sit in one place. I had a big breakfast, had a protein heavy lunch and drank water throughout the day.

I feel like my thoughts are jumping even more on the meds which made me decide not to take them again. It's 4am and I still can't go to sleep either. I'm starting to think I was way better off without the meds.

So my question is if I really do have ADHD and what do I do with the remainder of the 58 dexedrine capsules?

I can talk to him about everything else and he is completely rational and logical, but soon as I ask him about why he thinks he is in the hospital he starts with those delusional stories. I would understand if he lost touch with reality completely, but how is it possible that he can be 100% rational in some things and 100% delusional in other things? Can anyone explain this to me? How does it feel like to have delusions? Why is he unable to use his rational mind to say to himself that this thing I am paranoid about seems little illogical.

"Got called out by my bus driver I have to take the bus and train to school. And today on my way home, the bus was a bit crowded, but there were plenty of seats left. So I left my backpack on the seat next to me. 

It wasn’t just to keep people from sitting next to me but also for comfort. The seats in the bus are way too small to have a backpack at your feet. If someone would’ve asked me to move the backpack I would’ve! And if there were less seats still left, I would’ve removed my backpack too, since it’s the polite thing to do.

When I got off of the bus, the driver called out to me that I have to lay my backpack down next time it’s so crowded. I pointed out that there were at least 10 seats still empty and that I would’ve if someone had asked. He answered that not everyone likes to ask. 

Which is a fair point, I too don’t like asking stuff. I mumbled that I don’t like having people in my space and then proceeded to get off the bus.

"Highschool grad, odd behavior? Howdy yall,

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, graduated highschool a few weeks ago. Never really drank alot, usually a 40/60 split between at home listening to music and chilling at parties. Had a few drinks the night before graduation, as a sort of celebration? Then after that, holy shit. The parties! Probably a solid 12 in the past three weeks, at them i'll have maybe 6ish drinks, sometimes more. However, other then a 5 day break a few days ago, i've been having a few drinks every night. Not enough to get shitfaced or even drunk, just maybe 4ish? Just for a nice buzz. Today I woke up with a headache and just felt really stupid, kinda in a daze? I guess my main question is, is it normal to go on a bit of a bender after graduation? After today I'm completely done with this bender, the headache and daze really sold me on how horrible alcohol is for you.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Coming across my abuser online I struggled with severe PTSD after I was raped by my best friend in 2016. This was someone who had been in my life since we were 8. I feel as though I have been able to work past my PTSD in many ways, the anxiety that comes with the thought or sight of him is crippling.

Two days ago he had popped up on my suggestions on Facebook. I was shocked, I’ve had him blocked online for years now, but it seems he’s made a new Facebook. I got sick to my stomach, seeing his face again made me angry. I felt like I could’ve exploded. I live in constant fear in the back of my mind after coming in contact with anything that triggers a memory of him. 

Today my mom was able to access my old laptop from highschool. I knew for a fact it is FILLED with pictures of him. I tried to quickly and mindlessly delete a lot.... but during that time we were incredibly close and hung out several times a week / took probably hundreds of pictures of our dumb adventures. 

I feel like I’ve been sliding back into a place where I’m scared. Scared of thinking about my rape, scared I won’t be able to sleep again, scared I’m going to get so anxious I’ll detach myself from the rest of the world.

My mother had come across some of us too, she knows I was raped but from her comments today I don’t think she ever knew exactly who did it, or maybe she forgot... I know I like to live like I have. 

I got upset, and told her I’m deleting them. 

I feel like no matter how many pictures I’ve burned, conversations I deleted, years I spent trying to avoid him, that he always haunts me from time to time.

I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone about this. I feel like if I sit in front of someone and tell them how I feel I’m going to fall apart. I get angry, because I feel like he still has control over my emotions. I like to live like it never happened 99 out of 100 days. I like to act like it wasn’t my best friend who raped me on the 1 day I do acknowledge being a survivor of sexual assault.


How do you guys manage triggers? What can I do on my end to truly work at not falling back into such a crippling state? I can’t afford therapy right now.... I have hundreds of dollars in bills from previous therapy sessions this year. I was charging my credit card more recently to pay for the most recent set of sessions, then my therapist didn’t have the availability to see me anymore. 

I’m feeling so alone in my head, I’m sitting in my room feeling like his sitting in my kitchen right next to that laptop with all the pictures of us. I get so sick to my stomach, for being so close to someone who traumatized me and did something so terrible to me.

Its impossible for me to just sit there and do nothing for me its worse than torture (cant split up the classes either its 4-6 hours or nothing) so basically im thinking about dropping out of college because for me its impossible to do this even with meds i am currently in college for cisco networking but will pretty much take any IT jobs because i love working with computers and time just flies by no matter what im doing on it

I had never considered it before, and it would make sense. I still have dreams about my ex where i tell him im happy and i've moved on, and he reacts in the dream by threatening to kill me or my current boyfriend. My ex had red hair, and every time i see someone with red hair i freak out a bit and have to tell myself multiple times that its not him. I cant speak to any of my loved ones or anyone who knew him about our relationship or about how it ended without breaking down. I cant speak to anyone who has the same name as him. My best friend inherited his cat, and i also cant be around the cat and actively get angry at her when shes near me. I've blocked out some memories from the night everything changed too. I constantly think about and relive that night and the few days that came after.

Anyway, now that its come to my attention that i most likely have PTSD, i'm having a very difficult time going about my daily tasks like i did before my diagnosis. I cried in a lecture at school yesterday because it was about suffering. Right now im laying in bed and i just want to lay here all day but i cant because its almost the end of my semester and everything is due by the end of next week.

"In need of guidance. I am a 28 year old male who has suffered with severe PTSD since I have been a child. My father was an abusive alcoholic. My parents had always told me that mental illness was not a real thing and that I had to ""suck it up."" My dad would come home from work, check my mother's shopping receipts, and then direct his angry tirade at me. Mental, physical and verbal abuse. He would constantly compare me to my friends and tell me that I was not up to par, regardless of me being super advanced in my studies. He had been taken away by the police for punching me in the face repeatedly, but I dropped the charges due to feeling guilt that I would be the reason my own father would be in jail. My home was infested with fleas, and I didn't have a proper bed until I purchased one myself when I was 16 years old. There was never a meal cooked for me to eat when i got home from school. Even to this day, my father tells me that I needed to be beaten. He has rejected any wrongdoing to me in my life and still to this current day blames me for the disability that he has caused in my life. They even allowed the family dog to pass away due to neglect (being eaten alive from the inside by maggots.)  Due to this, at age 28, I still have not had an official diagnosis. My PTSD has been so bad that I cannot maintain a job due to having severe mental breakdowns. The longest I have been able to work was a 6 month stretch where I had a job as a delivery driver. I am in great physical shape due to using the gym as one of my outlets in trying to cure my PTSD, but mentally I have always been extremely weak and fragile. Due to this, my father has deemed me as lazy, stating that I am ""able bodied"" and should be able to tough it out. I have a strong will to be normal and functional, and I wish very deeply every day that I could rid myself of the plague in my mind that brings me back to the panic and fear that forces me to stay inside and miss out on living.   


  
The largest problem in my life is that due to the fact that the people around me have neglected to accept that I have a severe disability, I cannot be free from it. I am 28 years old, possessing many skills and talents, but still living at home unable to make it longer than a couple months holding a job down before I mentally go off the rails and break down. I truly feel as if my mind is a prison and there is no way to escape. Living with my abusers who still deny my condition has made it feel almost impossible to make anything happen in my life, and suicide often crosses my mind due to feeling helpless. I feel as though no matter what I would never act on these thoughts, but some days it feels as though it would be the best option so that I no longer have to suffer. I have tried to contact other family members, but they all just treat me as though I am a burden and I am a problem. I do not wish to be a burden or a problem to anyone. I wish to be able to be free of my abusers and free from the torment that is inside of my mind from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep.   


I do not have any money, nor medical insurance, and I have nobody to reach out to. My peers have no idea what I have struggled with my entire life, because I have done a great job of covering up what I deal with due to feeling ashamed of myself. I hold myself back from making new connections with people due to feeling embarassed of my situation in life. I have tried to work in order to remove myself from this living condition, hoping that if I escape the house that my abusers live in, that I will be free from the mental torment, but as soon as I get to the point mentally where I feel as though I am able to make it through, my father will say or do something to derail my life. He does not understand that he has severely damaged me due to the abuse he put me through as a child. When I try to tell him what he has done, he says ""you don't know what being beat means,"" or ""other people have had it much worse."" instead of acknowledging what he did to me. I cannot go a week without having flashbacks to him holding me down and beating me.   


I truly need to escape this home because every day longer that I live here is one day longer that I feel as though there is no end in sight. I am a good looking man, so I have never had a problem finding a relationship with a woman, but every time I find someone that I love, my disability destroys what I have spent so much time building.   


I have found that cannabis helps me cope with the past and the issues that still haunt me today, but I get called a drug addict by my father and threatened to be kicked out to the street if I bring it into his home.   


In the past I have abused alcohol and prescription pills as a way to try and combat my mental illness. I recognized that those were just creating more problems for me, and I have not drank alcohol or done any prescription drugs in 3 years. I do not wish to take any psychiatric drugs because I feel as though they numb the person that I am inside, and I live my life 100% clean from all substance other than cannabis.   


I feel as though I have an entire life to live, but I am trapped in a prison cell to watch everyone else around me succeed and get to do all of the things I have always dreamed of doing while I waste day after day after day with no end in sight. I have cried and begged for help from my parents but they offer no solution. My extended family has written me off as crazy, despite never being around to witness what I have dealt with.   


I am at the lowest point I believe that I have been at in my life to date, and I am having a very hard time seeing an end. 

My credit history is bad, so I can't buy or rent a vehicle, let alone a home.   
I have an actual net worth of 0$ at age 28, and I am unable to leave the home that the abuse still haunts me in, with the people who still abuse me. 

I feel as though even despite my repeated outcries to my parents for help, they neglect me, or make me feel as though I am an extreme burden on them. This only makes me feel worse, because I do not want anyone to have to take care of me.

My only wish is to be able to escape this and to be able to take care of myself so that someday I may be able to have a wife and children.   


I do not have any idea where to start and I feel truly hopeless. If anyone can offer any suggestions, it would be of great help. I am so damaged mentally that I genuinely feel as though I can't even take the initiative to try to help myself anymore. I feel as though my willpower is at it's end and I can't fight this alone anymore.  


I do not want psychiatric help. I want to conquer this without being forced to take prescription medications. I strongly believe that my problems would be much less magnified if I were living away from the people who abused and neglected me.   


I am not looking for pity. I am looking for guidance from someone who has dealt with a similar situation, and to see if there is any option available for me to escape this neverending trap. Are there any programs that exist to help someone like me?",ptsd,ptsd

"Coming to terms with PTSD in a relationship TW: Rape, Abuse TW: rape and abuse

So I've recently started to come to terms with the idea of having PTSD. 
I've been having a hard time the last few years financially and mental health wise. Things just sort of exploded my second semester of my first year of uni. So I'm finally seeing a psychiatrist and getting help to get to a mental space that is healthy enough to deal with the trauma. However, I'm having a ""It gets worse before it gets better"" reaction to addressing and identifying my trauma. I guess because my trauma is based around my experiences of emotional, physical, and psycho-sexual abuse from my father and an incident of rape a couple of years ago, it's being triggered around men and my boyfriend in particular. 

My boyfriend has been wonderful and patient and does his best when it comes to my depression and anxiety. But he has trouble remembering or knowing how to react when it comes to PTSD related things.

I guess I need advise on how to talk to my boyfriend about it and how to approach it. He wants to be supportive but I still don't know all the triggers or how to deal with my responses to them like I do my anxiety and depression so I'm having trouble letting him in or guiding him. ",ptsd,ptsd

"How significant is the impact of Binge-drinking actually on the brain? As someone who is 21 and has recently quit drinking entirely i have been drinking quite heavily since my 18.   
With quite heavily i imply not necessarily frequent(though at times this was the case) but rather intensively to a degree one would call severe binge drinking. 

I cut down considerably since the beginning of 2017 having started drinking since the beginning of 2015. During this time a friend and i always got rather happy-drunk and did stuff that at the time others didn't really partake in(just overall funny stories and getting drunk whilst others refrained from doing so, only drinking regularly as was the social standard). 

I've been having mental issues since as long as i can remember but this last year they got considerably worse with paranoia being occasionally thrown in the mix pushing me to drink even more out of fear 'i wasn't drunk enough to act likeable'. 

In order to not deviate too much from the point: every year there is this festival at the beginning of the summer-vacation during which on the first night(of 5) i somehow get extremely hammered to a point i get very sick the following day. Weirdly enough i don't seem to be drunk to a degree i can't walk or straight up black out though i can't recall anything but vague flashes of what the evening remotely looked like.   
The following day however i have the most brutal headache and am straight up sick: i am not able to throw up a lot though after getting a bit out of my system i threw up that yellowish/green-sap(don't exactly know the precise translation in English). I am worried since i didn't vomit during the night(i am not certain if i smoked weed alongside the alcohol). 

I remember being very tired and having to breathe very intensely because i felt that bad.

To give a little backstory, i have level 2 autism, intelectual disabilty with dyslexia and a language disabilty, adhd and ptsd, fibromyalgia and lymes disease, kidney and liver disease, and pcos. I have a lot of health issues. I have even more that stem off of the health issues (being caused by them) like depression, anxiety, agoraphobia, ocd, sensory processing disorder, auditory processing disorder, panic attacks/meltdowns, and paranoia with hallucinations/flashbacks. I use to have a heart disease but I literally grew into my heart. It was enlarged due to a genetic mutation. Im really the first person in my family to have all these health issues and be special needs, so my doctors have thought about getting a genetics test done. But anyway, i thought id get a backstory about my health issues as to why i struggle so much because they all kind of tie together and make especially my autism hard to deal with.

With all that said, the past 9 months have been a messy ride.

But also in the last 9 months i have not been able to adjust to the sitaution im in. My oldest brother and his kids moved in with my mom and me. We live in a 2 bedroom trailer with two dogs. I have not had my room or bed since September....its almost July now. I have been having a lot of meltdowns becauae i havent been sleeping much. I also dont have my own space to go to when im overwelmed. Im not violent towards others when i have meltdowns. I hurt myself more but i also demand for my problems to be fixed but by that point, all rationality goes out the window, so I argue against all help. I know it makes it hard to deal with me when i have meltdowns. Ive also had a few moments where ive gotten suicidal, but im working with all of my therapists to get help with other options that doesnt require actual hospitalization becauae i spent 5 months in the hospital between 2014 and 2015 for two suicide attempts and it was more traumatizing than anything. Im not deathly afraid of anything except for my mom dying, bees, and being hospitalized in a psych ward.

"Finally seeking treatment, but my girlfriend says I’m vain if I feel like my biggest issue is my eating 🙃 Hey guys,

I’ve lurked on here for awhile, but never felt the need to post until recently. I guess the signs were all there that I had a problem with eating, but I’ve been reluctant to say that I might have an eating disorder. 

As if thinking about food 24/7 is normal, as if binging nearly every night around 2000+ calories is normal, as if feeling guilty and shitty and out of control is normal. I don’t know. I was scared to get help. 

I mentioned to my partner at one point I thought I might have something like BED. Everything points to it, from my long history of dieting, to my nightly sessions, to my attempts to help myself or stop which never work out long term. She told me to stop diagnosing myself and see someone for real. 

I was really reluctant to get help at first. My last therapist wasn’t very good, and I was never comfortable enough to disclose my eating issues since they’ve been a constant source of shame. Plus, I went off my medication a while back and was anxious they’d be upset with me. 

Yesterday, I finally set up an appointment. Different therapist and I was upfront that the eating issues played a huge role in why I wasn’t doing so hot. I was over the moon thinking that something I’ve struggled with for years might get the help it needed. I told my partner about it and she was proud too. Until I told her my main reason was the eating. 

She told me I was vain for focusing on that when I have depression and anxiety. That I’m scared of driving as an adult and *that* was my problem. That should be a priority for me and not the eating issues. That I had already looked up all the symptoms online to “tell them exactly what they wanna hear to diagnose you”. And that my eating habits “weren’t even that bad, you just crash diet and then wonder why you end up overeating all the time”. The worst is that she called me a monster whose vain and obsessed with looking skinny, so much that it’s preventing me from actually getting help for my “real problems”. 

I’m so heartbroken. I’ve spent my whole life feeling ruined by my weight and my relationships with food. I binge no matter what kind of meal plans I try. Healthy ones, ones that meet my calorie recommendations. 3x a day or just 1. Counting calories, or just letting loose. I binge every time. She knows this. I lament about it a lot. She just says I have no impulse control and struggle with crash dieting. 

Now it seems like she won’t believe me even if they were to diagnose. She’s ready to write me off and the impact it plays in my life. Now I’m second guessing. Maybe I’m focusing on the wrong things. Maybe I’m wasting time and money. I just... I don’t know who to turn to for support. I just want to be a healthy weight for the first time in my life. I can’t live the rest of myself resenting myself for my eating and appearance.

"I'm very tired of never knowing when I'm going to upset people (or why) This is my first post here so I'm sorry if venting is not allowed. I'm autistic and ADHD and have related auditory processing problems (among other things). I feel like I am constantly saying things that seem innocuous to me but end up upsetting people. Often I blame my auditory processing issues. I have a hard time seperating speech from background noise (it feels like everyone is constantly muttering or whispering). So I can often chalk it up to my not having understood what they were trying to say and responding ""wrong."" 

But other times, such as when talking to someone via text, I'll read what they said, type out what I think is an appropriate response, only to have them respond in a very negative way, accusing me of having said things I didn't and being very upset. In those cases I just get confused. I've found trying to clarify myself almost never helps once someone is upset (defending yourself when somebody else is upset is wrong I've learned). I hate having to apologize for things I didn't actually say, so I end up coming across as mean and stubborn.

I applied for disability employment services because of my epilepsy. My mom used the letter that the doctor who diagnosed me wrote for something back in 2016 that helped me get approved for services.

"Lowering medication dosage. Just wondering what other peoples experience is. I went from highest to moderate and feel as though I have  ADHD lite ( or diet ADHD, 0 cal ADHD, reduced sodium ADHD, etc....any clever way of saying a more mild, less threatening version) about two months ago. I was hoping that my body would adjust and moderate dosage would work as well as highest...but that hasn't been the case yet. I was just wondering if anyone noticed big differences when they tried lowering dosage and if it evened out eventually. For reference, I gave 2 examples below of changes I've noticed. 

Examples: 
 Me with full dose:  can be an active participant in group conversation. Without meds:  I am only engaged when spoken to directly or I sense the convo is about to end so I chime in so people don't notice I spaced out 5 min ago. With lower dosage:  I catch myself spacing out and can easily re-enter conversation. 

Me with full dose: I ask a question and hear/remember the response 95% of the time. Without meds: I forgot or can't remember if I asked question in the first place and definitely can't remember response. With lower dosage: I recognize I asked question already and realize I didn't pay attention to response, so I apologize and ask again. 

So benefits of lowering dosage are less impact on BP, easier on me on days I don't take meds, and less anxious. Downside being....I know it could be better. Thinking I may just go back to higher dosage at next doc visit.",adhd,adhd

"Told my boyfriend about my binge/purge ED (regret) I told my boyfriend a few weeks ago that I have a binge eating disorder and he told me “well then don’t...” and didn’t take me seriously. I brought the subject up again tonight because he thinks I’m on a diet. I went to grab a snack (cheese balls) and he stared at me and said “so you’re just giving up on your diet?” I ignored him and continued snacking. He seemed annoyed and kept giving me a glare so I started feeling like shit and put the snack away. I then gave him an attitude and said I was going to take a shower. I purged in the shower and felt bad about giving him an attitude so I asked him if we could talk. I started off with an apology and continued to say “I have a binge eating disorder..” he then said “well people that know they have an eating disorder can fix it” I told him that isn’t entirely true...I thought it was an ignorant thing to say. I went on about how I am constantly battling with my urges and my body and began crying. He stayed quiet for a few minutes so I began to feel embarrassed (I’ve never told anyone before). 

I turned away and apologized for bringing it up. He then got extremely angry and said “so you’re just gonna go back to having an attitude? What about your apology?” I then replied “I’m not having an attitude I’m just embarrassed and I’m genuinely sorry for burdening you with my problem” I really wasn’t trying to have an attitude and I feel like he’s making this about himself by constantly back tracking to me having an “attitude”. 

I apologized again for having and attitude but that it wasn’t intentional. He then asked me “so what’re you gonna do about your ED?” I said “idk that’s why I was crying out to you for some help or advice but I’m sorry for bringing it up” he then yells at me again saying I’m still having an attitude.

A few weeks ago, I had a heart to heart with one of my bosses. I'm on the spectrum, and some of the people I was working with had just been butting heads. Things were unclear, and they don't do conflict conversations very well.  

It caused problems, the job was ending. But I didn't tell them I was on the spectrum because there were some slanderous things said by team members. Half joking, off-collar, the kind of stuff we hate. It didn't need to be really bad &lt;fill in your own example&gt; for it to be an unsafe, unwelcome and unwanted environment. Just happened that fast. 

But then they started talking about trying to hire people on the spectrum, not knowing that here I was, with the condition they thought would be helpful. It's a software shop, so it makes sense. But then I had to tell them that no, you shouldn't actually do that. Because I'm autistic, and you guys are terrible to work with for someone on the spectrum and here's why. (mostly communication). 

And most people still think autism has to do with lacking empathy, or an ability to connect with others (seems I have the opposite problem, if so.) 

And my boss then tells me that his child has autism. And in that brief moment, I went from feeling alone to feeling understood. 

Many close friends of mine don't know because I didn't find out till later in life and it never came up. They just say ""That's Fred, being Fred."" or as my Mom used to say ""I have a Frank!""

I called the front desk and they confirmed the incorrect script date and that they would bring it up when the doc gets in. But, ultimately, unless I take a day off from work and drive out to physically collect the new script, I have to wait ~2-3 days for it to arrive by mail. 

So, what am I in for? My main concern is not so much returning ADHD symptoms, I managed them until I was 32, it’s the sleepiness and grogginess. I’ve only taken it for a few months, 20 mg in the morning, then 20 at noon. 

UPDATE: Doc just called me personally and is overnighting a new RX to my home address. So that means I’ll only have to suffer through tomorrow at work. Today’s half done, and I’ll just take it easy tonight, thank you everyone for your responses.  ",adhd,adhd
"Feeling ego-death and having chills, then having delusions. Anyone? How does psychosis feel qualitatively for you? (My experience) I was sitting in the library, I felt something like ""Ego-death"" (A buddhist concept I'm familiar with, and something I read about after) which feels like you disappear and just spread out. I felt like just sitting there frozen and staring. Then I started thinking about a worm reaching into my brain, and the long white lights on the ceiling were also worms, and the world was going to end ... 

and the sickly swimming, bright green mental 'background' in my mind starting swimming and becoming active. I felt the 'void' alien presence, growing in my mind, going to take me over.
Does anyone know about the 'void', alien presence thing? What's up with that? Who is it and what's it gonna do huh?

Also ... I've been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (or something) ... then told I was mis-diagnosed , then ... this kinda shit keeps happening. ya know.

"Scared Of Using Alcohol Like My Mother and Grandmother Had I grew up witnessing female figures in my life abuse alcohol to subdue unwanted feelings. Mostly my mother. In the last year she had an episode of relapse that shook me to my core. My grandmother died of due to her alcoholism that took priority over her medical issues. I’ve been fearful of drinking since I was a teenager because I never wanted to end up like that. However,  I did struggle with a cutting issue in college and high school. Firstly when my uncle hung himself, then my cousin drowned himself using cinder blocks. In college I cut awhile after my church friend committed suicide just a dorm away. I’ve stopped that and have transformed my life since. I had a really a bad breakup around that time. I’ve traveled around Europe, southern U.S, moved around and settled in south western Arkansas, 25 hours from my original home. I have an amazing boyfriend and nice apartment. I want to marry him and have a family. I’ve never been happier with someone. However, I’ve been dealing with things using alcohol. It started gradually after a long day. However, recently I’ve started graduate school and have not been getting call back for jobs. I feel like a failure, which I know I shouldn’t. I don’t want to cut anymore, so today after submitting a project incorrectly (which I know is minuscule) I tried hard not to cut and instead drank Vodka. My ancestor’s drink of choice.  I had to stop studying for school because of how hard it all hit me. I fight off alcohol cravings a bit so I’m still a “light weight” I suppose. I’m home alone most of the day, cooking, cleaning, applying for jobs and sewing the day a way. My insurance is going to end soon so I don’t think I can afford a therapist anymore. I love working, but been denied even a Home Depot Clerk job. I’ve been feeling like a failure and a loser when I’m sober recently. It’s all me. This has nothing to do with people around me or my family anymore. My mother has changed her life and is my biggest role model. I don’t have a lot of friends here yet so maybe I just need a wider support system. Does anyone have any advice? I’m scared to tell my mom what’s going on because you’d think I’ve learned from watching her drink herself to sleep and struggle during my childhood. I love my boyfriend so much as well and don’t want to mess this up. He had a very similar situation with his own mother. We have such a cute little family with my dog. It’s the morning time and I’m hoping this intoxicated feeling wears off by the afternoon when he gets home. I can’t keep a secret from him so I’ll probably tell him what happened.

Life isn’t awful. God is good. I just can’t figure out why I get so angry and depressed about my life. I love myself just hate where I am I guess? I want to contribute more to this world.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"I feel ashamed of my big stim! It's probably such a random one too.

But after some real young kids made a raging fit at me and threatend to actually harm me if I didn't get off the swings - also telling me I was ugly and smelt like fish which I don't??? (Note: they were not actually using the swings and didn't want to use them, just wanted me off them.) 

My mother has enforced a park ban on me because my stim was ""causing problems"" there are no age limits on the play equipment and I don't look at, talk to or interact with any kids while I'm there. No one else really took issue with me till the other day. 

She's also banned me from the aquarium, the arcade, build a bear and basically anywhere associated socially as for kids, because people might see my otherwise innocent 'zoning out'  behavior as...not innocent... which is a huge blow to me as animals and arcade games are some of my most favorite things. Half the time i'm so in my own bubble im not even noticing people around me of any specific age, older or younger than I am. I just end up focused on me and whatever animal/game/toy is in front of me-- I'm having a really difficult time understanding just why i'm not allowed to have fun at these places too. I don't really find drinking coffee and having conversations with adults..fun..which is apparently what I should be doing instead... I could do all these things when I was younger why do I have to stop-

Ugh i got so off track sorry! But really I'm also wondering if anyone has an alternative suggestion for the swings? Bearing in mind I'm not allowed to visibly rock if im sitting as my parents find it unacceptable for a grown up-

"Separation Anxiety: What It Is, And How To Combat It Hello everyone! Whilst browsing today, I came across a post talking about anxiety stemming from being away from a loved one (it's this one right here if any of you want to check it out or read the comments: https://old.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/c57jfy/do_any_of_you_find_it_hard_to_get_attached_to/ ) My response to this post would have been far too long, so I decided to make my own post. Before I begin, a quick disclaimer: I am not a medical or mental health professional. If you/a loved one are/is in distress, PLEASE seek professional help. Note also that this is geared towards adolescent and adult autistics, if any parents of autistic children want advice for separation anxiety in their own children I may make a second post specifically pertaining to children.

Now about Separation Anxiety. Most of you - if not all of you - know what it is. Anxiety and other sorts severe distress stemming from separation from an emotionally significant place, person, or thing. Usually seen in small children and dogs, it's not typically seen outside of childhood (especially early childhood), but when it is, it can be quite debilitating for the sufferer. As to why this is autism-relevant, it is relevant for the same reason depression and anxiety in general are relevant - because of common co-morbidity (which, by the way, is defined as medical conditions that occur simultaneously in a patient). Most autistics here can likely attest to at least some symptoms of depression or anxiety, if not have the disorders entirely, which is why a conversation about separation anxiety and autism is necessary to have. Thankfully, there are a variety of coping mechanisms available to sufferers (specifically autistic sufferers) that I will cover here. (Note also that these do not apply to everyone - please try them and find which ones work best for you!)

One very big way to cope is via breathing exercises. Being mindful about your breathing can help out a ton when you're anxious, and can help especially if you're just about, in, or recovering from a panic attack. Some common exercises involve timing your breaths, whether on 3, 4, or even 5 second intervals, or a mixture of the aforementioned. There are also handy gifs on the Internet you can look at and breathe along to if you find you have trouble keeping track of time on your own. The name of the game here is lowering your heart rate, which helps immensely with calming down. Another very major way is by self soothing, which, as is the case with Separation Anxiety proper, is also rather self-explanatory. You soothe the self. This ties in very heavily with stimming, though they are not the same thing. Basically, with this is that you want to seek out calming, pleasurable experiences - whether they be playing a game, going for a walk, smelling something nice, drinking something tasty, etc. The goal is to provide ample distraction for your anxious brain to concentrate on while you are separated from whatever it is you are attached to. In a similar vein, using CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) techniques can help too - forcing yourself to think opposite thoughts from any negative ones you are facing. This is highly variable, and the form it takes depends solely on you.

That selection of coping mechanisms is by no means exhaustive, and you can learn of many more by doing a bit of research. At any rate, now we've got you coping with the anxiety. Now to help either prevent it or make it so it is not as intense the next time there is separation. One method that worked for me is gradual controlled separation - not unlike exposure therapy for treating phobias. Basically, you gradually spend more and more time away from the attachment in a controlled way, until the anxiety gets to a good and manageable level or it becomes negligible. Another way to manage anxiety for future events is (if the attachment is a person) talk to them and schedule occasional check-ins with them to assure you that they are indeed fine and that you are fine and that everything is okay. Hopefully, that helps with mitigation prior to stressful events!

Aaaand, done! Phew, now that was a doozy. Very long, and it still was a wall of text. Oh well, this topic isn't exactly light reading on its own anyway. At any rate, I hope this helped some of you struggling with Separation Anxiety. Again, a lot of this is extremely variable and each of you are going to have to do some soul-searching and experimentation to see what works for you, but this is basically me providing a bit of insight to a problem a lot of us have. Thank you for reading, and I hope you all have a wonderful day!",autism,autism

"Leftover symptoms of PTSD years after being cured in therapy First time posting so trigger warnings might be unneeded, adding them to be sure. 

TW: Violence, Racism (sadly) and Sexism (also sadly), Ridicule

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old white man and have been treated for acute PTSD 3 years due to several violent encounters on the street. At the time these encounters made me radically racist, and very sexist as well, (policewomen didn't intervene and just walked past), large parts of my day and of my energy where expended in revenge fantasies. The good news was that I managed to get therapy after I realized my behavior was not healthy, picked up some healthy hobbies to channel my anger and was cured, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week a colleague of mine was pestering me, no big deal, I can take this when its from friends. But it was different. The moment he touched me, normally this is not a problem, I got extremely angry. I got physical with him, and considered doing something that would definitely have landed me in jail. Of course the fucknut also just had to say I was ""triggered"", (I was, but we're not speaking English, the word ""triggered"" is just known because of memes surrounding PTSD and only used mockingly.) After this, my symptoms have come back, albeit in a milder form. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate what my PTSD has made me, I used to be a sweet, albeit dorky guy. While the racism and sexism is not as bad as it was before, some days I still feel filled to the brim with hatred for these people. But worst of all are the violent fantasies. They are very, very, extreme and sometimes I'm left ruminating for almost 30 minutes.

"Watching ted talks is not helping. Had enough therapy to know whats my responsibility now. How did these ted talk crew take their trauma and turn into nice people with useful lives? Tldr is what do i do if **I** am the cause of lots of my current situation? 

I don’t blame my current events on the past. I get that I was damaged in the past and have worked for two decades to minimise that and be a useful stable person. 

I have failed overall. 

Not entirely, I get that. I dont drink, I work in a service industry, I am superficially a good member of society. So my lil ted talk would be “I was expected to be dead or a selfabsorbed addict or fully mental and im not”. 

Instead I am a partially functioning human who cannot sustain a relationship nor run a house. I live alone with multiple reminders to shower and do housework. I have 3-6 year relationships which end because I am “too much”.  

I have no career but work parttime in an entry level nursing because Im good at it but also live paycheck to paycheck. And Im grateful for my work. 

I guess my self-pity party is about how do these ted talk crew overcome their traumas to the point of support and success? And why have I not met my basic values of being a stable enjoyable life companion for someone, with a quiet social function and peaceful uplifting community presence?

"The new mission They label it
Diagnose it
Treat it
It makes it worse

3 tours in Iraq, tortured, drowned to death and resuscitate. I fond memories of, a cherished blur of adrenaline.

But it's not real.
We chase that numbness, that elusive shadow of something you can't name.

Escaping into it becomes a daily response mechanism to conflict. Drowning out the outside noise with the noise inside our heads.

But it's not real.
Your family is real, your friends are real, your future is real; you are real.

We approach issues as problems and launch missions. We push forward to win the fight; but it's not a fight; there is no battle outside, only one within.

The new mission isn't one of conflict. It's a mission of serenity, patience, and love.
If you are struggling, just let go. Your life is your karma and you have a lot more to give.

If you are reading this, stop what you are doing, stop what you are thinking. Make your loved ones feel important. 
Your wife should wake up to a path of flowers leading to a card thanking her for everything she's done. 
Your kids should enjoy a breakfast out where you leave your phone in the car, or even at home.
They are real, they are important.

I live in a glass house and see my family two days a week, I stayed in the blur for too long.
Things aren't too late to change until they are.
The new mission is love.

"Dating experiments: a report on the latest failure So... you know the thing where you get way over invested for about a month and then completely forget about them? I do that, a lot. 

So I came up with this plan. In hindsight I’m not sure why I ever thought it would work. It seemed like a good idea at the time. 

It goes like this:

If I date someone I’m not interested in, I won’t obsess. If I don’t obsess I won’t get bored, if I don’t get bored I won’t forget about them. Voila, problem solved. 

I would be the guiding light of relationship pros! The expert! The bestest!

Turns out that if you’re already bored with them before you start dating them then you remain bored of them. It doesn’t go away. All that happens is you accidentally unintentionally string them along and then have to come up with some way to explain to them that it’s not working. 

Which brings me to my next problem: I have a very vague grasp over my brain mouth filter. If he asks why I don’t think it’ll work, currently all I’ve got is ‘I just find you boring’. I can’t say that to him. I just can’t. I might have to date him for eternity just to avoid it. 

So, yeah. Psa: finding them boring from the start doesn’t stop you finding them boring later. Also: how do I ditch him without hurting him??

"Difficulty at current job, need some advice please. Hi!

I currently work as an Emergency Medical Technician in NYC. I started out as Full-Time, but I've dropped all the way down to 1 12 Hour Shift per week.

"I feel unsure and like I'm making things up I have just now began to entertain the idea of possibly having psychosis/ schizophrenia. But I feel like since I have a lot of insight and my hallucinations and few and far between, that I'm making it all up?

Like, maybe I just want attention or to have a ""real"" diagnosis (I currently am in the hospital for depression, and have been since March. Which feels like a ""not-real"" diagnosis because it's not able to be seen.)

A couple of years ago I believed there were shadow people following me, and I didn't leave my house until I was forced to by my mom, and came back home when she recognized I was having a breakdown. I didn't tell anyone about the shadow people, and ripped up and destroyed the drawings and writing I made about all that. Because I think I made it up for attention or something? Maybe to make myself feel better or special? I also can't remember this time very well.

And sometimes I hear voices, like people talking in a diner, or someone calling my name. Usually when it's quiet. I feel like my brain is just trying to fill the silence though. And I recognize that it's not real. And it doesn't happen super often.

I also have periods of time that I believe I'm in hell/purgatory. Or that I'm the only real person, or this is all a simulation or something. But most of the time I only kind of entertain the idea, I rarely- if ever- believe it fully. Just kind of.

Writing all this down, I honest to god think I'm doing this for attention or to have a real diagnosis. Maybe none of this is real. Maybe I'm doing this because my family might take me seriously now? I don't know.

I **will** tell my doctor, and I brought up a very little portion of this to my therapist, but I want to know what you guys think? And please, please consider that I'm lying or something. Or making it up. Not maliciously, but I really can't believe that this is real. I don't fucking know.

"[F, 22] Delayed onset PTSD due to possible past sexual assault experiences. I'm confused. Please help. These are my past experiences which I think is and is close to sexual assault:

● I was in my teens (high school) when this happened. I was in the living room with my mom, dad, and sister. We were hanging out when suddenly my dad decided he wanted to touch my genital. I moved away because I felt uncomfortable, but he kept on reaching for it and he was eventually able to touch it. I felt violated, but they were laughing, including my mom so I dismissed the feeling. Please, don't misunderstand. My father is a bit emotionally and mentally abusive, but he never tried to abuse me sexually except for instances like I mentioned.

● This happened when I was in college. It was late and there were no seats left, so I had no choice but to stand up in the bus so I could go home. I felt something hard on my rear, which I didn't quite pay attention to due to the bus being so crowded. I thought it was a belt or a bag, but then my friend (who was standing as well) suddenly pulled me closer to her and told me the guy behind me was rubbing his crotch on my back. The shocking thing is I laughed because I thought it was funny. When I arrived home, that's when I realized that what happened wasn't normal. I suddenly felt cold and mad at myself for reacting that way.

● I was still in college and these happened while I was in a relationship with my now ex-boyfriend. He had quite a few exes, but he was my first so I relied on him about relationship matters because I admit I was still quite naive. I also told him about the things I mentioned above. Before we did anything sexual, I already told him I will only allow us to go 'til second base and he agreed.

When we had our first intimate encounter, he was really respectful of my boundaries. But as time went by, he became really pushy. He would force to undress me when I don't want to. I have self-esteem issues and I want to open up to him little by little, but he doesn't seem to care about my discomfort and only cares about his own pleasure.

He also kept on convincing me to give him a blowjob. I told him I don't want to do it, but he just didn't stop on convincing me until I finally gave in. Our entire relationship almost revolved around me giving him blowjobs everytime we meet since then. I felt like he was treating me like an object, so I told him I really wanted to spend quality time with him (sitting in the couch and watching movies, talking about random things, getting to know each other more, stuff like that). He often agreed, but it always led to something sexual.

There was also a time when we were making out and he tried to finger me. I didn't want him to do it so I held his hand in order to stop him, but he kept on pushing my hand away. He eventually did what he wanted to do. I complained about it being painful, but he kept on doing it so I just let him because I felt like even if I refused, it won't matter anyway.

He also tried to give me oral sex. I'm not comfortable with it, so I refused. I said no twice and held his hand, but he kept on lowering my jeans. I wanted to cry, but I stopped myself because we were at his room and his parents were at the living room so I don't want to make a scene because it would be so embarrassing if they found out what we were doing. When I felt his lips on my genital, I felt cold. I froze. He still kept on touching and kissing me, but I never felt any pleasure from it. It's like I was there but I wasn't. I could remember giving him a blowjob and me hitting my head on the wall and almost gagging because he was being too rough. I also heard him say something like, ""I would've cum into your mouth, but I felt pity on you."" with a smug look on his face. I think this is because we agreed that he wouldn't cum in my mouth because I don't want to. I just felt numb the rest of the day while I was with him. When I arrived home, that's when it sank in. I told him through text that I felt disrespected, and he said sorry. He told me he just got carried away and he won't do it again. But after that event, there were times when he'd try to touch me and I'd push his hand away but like what he did before, he'd disregard my refusal.

There were a lot of times when I was aroused by what he was doing even if I don't want it. And I feel like it's my fault because I let him get his way when I could've fought and resisted more. I could've set my boundaries clearer. I'm really confused. I feel light-headed. I want to go into details more but this is already too long. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to feel.

"I’m missing 10 days worth of my 70mg Vyvanse, and I’m scared of withdrawal. Alright, I’m a little paranoid here. 

I should have 10 pills left. I never double dosed. I called my doctor, she said she can’t fill it again before the month is up without a letter from my pharmacy stating that they miscounted. 

That being said, I happen to work as management at my pharmacy, but not in the pharmacy itself. I talked to my pharmacist and she checked inventory counts - apparently they have exactly the amount they should, meaning they didn’t have any extra and didn’t miscount.

"TW. Ed stuff. So I'm ranting. I may go into different topics.. 


My best friend who got me into smoking pot and munchies has left. I was almost scared that it would never end and that I may be recovering, with the influence of pot of course. 
I had such a hard time because I was not recovering, it was like an excuse to get fat and eat... I could never escape hanging out with my friend. And all we would do is smoke and eat and talk. Worst moments of my life. I know terrible of me to say.

When we weren't together I wouldn't eat at all.. only when I had to(because parents) and no one knew about my restrictive behaviours and they still do not. I was beginning to think that I was going to get fat and never turn back. It was the scariest moment of my life.. I am actually at my highest weight now and i hate my friend for that.. especially for abandoning me after getting me fat.. i feel bad.. I can't shake it. I hate this!

Anyway. She left and idk if this is considered relapsing. I'm falling back into the same bad habits. But I have always had these disordered thoughts and habits even when it seemed like I was ""recovering/recovered."" 

I also started donating plasma more and they said my protein count was low, i felt proud but scared because i know what this means. 1.  won't be able to donate and 2. People might find out. 


I feel like I can never open up about my eating disorder with anyone ever because I've hid it for so long that no one would believe me.. my friend would say oh well you eat when we smoke all the time. Or my mom would say that she sees me eat and thinks I'm fat so I can't have an ED. I want to start recovery but I don't. Mostly because I have no support or validation.. and also because I'm not ready and dont feel sick enough.. 

Also I need to talk to my doctor about a hiatal hernia and acid reflux because they think it's the food I eat. But I barely eat and I want to open up about my eating disorder with this doctor to receive the right treatment for the hernia and GERD BUT I FEEL THEY WOULD FORCE ME INTO RECOVERY to start working on that problem..  I have read that eating disordered can be linked to these problems.. 

Also . I went on a date for the first time in a year and a half  I was fasting.. my stomach wouldn't stop growling.. I felt like my breath was stinky and I was tense.. I hate that I cant just recover and be able to eat and have a good time without these thoughts.. i really like this guy but I'm scared to open up about my problems and seem like a bag of sad bones... :( 

I'm not ready to recover but I'm having so many problems. 


What else... what else should I talk about?..

Guys how do you deal with being at your highest weight? I can't omg...

"How do I tell my closest female friend I’m autistic? Before I start I just want to say this is a complicated situation, but I break all the factors down in a list near the end to read after the first paragraph. Thank you!

How do I tell my closest female friend I’m autistic? This is a question that’s been plaguing me for months nearly ever since we met, and hit it off nearly immediately. We’re planning on meeting up sometime before the summer is over, but I don’t know whether to tell her before our meetup happens or if I should keep it to myself for a little longer. She’s a little older than me and she’s rather uneducated concerning what exactly autism is. She’s under the impression that it’s something you can just get over when it really isn’t in many cases. I’m afraid if I tell her she might leave me or not take our friendship seriously anymore. Me being younger than her already makes me a bit self-conscious, so being autistic doesn’t help either. On top of all this she’s my little brother’s best friend’s older sister, so if I lose her it’ll be even more devastating knowing she’s still connected to me in that way.


List of factors:

1. She’s older than me

2. She’s uneducated about what autism really is

3. We’re planning on meeting up soon

4. She’s the older sister to my little brother’s best friend

"Functional Alcoholic and Want to Stop This might sound privileged or conceited or maybe even pathetic. But I’ve never had a melt down moment. A lose my life if I don’t stop moment and I know if I continue this my life will be cut short by liver or kidney failure. I don’t drink at work, I don’t drink until I puke. But I drink... a lot.... - so much that hundreds of dollars are budgeted every month. I feel like shit all the time; tired, disinterested in sex; but able to make food and do laundry and chores. I’ve recently started gaining a lot of weight, I’ve gone from being able to be a model in an underwear campaign to a model for a weight loss drug.

Because I’ve never been in crisis and can live my life being drunk on evenings and weekends I don’t stop. I want to stop but I get so bored and lonely that it feels like the only panacea. And as a queer man, all the spaces for us are alcohol spaces. I can’t date or make friends without drinking it seems

I’ve tried AA (for sex addiction, but I feel like it would carry over) and it doesn’t work; all they talk about is their addiction and not how to get better; I don’t want to commiserate, I want to improve. I had a really great role model once for sex addiction until he developed a gaming dependency. Now I’ve gained weight, I spend hundreds of dollars on alcohol and I’m hating life because alcohol isn’t affecting my life enough to change but nearly every reason I’m unhappy is due to alcohol.

Knowing I’m personally resistant to AA; that exercise and positive role models have helped in the past; what would people here recommend?

"How the hell are you even supposed to recover when you're struggling with binge eating, b/p AND restricting? TW: Talking about abusive parents that fueled my eating disorder; a lot of ED thought patterns

I was a chubby kid until I wasn't. My parents are honestly fucking terrible and love to talk about weight and food and how fat of a child (y'all, I was 9, calm down) I was and how I should stop eating so much, etc etc. I never learned healthy portion sizes, because in our house it was either excess or legit one meal a day. So no wonder that when I was like 14, I started restricting. I started getting really into their weird diet and I lost weight pretty fast. My parents were happy about that.

So, a few years later, the heavy impact the malnutrition had on my body started becoming obvious. I was anaemic af, I constantly fainted, I looked like I was dead... My doctor started to get worried. But since my family is a mess, nobody ever considered sending me to therapy. Instead I was encouraged to eat highly caloric food which made me miserable and eventually depression led me to overeating and I gained a LOT of weight. After trying to get back to restricting and failing miserably, that then evolved into B/P.

So, essentially I'm just a mess that can't eat food without making it a disaster. I have gone through the same cycle over and over again. My boyfriend discovered I was purging and got upset, so I started to just restrict after binges, which then just lead me back to restricting and losing weight. The weight loss eventually makes people worried so I start eating again to make them stop being so damn concerned, which then spirals out of control into binge eating. Once I gained a bunch of weight back, I panic and start purging again and the cycle begins anew.

Thing is, I am so goddamn sick of this who thing. I just want to be okay. Food takes up so many of my thoughts and it's tiring. I am either counting calories or planning my next binge or obsessing over my next purging opportunity or *whatever* really and it legitimately prevents me from just living my life. And I mean, it obviously makes me miserable. The only issue is that I can't just do the ""regular"" kind of treatment for binge eating, because that only triggers my brain into restricting. Which on paper will look good at first (people always make a point to congratulate on me ""getting healthy"" when I start restricting again when I'm still at a high weight due to bingeing; haha, very funny y'all), but then later it'll just completely spiral out of control. I can't do ""intuitive eating"" because I have no intuition and I'm never hungry. I only want food because my binge eating brain and I also really don't want food because of restricting brain.

I know y'all can't treat me, but maybe someone's been in a similar situation as I have been. It doesn't help that part of my brain doesn't want to get into recovery until I'm underweight again because anorexia is obviously the ""better"" diagnosis, but like... I assume anorexia recovery would just trigger me back into bingeing or purging... Can I just get a brain transplant or something?",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"Dating as a schizophrenic Hey all, ladies and gentlemen. 

I haven’t posted here in a while but I figured I could come here of all places. 

I’ve found that dating has been hard, I’ve put myself out there the past few years. I approached women and met a lady through my cousin but I got stood up. Now, I can accept that it’s very possible my game lacked, but for the most part, ever since I was diagnosed and hospitalized twice: dating has been non existent for me. 

After much thought, I’ve found the stigma surrounding schizos is a great pain to deal with. Often times people have these assumptions made about me and it limits the possibility to actually get to know me. And to make things worse, I tried tinder but let’s be honest I don’t care much personally for those women as at this point in my life I need a real relationship. 

Maybe I was too narrow minded but I wanna ask anyone here for some pointers on how to go about dating, perhaps where you may have met your partner and whatnot. I’m open to any ideas, at this point it seems I might just look for a female who’s also been diagnosed with this condition.

It’s definteky made me ‘grow up’ in a sense from this experience. And I’ll never do something like that EVER again. Would I be able read a book once every two weeks on a sat perhaps and have a glass or two of red? Or has that bender fucked up my sleeping pattern for good?

"Calming an autistic family member down after a mass shooting (New Zealand)? I  have a high-functioning autistic brother that lives with my parents. He  has this problem where, after an active shooter incident gets widely  reported, he gets very **tense and agitated.**

He obsesses over the shooter's identity and looks up every minutiae of their life on [Heavy.com](https://heavy.com/) and Daily Mail. I feel like he takes it very personally when the news inevitably report that the shooter was **quiet, a loner, weird, and sometimes even has a confirmed autism diagnosis**.  He starts wailing and ranting about how he's just like the shooter,  that he has the dark thoughts too and that autism means it's his fate  that he'll go on a mass rampage as well.

If I'm not there in the house, he'll blow up my phone with calls talking about his **fantasies of who he's going to kill**  and where he's going to strike, to get back at all the bullies in his  life, and that he'll do it if I don't come back and be there for him. He  never has any sympathy for the victims, especially if it's a school  shooting - school was not a good time for him, he was tormented and made  fun of pitilessly by his peers. If the shooter got less than 25 kills  he'll mutter ""too bad he didn't get enough for a tactical nuke"" and, if  its something like this week's Christchurch, New Zealand shooting, he  celebrates their ""top score.""

We  haven't reported this to anyone outside our family. I think he just  feels as shocked and worried about the media reporting, and just wants  to be comforted. But, being unable to express himself adequately through  his Asperger's, the only way he can get us to meet his needs is through  attention-seeking behavior.

This time his reaction is very bad though. **The shooting this time happened right where we live, New Zealand**,  and it's all people are talking about. My parents called me back home  for the weekend because of how he is his reacting. He was fantasizing  again - saying that the best time to do a follow-up strike is at a  vigil, then people will really know they can never be safe. We have  locked him in his room, for his own safety, and as a precaution. **I can hear him right now yowling and banging against his dresser.**

**We  have him already going through CBT therapy, and doctors have him on  antidepressants and other medication. So I don't know what else can we  do?** The regular psychologist sessions we have set up for him  are very expensive, and I have to split part of my paycheck to help my  parents pay for them. But so far, counseling seems like total quackery:  it doesn't seem to have helped him at all.

Usually  after a week my brother calms down. He tearfully apologizes for his  outbursts, and tells us that he's just so jealous of the victims, or the  shooter who gets to suicide by cop. Every day living with autism and  knowing that he will never be normal and that no-one will ever love him  is pure pain, and he just wants to die so much. One of the e-mails he  sent to me in the past:

&gt;You  can gain victory only if you choose death for yourself because the  bullies actually make up our entire world. Because the second you choose  death, the world disappears into nothingness, the harassers, too, disappear into nothingness. Then, peace will come to you.

"What does it take for someone to be considered an alcoholic? My mother drinks more than she should at get togethers. She doesn’t think she has a problem and that I’m ruining her fun or that I’m ridiculous. She is very light and can’t have over two servings of wine before she starts getting in that drinking haze. 

She doesn’t drink in the morning but sometimes will start at 5ish if she’s home early enough and she will have more than a serving size in each glass she pours. 

I talk to a therapist and she says that my mom is an alcoholic and that I keep making excuses for her drinking and I didn’t want to think of her that way but I kinda have learned to accept it. 

Also my younger sister doesn’t see this side of her and when I mention some of it to her she acts like I’m overthinking it. (She doesn’t live with us she got married and moved out a few years ago) I don’t tell my sister directly that oh moms an alcoholic or anything I say that she’s had too much or she is having too much. 

There was only one time that my sister saw anything of it at a party at her place where my mom really had too much and wouldn’t let me take her drink away (I tried my best not to draw attention to me doing that) and she really needed to get out of there to not embarrass herself and my sister tried to take the drink away from her but my mom clutched onto it for dear life. I did eventually get her out and she had to vomit half the way home.

Since I live with my mom I’ve seen more of her drinking problems as my sister has not.

 I think my mom uses wine as a crutch.  She had a toxic relationship with my father and that’s where I was making excuses for her and was wondering why she doesn’t think to drink responsibly! I don’t drink hardly at all because of her. The only alcoholic drink I maybe will try is a cooler maybe twice a year but that’s it.

She did admit to me one time that she had a drinking problem. It was after a night with friends at our place where she was NOT making sense and it embarrassed me and I was mad the next day. That was the first tome she ever said something because before she always denied it. 

I said to my therapist but it comes and goes like there will be bad weeks, a good week, a bad weekend. Sometimes a month where I don’t see her overdrinking. But she says that’s how alcoholics are and that they still can be considered a alcoholic even if they don’t drink everyday or in morning hours.

You see I would know that she drank too much BUT I did not have it in my head that she is an alcoholic because I didn’t want to have that fact added onto my life as another issue. I had alcoholic and my mom drinks too much separated if that makes sense. 

Sometimes we go out with friends to a restaurant and she gets wine there with another bit you know they give you a small container of more wine to refill your glass) then she comes home and pours herself another large glass. 

Sorry this was so long this is my first time posting in this subject.  

I don’t tell my mom that she’s having too much anymore because my therapist gave me things to do. Like go downstairs when she starts drinking and don’t acknowledge it. Because when I mention it she says I’m crazy and as long as I talk to her about it she has a reason to put blame on me that I overthink everything hence “she doesn’t have a drinking problem” I do better now around her drinking and try not to let it upset me. I used to tell her when she stopped making sense “you aren’t making sense you’ve had too much to drink” but now I just notice it and go down to my room downstairs.

It would upset me because we don’t live with my father anymore so she shouldn’t have a reason to drink too much anymore...but she needs to help herself get better... does anyone think this is enough to be considered one? I gave way more I could say but  I’m gonna stop here..sorry it’s so long.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Are these flashbacks and how do I help? (TW) My partner has severe PTSD and is diagnosed with DID as well (for those familiar with it, he is the host of a system of 15+ and still occasionally growing). I’ve seen him have intense episodes where he will be unresponsive and shake, cry, mutter, and fail to recognize who I am. A handful of times now I have watched him go very quiet and still, and become totally unresponsive to his environment. If I pat his hand, say his name, try to look him in the eyes, I get nothing. It usually lasts a few minutes from what I can tell.  Every time except for the most recent one, when he’s come back he has not remembered what was happening and wasn’t aware he spaced out. 

This time, however, when he became responsive again it was similar to when he wakes up from nightmares, but worse. He went from still and unresponsive to shaking aggressively and being unable to speak or respond in any way but shaking his head “no.” 

At first I asked “what happened?” and “are you okay?” and “do you want to talk about it?” but I know that asking questions often overwhelms and does not help. A few minutes went by and I said “it’s okay, I won’t ask any more questions. We don’t have to talk about it.” and finally he nodded. I held him and he eventually calmed down. 

How do I help him, not just in the moment, but if he opens up later about the flashbacks/recovered memories/whatever else is going on? Has someone done something for you that really helped? And what do you recommend for helping support him in the long run?

"How do you cope with not knowing what's real anymore? It is just now dawning on me that I am schizophrenic and probably have been for a long time. Looking back I used to believe that my professors were deliberately putting confusing instructions on tests to hurt me. I kept thinking that co workers had it out for me and even when random people would smile at me that they had ulterior motives. I went through three semesters in college where I failed out and did not know why but understood a lot of it had to do with my mental health. I cut all of my friends and family off from where I was from. It started slow and a lot of it was unearthed from partying too much. It started as anxiety and became depression. I stopped being able to develop feelings. I stopped caring about life for a very long time. I was able to hide it at first because I thought a lot of it was normal. Partying helped a lot with that because it served as a distraction. I had a prescription for adderall that I used extremely loosely. At first it was because I did not want to develop a tolerance but later it was only to distract myself. Eventually it became a tool to self medicate although looking back it helped with my ADHD but did not do me any good in the long run. Adderall would help me function and weed would help me calm down. Alcohol would help me feel anything. I kept the delusions especially to myself because I didn't want to admit something could be wrong. This happening to me has always been my biggest fear. At first it started with feeling as if I was being watched and judged. The most common one was that people were talking about me. I became disassociated with time. I couldn't keep track of the day of the week any longer. I stopped being able to recognize people. Remember names or faces. Register what faces meant what emotions. My sense of smell went away for a while. I did not care what I ate or wore. Everything around me had meaning but nothing meant anything to me. Music was especially interesting to me. It did not matter what kind of music it was it all had some kind of meaning associated with it. There were messages even if they did not have anything to do with me. I was worried people could read the thoughts that were in my head. I stopped trusting everyone and became defensively aggressive. It was like I was scrambling to grab onto some sense of reality and every time someone talked to me they were attacking me and trying to pull me away. I felt like one incident that started the process was my first hallucination. It was during the school year when I was stressed and on the phone. I had recently just stopped being homeless where I had been sleeping in my car and studying in the library. I saw a person across my room that was me. It was all of my negative feelings embodied as a person. It scared me and I tried to put it behind me. I was hoping that it was a one time thing. Looking back I had other hallucinations but I didn't acknowledge them. I lived like that for a very long time, but I didn't want to admit that I could be crazy. It wasn't until the day before Halloween that I completely broke. Before that I just limited my routine and was just extremely defensive. I couldn't venture too far from my apartment without having panic attacks. Slowly my life became smaller. I couldn't hold my job any longer. I trusted the people around me, but looking back they enabled me in a lot of ways. For a lot of that time I feel fog. I can't recall a lot. The reality started settling in I was able to stop drinking. It wasn't even hard. I almost feel as if I am a different person now and I am having a hard time differentiating between what was real and what wasn't. I know I have to talk to someone. I am just slowly coming to terms with the fact that this is my life now. I know it can't do it on my own and my girlfriend can't be the only person I rely on.

"Advice needed on child with Autism and puberty My 10 year old son has high-functioning Autism.

"Switching from Wellbutrin to adderall What can I expect here? I was on Ritalin as a kid 7-13ish but haven't been on stims since then. Ive  been on Wellbutrin for....2 years?

"Anyone here managed to heal their trauma permanently?  

Hello

Im gonna keep this as brief as possible.

41 year old male been suffering with following symptoms since early childhood: Insomnia, anxiety, depression, clumsyness, poor memory, poor balance, poor self esteem, poor personal boundaries, lethargy, poor motivation, shyness, social isolation, learning difficulties, poor concentration, lack of purpose, short temper, restless legs, zoning out and probably dozens other shitty things I forget.

I had my brain scanned and blood tested, they found nothing. I eat healthy and go to the gym regurarely. I been studying about trauma for the last yeatrs, and ss far as I can tell all these problems stem from suppressed childhood events, or stuff happening before I was born.

I tried talking with shrinks but I dont feel it helps, I assume the healing must take place at a much deeper level than merely talking.

I studied and tested many techniques. I can now tune into my mind\\body and sense the trauma if that makes any sense. I let go and then the urge to scream, shake, cry, etc comes at will. When have the tried to release with following therapy techniques: EMDR, EFT, TAT, Mindfulness, Talking to my inner wounded child, TRE (Trauma Release Excercises), breathing techniques, yoga, visualisations and offcourse just letting myselg cry, scream punch, shake, etc.

I literally spent hundreds of hours trying this, and it gives me momentarely relief. I usually feel very relaxed afterwards, sometimes even blissful.

However the relief only last for some hours and the next day I'm usually back to my neurotic self again. I feel like my whole life is slipping my by while I'm trying to fix my broken self.

Thus I'd like to hear any suggestions to heal early imprinted trauma, if suck even exists.",ptsd,ptsd

Fully accept and embrace that you have ADHD (I had trouble with this and denied for many years the fact I wasn't ""normal"").

2. Realize that having ADHD is not your fault.  You had no control over the way you were born.

3. Read all of the articles on ADDitudemag.com.  I find this site incredibly useful, easy-to-read, and with high-quality information (editors with PhDs).  There is so much to learn.  The knowledge you will gain from this site will soothe you and give you the tools to live your best life.

I struggle with mental health issues and was helped along the way by people when I didn’t want to but nothing I am doing is helping my bf. 

He’s almost 40 and has a strong background in drug use (E, meth, LSD, has a drinking issue, smokes pot 2-3 times a day) and has auditory hallucinations even while not high and some visual that he says are acid flashbacks. 

He thinks people, usually coworkers, are always talking about him in a negative way. No matter what job he has had in the past 20 years it’s the coworkers. He thinks random people in the mall, coffee shop, etc will say stuff about him to others. He has acted in retaliation to hallucinations and gone to talk to his bosses or will say things to random strangers. I was his boss at one point which made for some interesting conversations. 

He’s been dealing with that for as long as I have known him (4 years) and he seems to cycle out of it for a while and then come back after a couple weeks/months. 

Sometimes the FBI is coming for him (even though we are Canadian) CIA, border patrol, RCMP etc. That paranoia is especially bad when he’s not smoked pot for about 24 hours. 

The past year however and specifically the past month has been different. I was always a safe person for him and someone who was not in his mind talking about him or out to get him. He’s said a couple things lately about being paranoid about me doing something or saying things. He’s also with in the week been seeing things. Tonight he swore people were chasing him while he was driving in a parkade and chanting things at him. There was no one there. 


He also suffers from depression and anxiety and when I say he did a lot of drugs it was about 10 years of heavy daily drug use. He’s just started doing E and LSD again with a new buddy since the summer after years of not and drinks almost daily.

Recently I noticed a decline in my motivation and attention. I don't feel as motivated, or sociable. I want to stay in bed all day and be unproductive whereas before it would annoy me if I didn't do anything productive for at least an hour. I feel lazier, and when I do school work I get about an hour in when I just want to stop and do something else. 
I was wondering if this was due to not taking it on weekends, or if I'm just building a tolerance to it. If I took it every day, would this just worsen the lack of motivation, or improve it? 
I know this type of medication is different, but as an example, if you don't take birth control every day it loses its effectiveness, that doesn't apply to stimulants does it?

"The term Autistics Hello everyone. 
I have 2 kids on the spectrum. One with Asperger's, the other Autistic. 
I just wanted to question the term 'Autistics'.
It seems to be that its a term used to describe people with autism but I find that so bizarre. I refer to my children as 'having' autism. Because their autism makes them amazing but they are so much more than that. They are children with autism.
I have a friend whose child has down syndrome. She hates her being called 'Downs' and insists that people refer to her as having down syndrome instead, because downs syndrome doesn't define her. 
I wondered if you lovely lot could explain to me the reasoning behind the term Autistics so I can understand why it is so widely used on Reddit.

"To the bank teller I encountered yesterday Fuck you.  

I was feeling good because I am finally the same size as my small mother (who has always been small, while me not so much) and said mother has been passing down some of her clothes that she doesn’t wear much anymore.  This dress fit me perfectly and in my head I looked so good.

Then you had to say this when I came into the bank:

“Oh you look so cute, what a good time of year to be pregnant and wear cute little dresses.”

Wat? Did I hear you right, maybe not...

But then.  Your dumb ass doubled down.

“You’re probably exhausted though and disagree.  Being pregnant is hard work.”

I glared.  Your co-worker looked uncomfortable.  Your peppy face probably thought I was being rude.  I could have killed you right then.  I should have let you squirm and then set you straight.  I was embarrassed and didn’t say shit.

Bitch, I’ve lost 50 lbs in the past year and kept it off.  I’m a normal weight finally down from obese.  I’m working on the last ten or fifteen than WON’T BUDGE and my fucking gut won’t go away and it’s making me sick in the head.

I’m under 130 lbs.  I may have been constipated (it happens when you don’t eat much) and maybe that dress wasn’t as flattering as I thought.  (I guess there’s a reason mother got rid of it), but you sure didn’t say that to the 300 lb woman behind me, did you?  You wouldn’t have dared.

You not only ruined my day but you ruined the lunch I was going to eat with my husband right after.  There was lots of “what’s the matter babe”?. Oh but I couldn’t tell him because I was embarrassed and he’d lie to me saying you were an idiot and I’m not fat when clearly I am still very much fat.  He means well but doesn’t know what it’s like.

So it was starving myself and then a massive binge because what’s the point if I look pregnant?  Also, I’m giving the dress to charity, though I should burn it so some unsuspecting girl doesn’t fall victim.

"My SO has a drinking problem, he knows but he doesn’t want to work on it My boyfriend (27M) of 8 years has been struggling with drinking for the past several years. 

About 4 years ago, I started to notice his drinking getting worse. The point where it got to a breaking point was about 3 years ago, he wasn’t working, he definitely got depressed and began drinking more. He ended up getting a DUI and I thought maybe that would be a wake up call. Unfortunately, it did nothing. I tried to talk to him about his drinking and he constantly shrugged it off saying he didn’t have a problem. 

Fast forward to last year, he got drunk on July 4th at my parents, fought with my dad, embarrassed me in front of my friends and family, came home and left the back door open so my cat got out and stripped nude to pass out on the couch. We argued the next day about how he needs to stop, he admitted he has a problem and said he needed to work on it. For a month or so, he did. But then one night had beers with his dad, came home and passed out on the couch. 

It’s been over a year, and I feel like every other month it’s the same conversation... you need to work on this, not just for you but for us. Agreeing, working on it for 1 week, 1 month, then going right back to it again.

And is it normal to suddenly have dozens of uncontrollable tics? (swallowing weird, moving my shoulders, twitching my mouth to the side, etc.)

"PTSD without the (visual) flashbacks The incident that caused this situation happened 5 years ago, and I somehow just never dealt with it. I moved on with my life, I would tell the story to people but in a disconnected way and would just never ever think about it.  I recently started therapy and my therapist, like my friends, is pretty sure I've got PTSD. 

For the longest time I didn't think I did because I don't experience a lot of the symptoms others have. But since starting therapy and acknowledging it has had an effect it's like the symptoms are starting. I had my first nightmare in 5 years about the incident. I've been triggered by fireworks several times now (I get 'emotional flashbacks' or whatever it's called) and I do finally notice that I'm hypervigilant when I'm out in public and there's people walking behind me. 

I also just notice there's a very clear 'before' and 'after' in regards to my personality and the things I'm (not) interested in. I also avoid any media/stories/situations that remind me of what happened. 

I'm a bit worried it's gonna get worse before it gets better? The being triggered by fireworks thing is really pissing me off. Like, for 5 years I was fine (well, I could just quickly distract myself before any emotions happened anyway) and now I'm not anymore. 

How long after the situation did it start for you? And is are there many people who don't have visual flashbacks? My therapist kept asking me questions about if I would see something when I heard the fireworks, and I really don't. It just brings on a feeling of fear/panic. ",ptsd,ptsd

This is an illness I've been suffering from for 15 years and people telling me it makes me special and it's a gift and to get off my meds... it really triggers me. It ruins my day. It makes me depressed. It hurts so bad. And I don't deserve this additional suffering. I want to help and be supportive but it can't be at the cost of my own mental health. I want to be functional again. I want to be able to finish my degree. I want to be able to work again. And this was once a nice support system for me but it doesn't feel that way anymore. I'm sorry. I wish everyone the best of luck on their journeys. But this is my journey and I don't need this negative feedback eating away at me. Thank you for listening.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

How do you experience your “ED Voice”? I’ve heard a lot of people with eating disorders talk about their ED/Ana/Mia voice.  It always confused me that everyone was calling it a voice (it makes it sound like psychosis or something).

For me it’s just my own internal dialogue which explains why I was so confused.  Now I need to know if I’m the odd one out- how do you guys experience this?,EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"Lately driven to anxious and obessive thoughts when on medication So I have been taking Medikinet for about 2 years now, feeling pretty released after such a long time of being unable to bring anything whatsoever to a statisfying end. Starting out with a dose of 60 mg a day (20-20-20-0) everything went its way, all sunshine and hapiness, me doing what I was incapable to do before.

**TL;DR: I take Medikinet**

Now last year I had an injury, got surgery and the injured joint got immobilized for 2 months, with 6-12 months out from sports.
During this time, mostly since I had nothing to do and studied something in that direction, I read up a lot on medical topics regarding my injury and propably got a bit obsessed or very obsessed about it, to the point where I didnt sleep anymore to guarentee ""the optimal outcome"" of the injury, which I only could by doing certain things, while sleeping would only ruin the results (sounds manic? yeah about right).

**TL;DR: I showed hypomanic and compulsive behavior for some time, propably because of the meds. I think those episodes are actually easy to prevent, by simply doing sports, which I couldn't in the time it happened**

I think medication had a lot to do with it, since it allowed me to get so very focussed on that topic and also, maybe as a downside of highened selfcontrol, made me experience my anxious fantasies physically and interpret anythingthing as some dangerous sign, rather than just some minor after effect of the injury that can to be expected. 
So as you might imagine, once level headed again, this whole thing scared me a lot, I mean I basicly had some compulsive, manic episode, which might have been a result of the meds. So I lowered the dose afterwards and didn't really feel safe taking the medication in the doses I did before anymore. Additionally I feel myself getting more cramped and concerned with the remains of my innjury when I'm on my meds. Theres definitly an aftermath to that injury, the joint isnt fully mobile yet and there are muscular inbalances, resulting in some tension, but on meds I often experience them as more handicapping than they really are, mostly because I can stay focussed on those concerns when on meds, while without them I'd just get distracted after 10 seconds. So when taking meds I often find myself getting obsessed with ""fixing the problem"" again, which is a thing that didnt happen before the injury. Before the injury I'd just focus on the task at hand.

**TL;DR: While on meds I can and do remain focussed on anxious thoughts, resulting in experiencing them far stronger, while without meds Im just hopping from one thought to the next.**

Well thing is, the medication was actually working, it has been removing a lot of the struggles I have had prior to taking it, yet now I feel uncomfortable taking higher doses and to be honest the dose I am taking at the moment isnt really doing its job (around 10 mg a day). So in the end I want to have the ""almost-ADHD-free"" time back I had when first taking the meds, but am concernced with taking higher doses. Suggestions?

**Is anyone else experiencing problems with physical discomfort while on meds or anxious thoughts taking over?** 

**Anyone else having experiences with hypomanic episodes when on meds?**

**How do you go about such problems?**

So since the first advice will be ""go talk to a doctor"": Yeah I will, I recently moved to a new city and need to get my shit together and find a new doc here (one that does more than just filling out prescriptions  and marketing magical vodoo spirit training (I don't even know how a medical professional can be into this ""alternative medicine"" stuff while still prescribing psychopharmaka, i guess theres a reason he is the only one I could get an appointment with)).

Also this isnt my native language, so be gentle on grammar mistakes and stuff, they will be everywhere (or as you propably finished reading: They have been everywhere, I know).

"inability/anxiety over sleep? I’ve been real bad recently, for over two weeks I’ve been stuck in a depressive mood. all excitement for life is gone and I’m really struggling to take care of myself, let alone those dependant on me (like my pets). of course my sleeping has turned miserable too. 

I’ve never been able to sleep easily. I’ve always struggled throughout work and school to maintain a healthy sleeping schedule. half the time I’d be running on 5 hours of sleep because I just can’t fall asleep. 

after my ptsd being diagnosed having spoken about the abuse that’s happened, it’s gotten worse. 

now it’s less of a difficulty, it’s more of an anxiety. 

I feel anxious over sleeping. I think about sleeping and I start to panic. my chest is tight, and I start to want to cry. I try to lay there to sleep but I’m on the verge of a panic attack. I just physically can’t do it. 

it’s always bad when I’m stuck in a depressive rut for weeks. which I’m currently in. 

I can be so damn exhausted but I can’t sleep because I’m almost fearful of it??

I’ve tried, what feels like, everything. no screens an hour before bed time, sleeping pills, melatonin, lavender sleeping spray, mindfulness, rain sounds, yoga, a bath with supposedly relaxing bubble bath in it. I exercise for half an hour, I go outside for a walk, I take vitamins. I mean even my current antidepressant makes me drowsy but it’s not enough to allow me to sleep because of this weird fear. nothing helps. 

I don’t know what to do. I only just fixed my sleep from years of waking up at 4pm. finally I slept within normal hours and now it feels ruined. 

it’s 2am as of writing this because I’ve given up lying in bed for an hour on and off crying out of fear. 

every doctor either treats me like a dumbass, a brat, or just tells me “no screens and take sleeping pills” *which isn’t helping me at all.* my entire family and s/o treat me like a bratty child with this (or that’s really how it feels). them mentioning or telling me to go to sleep causes such anxiety that I shut off. I try to explain I’m not being stubborn but sleep makes me anxious, and my family definitely rolls their eyes. 

I really want to sleep and I get upset that I can’t. I don’t want to be this way. I can tell you right now I’m physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted but I can’t sleep. I have a massive headache from sleep deprivation and my body hurts. 

if I do sleep I’ve basically passed out from exhaustion as my body can’t physically keep me awake any longer. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m sick of it. 

does anybody have any suggestions? I’m willing to try anything at this point, I’m so desperate.",ptsd,ptsd

"First appointment coming up soon! + Accommodations at school TL:DR; I have strong reason to believe I have ADHD and I'm about to go to the therapist in two weeks to prove it. What should I expect from the appointment and from my university re: accommodations? 

I'm a non-traditional student currently powering through my undergraduate program (2 years down, 2 years to go.) My GPA is not great but not so bad that I've been kicked out of school. I couldn't put my finger on why I was struggling so much until one of my kid sisters got diagnosed with combination ADHD and  I started doing research on it. I realized that I have many of the same symptoms she does! 

The conversation I had with my family/long-time friends was like this.

me:Hey, I'm really struggling in school, and just in being an adult in general, especially when it comes to deadlines. Do you think I could have ADHD?

literally all of them: I'm not a professional, but dear God, probably. It would explain so, so much about you. Go get checked out.

So I took a self-assessment and out of the 18 questions, I scored ""often"" or ""always"" on 16 of them. That probability was sky-high in my eyes, so my appointment is on 10 March. I had a hideous test score (passed, but just) in my Math class a couple of weeks ago. I let my professors know what my suspicions were and they said to me,""If you get the paperwork, we can make accommodations for you.""

I guess my question is, what should I expect during that first appointment? What kind of paperwork should I ask from my new therapist?

"ADHD made me a nasty, rude person for the first 20 years of life... I never would've thought I had ADHD. I simply thought I was spoiled, bratty, arrogant, unmotivated, or basically any other thing you can think of. The symptoms were all there but I just never knew until I hit my breaking point- junior year of college, barely skimming over notes an hour before a test in a class I had a 30% average in.

I feel like I will never get back the first 20 years of my life. Being impulsive, wreckless, saying nasty things to someone's face and flipping out on my friends was so common that I thought it was normal. I've yelled at countless strangers, even little kids, and drove like an absolute jerk in traffic, flashing my high beams at slow drivers, tailgating, and changing 3 lanes at a time. My GPA has irreversible damage and I already have a terrible credit score... and I'm in college with NO job. 
Late to everything, forgetful, and never had a relationship that lasted longer than two months. Everyone around me basically has to accommodate for me being late and forgetful. I know I'm pretty by society's standards but I either scare guys away or just completely push them away so easily. 

It just feels unfortunate but that's life...

I just wish I knew I had ADHD earlier.. I feel like I would've had a better high school GPA, gotten into a better college, and made something more of myself. It just sucks how easily ADHD symptoms can be mistaken for a mere lack of motivation or just a minor personality glitch.

My aunt doesn't agree and pressures him to come greet me ""formally"" even tho he doesn't like it, to ""educate him"" and ""teach him how to be polite"". I cringe a bit at her ordering him to come greet me, and I try to keep it to a fist bump which seems to be more comfortable for him.

It's not my kid but I wanna be supportive to him as much as possible and I don't know what to do, should I tell his mother to drop the idea and tell her to not force him to do that or should I let her teach him ""politeness"" and not interfere ?

When off the meds I often feel like I am a data base. When I’m not on my meds and someone talks to me I honestly feel like a database. They ask me a question and it feels like I can almost feel my brain searching for it or i can feel the gears literally grinding. This is something I only get off the meds and honestly it feels great because my mind is racing so fast it’s almost like papers are being fluttered and files are being traced.

"I don't suffer from PTSD, but I believe I've blocked out all my memory. Can someone with more experience help? First, I should say I don't have PTSD. I don't even suspect I do. I'm being treated for schizophrenia. My mom has PTSD and she's been through a lot of messed up stuff, but I've experienced no significant trauma that I know of. The closest thing I've had was my parents going through a pretty nasty divorce and a seriously strained relationship with my brother. That said, I do have some serious mental issues I have trouble making sense of, and now it's going into a realm that some of you might understand. I'm really looking for answers, so please read everything and try to help me out if you have a minute.  


I had a pretty major episode in which I cut my tongue off with a miniature guillotine. It was reattached at a hospital. Recently I've had a lot of temptation to do it again, but I think I've resolved that today.  


That said, schizophrenia doesn't seem to sum up my problems. I don't have a lot of psychotic symptoms. Just some delusions occasionally. I looked up depersonalization/derealization disorder, and that sounded like a page out of my biography. I realized that I really like who I am, but I don't ever *feel* like who I am. So I thought I'd found my problem. And then I did some more research into it, and I found out that dpdr is a method of coping with trauma or anxiety. That part confused me. I'm not anxious, and I don't think I've had significant trauma.  


Recently I've been thinking a whole lot about cutting my tongue off again. I've been miserable, and for some reason it seems like it would fix me, though I'm not sure how. And then I had a long talk with my dad today. We talked about my entire life history, and I swear, it's like it was all new to me. I remembered these things he said as *facts*, not memories. And when I said I had no trauma, he mentioned everything from nearly drowning to kawasaki's disease to cutting my tongue off. I know a lot of you have been through much worse, but these things must be causing me to block my memory.  


So I've come to realize that memory is the key. My former counselor told me once that people think of things, especially there own lives, through stories, but I don't feel like I have a story. And without a story, I don't have an identity. I want to remember everything: the good, the bad, the funny and the tragic, but I just can't. I really like who I am. I'm smart and funny and tall and skinny, but these things don't help me when I don't feel like it's me. I believe that if I can reconstruct my story and hold it in my head at all times like I used to, I'll be better able to address my problems. The problem is I've written off so many parts of my story that didn't seem ideal. When you read a book, every piece of lore you come across is a golden truth that you hold onto, but as you go about writing your own story, you're tempted to just write things off. Things that ""don't count."" I realize now that none of my life has counted, and now I'm 18 years old and don't feel like anybody. My memories don't haunt me like they haunt some of you, but I just don't think about them. I want to though. I really want them back. Are there any medications that will help make things clearer that I could talk with my psychiatrist about? What about ways to remember my story? I believe my problem is kind of opposite of most of yours. You guys have things you don't want to remember, but I want to remember everything.",ptsd,ptsd
"Hearing music that isn't real About 1 week ago when I was home alone I decided to play my old piano. I'm not very good so I was just playing a few chords. When I was done I closed the piano and walked out to sit in the living room. When I was sitting down I began to hear the most beautiful piano music being played. It was very loud but it did not sound like it was coming from my own piano. I quickly got up and walked over to my piano and I continued to hear the music. It sounded like it was very far off or like in another dimension but it was also loud.

"Having a small meltdown over jeans I have a lot of body issues, one of them is the only thing I feel comfortable wearing at work are skinny jeans. I have to wear pants, I don't like loose fitting pants. I hate jeans, but I have tolerated skinny jeans because they compress the loose skin and I get used to them after they're on, I forget about them. They even help with my poor circulation a little.

Until now that is. Now, I go to buy a new pair and discover Old Navy has changed the fabric content of their jeans. Used to be 88% cotton, 8% elasterell, 3% spandex.

I lost a lot of weight and I have a lot of loose skin, that elasterell was actually a necessity. Now the content is 72% cotton, 26% poly-FUCKING-ester, 2% elastane

I hate it. There is no adjusting to it, I tried. It feels awful, it fits awful, it doesn't breathe and I am constantly aware of it, how much of my fucking day is spent think about my fucking PANTS

I can't find the old jeans anywhere online. The only remaining pairs (only 4 left!) with the same fabric content is ONLY available in size 0. They are clearly running out the stock on it and moving forward with their new plastic pieces of shit excuses for 'jeans'

"Difference Between Normal Behaviours and ADHD I went to get a test for autism, and got a referral from an expert to get tested for ADHD instead. I've thought about this a lot, and wondered what really separates normal behaviours from those exemplified by ADHD?

Some examples:

- I can stare into space for quite a long time, or until I get bored
- Everyday menial tasks are very stressful, especially hygiene (I haven't showered in sometimes a week or more!)
- I have important deadlines for university in a few days time, but right now I'm an expert in Indian tech support scams

"Job Problems Hey everyone,

Looking to vent and maybe some advice.

Im dealing with cognitive impairments from either the illness or the medication. Not very severe, but enough that I notice it in certain areas and am worried about it. My memory is bad and my mind is often blank. For instance, in conversations I have little to say and just generally slow thinking with bad memory. The problem is my current job is very sort of cognitive heavy/intellectual. I got a job in a Central Bank where I'm part of a team to supervise and regulate financial firms. This means as a team, we meet with and discuss with financial firms on the performance etc and the financial risks to their firm. My role is pretty junior so far so I havent been directly doing the hard stuff yet but I can see that my cognitive impairments will get in my way in the future. The work requires so so much study and knowledge which is hard for me to retain. And there's also a problem in meetings or in work conversations I struggle to keep up with the conversation and provide any input at all. Holding meetings with the firms is a key part of the job which Ill be expected to do in the future. I know theres a certain degree of being new and knowing less etc in the beginning but I notice this in normal conversations not just work related. I can see this getting in my way of progressing or even doing my job once the full responsibilities are given to me when Im not so new anymore.

This is affecting my self esteem and gives me a lot of anxiety in work. I hate being in meetings etc with nothing to say. I feel now that I should be doing a less sort of academic/cognitive heavy job and one maybe like a care assistant or a driver etc thats more hands on stuff. That would mean Id have wasted my time and money getting my degree and masters in business/finance though. Im considering  quiting the job but nearly everyone in my life will tell me not to I know because it is such a good job. 

The people are very nice in work and the job really is a great job, great holidays, good pay etc so it's very hard to give up and my performance reviews to date havent been bad . But I can see when Im expected to do the full role that Ill have difficulties.

Another option might be to disclose the illness or just the cognitive impairments and see what they say, maybe I can have a more tailored role. Or even if they knew about the illness I would  feel less anxious about contributing little in meetings etc. Its a public service job and they do claim to be inclusive of people with disabilities. I just didnt tell them in the when starting so I wonder if that would be a problem.

Im on the lowest dose of my abilify and have switched already from Risperdal and saw no discernable change so dont think a change in medicine could help.

But she has told me before that she things he like bangs on her door,  growls at her and like messes up her stuff.  The mother has told me that he never does this and I don't think it's true either.

"Have your symptoms gotten better or worse at certain points in life? I've been diagnosed with ADHD and take adderall 30 mg IR. It just doesn't seem to be working at all, even when I up the dose to 45 mg for a day. Initiating important things is still near impossible. Since getting professional help, it has forced me to think a lot about my past and the reasoning behind me being the way I am. I thought nothing was wrong with me but this is opening new doors.

I used to have a clean room and I was a neat freak. Hand washing, extremely organized and tidy room, and I even used gloves when playing with my toy cars and put them back where they came from.

Ever since high school, I sort of just became a mess. I can't even take things to the trash can and I kind of just leave them there. I exhibit all the trademark symptoms of ADHD like impulsivity, forgetfulness, bad short term memory, low self esteem, inability to focus for more than 5 seconds, wreckless driving, poor filter in social situations, hyperactivity, hyperfocus on all the wrong things, etc. It's just confusing me now because these are also signs of things like emotional abuse or neglect at a young age.  

This gap in between my childhood and high school to college is just confusing me. In terms of academics, I actually did very well in elementary school and middle school but that doesn't really say much since things were so easy back then. I was hyper and annoying but that died down in middle and high school which was when I was bullied daily.

My family dynamic changed as well. I've always been verbally abused to the extreme by my father who did not guide us but just gave us severe dehumanizing punishments for the most minor wrong doings. He had this deep, echoing voice that he would yell with and basically say I'm a product of his sperm and he can take me out at any time and I'm stupid because of my ""stupid"" mother when I was just 7 years old. This was over me leaving the exam room of an IQ test when I finished before my brother and it caused him to become nervous and cry. 

My mom opened up to me about my dad being severely emotionally abusive to her (which was obvious because it was so open and normal for the entire family) and even sexual abuse, like forcing her to have sex. It got so bad that her vagina became completely dry and she became void of all reality. My dad just told her to go see a doctor about her dry vagina problem. My mom went from kind, attentive and outgoing mother to a complete nervous wreck that was completely withdrawn from the family. The entire house just became a mess and my parents failed to recognize that we were all in a bad place. Me being dehumanized became so normal that I didn't think anything of it. As a coping mechanism, I feel like I started living in an alternate reality where my world didn't feel real anymore.

Being late to everything, not doing my best, and just being all foggy brained and a mess with emotional outburts became my new normal.

"family - advice appreciated Hey,

I’m a new mom and I have several nieces and nephews. I love them all so so dearly. One of my nephews is on the autism spectrum - he does speak, on occasion, and I engage with him so happily when he does decide to say something to me. I always greet him from a distance and am very respectful of his personal space, am quiet, try to make (but don’t force) eye contact, and never surprise him. I really love him to bits and want to build our relationship. 

Im having a hiccup in that he is not gentle with my baby (under 1 year old - squishing her cheeks, forcefully taking her toys from her hands, pulling her hair) and I think that his mother is too lenient with him. I am not versed in what appropriate discipline / conversation would be, so am just inclined to keep my child away. I ask him to keep hands away from the baby’s face but she allows it. It is really really important to me that the cousins become friends and the situation has me feeling like a bad mom/aunt. I wish I wasn’t so protective and scared of his size/behaviour. I don’t blame him or think he is trying to be malicious, and I do think he could be confusing the baby’s teethers with his own chewy sensory necklaces.

"Had high hopes but... Sorry this is long....

My boyfriend was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017. I wish I could say it was his first episode but as I think about it, I think it was his second one. This was a very traumatic episode, he hurt himself, the walls were filled with blood, he didn’t recognize me.

I didn’t know what to do, I called a friend and she recommended a psychiatrist, she was out of town but said she would be back in the afternoon and gave me instructions to take him to the hospital. That night the psychiatrist said it was either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

He started medication. Now I know his dose was too high and that those weren’t the right ones, but I trusted the psychiatrist. As time went one, his psychiatrist would point out he can’t keep doing weed and would refuse to treat him if he kept it out. He resented her for it and that definitely created some difficulties but most of all his belief that his diagnosis isn’t real.

I convinced him to see a new psychiatrist (almost 2 years later), she did change his medication and I felt things were in check. He has been working, being social and overall having a normal life. He still distrusted her because he was very vocal about not taking his medication and she lowered his dose instead.

Fast forward to this month, he said he wanted to stop his medication. He is still convinced he doesn’t have schizophrenia. The episodes he has had, he says, have been when he has had bad weed. He is irritable but he has learned coping skills for it not to be as bad as it used to be.

I have been reluctant about him stopping his medication. I do want to believe he is high functioning and maybe doesn’t need them, but I worry, sometimes I feel he just likes making life harder on himself.

All in all, he has been okay without his medication this month. Last night we had a great night on New Years. We were leaving his family’s get-together and he wanted to go out. I wasn’t feeling well so I stayed home. He said he would be a few hours. I woke up and he wasn’t there. 

I called and he seems okay but he has been having out with a new friend who I’ll just call C. C is very unstable, he has mentioned he has bipolar disorder. I’ve seen C high and low. He loves drinking and cocaine. I feel my boyfriend is off doing that, I just know he is.

We met C as a mutual friend of another and he was so depressed, I felt he was going to kill himself. So as normal human beings, my bf and I tried to help that night. Since then, my bf and C hang out weekly. My bf tells me it’s his first friend that gets him since he alienated himself from his old friends. And that he wants to help C, like I helped him out of his depression. He asked me to be more compassionate towards C but... I feel C is going to bring down my bf, adding new addictions and make him spiral.

I don’t know what I want from this post. Advice? Suggestions or maybe it’s just a need to vent.

I want to believe he wants to get better! Sometimes I want to believe he is right, this isn’t his diagnosis but the more I read about it. The more it fits with how he acts and responds.

I’m sorry if I’m posting in the wrong sub. I know this is for people with schizophrenia, but necessarily their significant others. 

I just wish I could somehow get him to see why my worries and concerns are real and genuine. It’s not about nagging. I love him so much, I just want him to be okay. To be healthy. To not self destruct and spiral back to his depression or another episode where he could hurt himself.

I worry he is going down a path that isn’t healthy for him and me. I have always told him he wouldn’t be alone, he would always have me now. But C’s influences, specially on cocaine use, truly scare me. I had a parent have a coke addiction and I don’t want to live through that again.  The line between caring for him and for me feels like it’s getting very thin.

"Wow. The Nightmares. Oh. My. Gosh. Forgot all about the PTSD nightmares. I'd fought them for years, and hadn't had them nearly as often lately -- or when I did, I  wasn't remembering them anymore, thank goodness. I recently got a secondary PTSD diagnosis related to medical surgeries/bone setting, and it has really kicked up my PTSD symptoms. Flinching from loud noises, contact, nightmares, anxiety, constant fear. 

With the new secondary  medical PTSD diagnosis -- the nightmares have come back, are violent, and are atrocious. Was up and down all night, and finally slept around 6AM.  And then I finally slept, and WOW. The nightmares. 

Was with a group of really shady people, and we were on some kind of late night mission. It all felt natural though, because I used to socialize with  some pretty shady people... -sighs- Don't ask. Just trying to get this out of my head so that I can shake reliving them in my head. Basically trekked with them to this unknown house, late at night, and everything went super south, super fast. 

The people I was with -- they murdered a woman that used to be my friend. I mean, I got held back, tied up, and told I needed to watch this. It was like being apart of the Manson/Tate murders, without being included. And I like... watched her, her husband, and her three children, get murdered by these shady people. I didn't... *do* anything. I *couldn't*... do anything. I felt the helplessness. The inability to do anything. I hate my brain. 

I think it was guilt. We had a  falling out a few years back over drug use. She got sick, and needed a heart transplant, and died less than a year after the transplant. She passed away a couple years ago, after a heart transplant failed to take.  She only had two kids. It felt so real. Like I hadn't seen her in so long, and in that time, she'd had another kid...

Three kids. Her  and her husband. Still hearing the damned screams. I don't remember it all -- but I definitely remember the screams. The blood. Stabbing. I started to realize it was a dream, and I was screaming. ""WAKE UP! WAKE  UP, IT'S NOT REAL. SHE DIED. I KNOW SHE DIED, WAKE UP."" I swore I was screaming in my sleep like I used to. I woke up abruptly, rolled out of bed, and just stared at the wall, breathing hard. It was bad. I forgot all about just how bad the night terrors are. They've been bad the past few weeks -- but this one... just... I can't shake it, and I'm still tearing up. Brutal.",ptsd,ptsd

"Developing Schizophrenia? Hi,

I’m in my late 20s and I have a brother diagnosed with Scz.

I have some “sympyoms” that makes me fear I have the condition too.

1. Delusions:

Since my teenage year I’ve been through several (potential) delusions.

I feared I was gay to a point I analyzed every move I make, how I sit, how I speak, how I walk, etc.

I feared I had cancer, I was terrified for a significant amount of time and caused me severe distress.

I feared I had leukemia.

I feared I had OCD.

And now I fear I have schizophrenia (since my brother diagnosis).

Now, every time there was a trigger of some sort that lead me live these delusional states. I never believed truly that I have any of these but the fear was present and causing me to seek reassurance constantly. Mostly involving losing hours and hours on internet, forums and med sites.

It looks like there is always something that has to cause me distress eventually, now is schizophrenia. Is like I’m trying to convince myself that I’m not constantly but in the same time accept the fact that it is what it is.

Now because my brain is constantly scanning my psyche for schizophrenia signs and gives me anxiety this is what I found:

I don’t have too much appetite (since 7-8 years ago) when these “fears” started interfering with my life.
I was always a little shy. I don’t like crowds, I don’t talk too much only if it is necessary.

Don’t talk too much with my family (childhood trauma, alcohol, scandals).

I fear that I hear voices, happened few times when I was very tired and half asleep, they weren’t truly voices as in hearing them in the proper sense, they were thought-like voices chatting random things between themselves. I reckon that’s my mind, I know that my thoughts are all mine (as in from my own mind) and never experienced real-world hallucinations.

I find myself telling things to my parrents, my brothers, my friends. I just tell them stuff and I imagine what would they replay to me.
I imagine telling them things I never said, should have said or want to say.
I imagine scenarios all the time, what I would do when certain things happen, picture myself as other people, powrful characters, etc.
These are all my own things, I imagine them in purpose.

However, I cannot go past the fear of becoming scz like my brother and the random chatter that occuree kind of annoyed me.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"I need help understanding trigger warning Hello, I am a 20 year old male and I'm not sure what is wrong with me. 

To start off the year 2018 was my senior year of course so all in all it was great, but after that it started going down hill. I have a family member that was a heavy drug user meth and all that jazz. He was a marine, and was suffering from schizophrenia also PTSD. Things started getting rough when he got back on the shit. Threating to kill my grandparents while I was present calling me the devil. I know it sounds crazy, but please bare with me. I would go up to my grandparents thinking ""Today's the day I'm going to find grandma with her brains blown out."" Luckily that never happened. I'm sorry for the description it's the only way I know to explain it. I'm skipping over a lot of things cause it was an everyday thing it seemed like. One of the memorable experiences was when I decided it was no longer safe for my gf to be present there due to the fact he was carrying a firearm and mumbling he was God and he decided who died and who didnt. Everything came to a head the day he used said firearm. Me my brother and his friends were all having a shooting day. My little brother and gf are in my mother's house. I decided to go in for a little bit and saw the  figure of said family member walk by with a hand gun in his hand. I also was armed. I remember walking out to where we were shooting and as soon as I walked up to him he let off three rounds into the brush I was standing a few feet away from him by then I felt the muzzle blast and the ringing in my ears  then he said ""Y'all like that."" I'm not entirely sure that's exactly how it happened, but it's as much as I remember.

 One I have never seen someone look at me like they were going to kill me 

Two I have never felt like I was going have to kill somebody before and I never want to feel it again. 

I know it's a lot different from actually killing someone, and I'm not really sure why it messes with me so much. 

No more shots were fired and no one was hurt and he just turned and walked away. We later found his gun after he was locked up it had a total 5 rounds left. Why would he come all the way to our house shoot three rounds and leave. My brother and I speculated he had ill intent, but we think he chickend out. We talked to one of the officers that locked him up and the officer told us if they didn't lock him up sooner or later he was going to kill somebody. He had shot up his own house threatened my grandparents killed his own dog etc. He was just crazy. All the stories I've heard about him in jail are nuts but that's a long story as well. 

After all that things settled down for a bit then my grandpa went into the hospital. I didn't think anything of it just went in for some minor pain so before I went on vacation I told him I loved him and gave him a hug goodbye. Four days into vacation I get a call he has stage four pancreatic cancer. 
That fucked me up worse than the experience before. So I asked my brother how long he says 6 months from what the doc said. I say fine the old timer can last 6 months I'll finish my vacation, also because grandpa said he would put a knot on my head if I came home. Then I get a call about 2 hours later he's got 30 days now. I was like Jesus fuck dude can this get any worse. Yep I get a call the next day ""You need to come home now."" Got on a plane that night. I arrive around 9:00 P.M. I get to my grandparents house he now has a week. I have no idea if it was my family trying not to freak me out or just sucky doctors. I sat down with him for a while I could tell he was dying. I tell my grandma goodnight and to call me if she needed anything. I get a call on 9/11 4:00 AM from my mother. He had died in his sleep. I go up to see my grandpa dead in his bed where he would want to be. I sat down with him for a bit. He was so so so cold. I can still feel it a year later now. The rest is just nasty and I don't want to go into detail. 

After the funeral things got better. Then 3 months after that I started having these symptoms. Anxiety, not trusting people can't sleep with out having a loaded gun, I can't sleep if nobody is home, I feel on edge out in public even more so gun violence is through the roof, I almost have a fear of seeing dead people now too. Its strange. 

I feel like I'm overreacting but I'm not sure or I wouldn't be posting here. I feel much better talking to people on Reddit vs my friends cause it seems like they think I'm crazy.  

I appreciate if I get any feedback

I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes wore me out typing all this. Also kind of southern rasing too. Not the best schools haha.

"Drug Induced Psychosis? mates in hospital need a semi-explination Hey guys not sure if anyone will see this but my mates and i are heaps stressed about one of our brothers 

&amp;#x200B;

So Saturday night we were all going to town for one of our other mates birthdays, we all normally delve into the drugs a bit mainly coke md xans anything we can get our hands on really. i was on coke and md that night and i think lets call him G was as well, we knew he had a problem with pharms also though but wasn't sure whether he was on any that night. 

the night went well i seen G go home and thought nothing of it. yesterday i got a call from a mate saying he was in hospital in an induced coma after taking anti psychotics he got from someone in town :(  


So apparently we arent 100% sure yet but believe he took a few of what could have been really strong seroquel along with all the other drugs mixed in and apparently he was a acting a bit weird at my mates when he got back from town said he seen some people fighting in someones driveway when clearly no one was and then we think he went home and may have had a xan or val or something along the lines to calm down as he normally would and this may have tipped him over.  


My mates woke up and found G in there backyard walking around with a box cutter knife almost like he had a purpose dropped it and went to play with some plants while staring up at the sky. by these point my mates knew something was wrong so took him home to his mums after he started seeing and talking to people that weren't there like he would look out the window and say whats that caravan doing over there and then start giggling and laughing with his mates that weren't even there. My mate said he was making coffees and putting them in rooms all around the house for people that weren't there and just completely wasn't on this earth anymore.   


They took him to hospital and he started freaking out apparently 8 security guards had to hold him down while they did every test possible and couldnt even work out what was wrong or what he had taken so after everything they put him in a coma and he has been since..  


Anyone know or understand what could have happened here? he did the anti psychotics with a friend and this guy is a bit of tripped out dude anyway but aparently he was okay, but is having episodes. Like when G went into a coma he messaged the one guy that knew, as we all found out later on, and said he could see G floating in front of him in a coma and he hadnt even known G was in hospital. he also said he could see peoples white siloets around the room

"underweight and healthy? (15.8 bmi) hi!! i’m a super tall 19 year old girl (6’2 and a half—not trans just very tall genes) and i weigh ~125-130 pounds. this weight puts me at a BMI upwards of 15.8, which is severely underweight. i have maintained this weight for about 8 months. my highest weight was 168 in 2015 (did not restrict), but it dropped to 135 in 2016 (restricting), rose to 145-158 in 2017 (tried restricting but failed), and i started losing again summer of 2018. this is the longest i’ve maintained a weight and i am extremely happy with how i look. 

i’m not sure if i’m even anorexic. I don’t strictly count calories, but usually consume ~1300-1600 a day, which is a very rough approximation due to the fact that i eat out regularly, don’t weigh my food, and graze of handfuls of random food throughout the day that i don’t count. besides walking, i don’t really exercise, because i honestly don’t have the energy and it kinda hurts my bones/joints. 

i’m very social and spend time with friends every day, and usually eat with them too. i honestly feel like i eat a normal amount of food—at least for someone a foot shorter than me. nothing is really off-limits to be honest, and i eat big meals too (for example, i had an entire chipotle burrito last night—with guac).  it’s been super easy for me to maintain this weight through slow eating (usually spending an hour eating each meal; with friends, i usually eat half the meal, say i’m full and finish the rest at home because i’m SUCH a slow eater and i’d rather have them think i don’t eat a lot than lose out on enjoying my food). due to my height, i feel like i need to eat even MORE to maintain a healthy weight, which begins around 150 pounds for someone my height. however, i used to be this weight (as i previously mentioned) and was extremely miserable and cried all the time about how i looked. mentally, i was an absolute wreck. 

right now, i don’t really have many complications at this weight. maybe it’s because i haven’t been at this weight for a very long time, but i’ve only experienced leg/knee pain off-and-on and coldness and dizziness. my periods are very regular. the main thing i’ve noticed is that i’m never super satiated, like my stomach can be very bloated and full after eating a big &amp; balanced meal but i still want more sometimes. but for the most part i’m fine. 

i honestly feel like my body is adapting to it’s current weight. i’m physically full most of the time and have never been more social and relaxed about food. i eat large portions of mostly whole, plant-based foods and RARELY empty calories, and do not rely on diet soda/coffee/tea to fill me up. i do not overexercise in the slightest.

"A 5yo with PTSD My 5yo daughter was recently diagnosed with PTSD and severe separation anxiety. Her father killed himself in front of her nearly two years ago. She was alone with him for at least an hour before I found them. 

She has severe behavioral issues at school now, and severe anxiety at home. At home, if I’m out of sight for just a few minutes she will have a panic attack. I mean, just taking out the trash or doing the laundry sends her sobbing in fear that I’ve died. 

At school, her anxiety seems to manifest as anger. She pushes, hits, throws things, hurts other kids, tries to run away. She’s already had to leave one school and was suspended a couple of weeks ago from her new one. Yesterday was so bad she bruised a teacher’s stomach, pulled another’s hair out, threw a chair at the kids, scared some of them so badly they hid under tables, and then she *choked* one of the kids. When they removed her so she couldn’t hurt any of the kids or the teachers, she started clawing at herself and digging into her own arms.

I have her in regular therapy, music therapy, and a sport (I thought physical activity would help as an outlet). But things seem to be getting worse? I’m so alarmed and shocked by the choking (where would she even learn that) and self harm. Is this kind of rage “normal”? Her next therapy appointment isn’t until Wednesday, so I have what feels like ages until I can bring this up.

I’m worried as well that I keep getting suicidal. And when I do it seems so rational. I don’t want to end up doing something stupid on the spur of the moment just because it seems like a good idea. 

When it passes I’m always so glad I didn’t do anything.

But I also never tell anyone when I get like that. I don’t want them to worry about me. Or think I’m being over dramatic or saying it for attention.

My ex used to use suicide threats as a way to control me. I never want to make anyone feel like that.

"I wish I was neurotypical for a cornucopia of reasons I've felt really bad about being autistic recently. I don't like being autistic. I don't like having shitty social abilities and I don't like having weird special interests (my special interests are things like opera and the warrior cats book series, those aren't useful abilities at all) and I don't like feeling so stupid all the time. I feel like a massive burden to those around me. I can tell the people around me hate the fact I have autism. For example, I had a friend a couple months ago that was acting rather selfish and manipulative at the time, and when I attempted to gently put my concerns into words she went scorched earth on me and told me, among plenty of other very insulting things, that I was difficult to be around and a hassle to her because I was autistic. I cut off that friend really quick after that, but that, along with trying to look at a good university to get into and seeing how they treat autism, has just made me feel terrible about being autistic and I don't know how to really... cope with the fact that I'm just going to be this obnoxious, useless hassle to everyone else for the rest of my life.

"To have an intervention or not? I'm writing this post as a 28 year old daughter of an alcoholic. He's struggled for most of his life with this but for the most part has been tolerable to us children and my mom. My parents have been married for 26 years as of today.

He was doing okay when I graduated high school in 2009. At that point I moved out of state. I visited in 2014 and during those few months my dad was arrested for DUI and spent the night in jail. He lost his license and for the next 6 months my mom and two little brothers had to adjust their lives to help drive him to work and whatnot. There were clearly other things that happened that escalated this into being more serious. That was the last major thing until I moved back to my home state in 2017.

I don't live with them or visit enough to know the daily occurrences but my first Christmas home my mom and brothers pulled me aside and said we needed to have an intervention for my dad. He had turned into an angry person and was also smoking marijuana more and the relationship between all of them was very strained. We were planning the intervention for the following month however my older brother then got into some legal troubles and that had to be our priority.

By the time everything cool down enough we started to try to plan it a second time and right on cue my older brother got into legal trouble for the second time and this resulted in my niece and nephew living with my parents temporarily. These circumstances made it very difficult to try to plan or have an intervention for my dad. 

I woke up this morning to messages from my mom saying that this is the third night in a row she's had to pick up my Dad drunk and this time he was falling down and could barely walk was slurring his speech terribly and ended up pissing himself. My mom had just learned about the death of an employee and had a lot of phone calls to make and really needed his support. She is breaking down, and I can see it happening.

She told me that she's not sure what she will do when my younger brother's move out in the next year or two  and that the only option she sees is to divorce him  before things get worse. I can see all 3 of them living with him struggling and it's breaking my heart.

Obviously no child wants their parents to get a divorce  though I do understand that sometimes it's necessary. I told her that maybe now is the time that we have to make his intervention a priority to see if there is a chance at repairing their relationships. 

My question is this: is there anything family members can say or do that will show that this is truly the last straw and he needs to change? Or is this 100% his decision? If we have an intervention, I just want to be sure it's effective. I've done research, but maybe someone who has actually held one, or had one for themselves can help answer?",alcoholism,alcoholism
"Child Protection Worker Living Past Traumas I was diagnosed with PTSD in my early 20’s and had success with treatment in lessening my flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, and general feelings of anxiety. I felt like I was a success story. 

I wanted to become a social worker because I enjoy helping others and making them see the light I once thought did not exist. I still believe it is there. 

My experience was in school social work at the high school I graduated from. I also have been working as an associate psychotherapist to get my clinical hours for the next portion of my license. I feel like my empathy and first-hand knowledge have really helped me to connect with my clients. I have remained grounded and still considered myself to be a success story. 

Since April, I changed jobs to working as a child protection worker. I was positive I had overcome the triggers of my past and was ready to help children who deserved a voice and to feel safe. However, as of this month, my symptoms have started creeping back. I have been having high anxiety on a daily basis. I notice myself isolating more and more. I have been having difficulty sleeping in my apartment alone and tend to sleep over my mom’s house even though she is also a huge trigger to me. I have been having nightmares and find myself dissociating frequently. 

I wish I could take a mental health day or a vacation but I’m scared that my anxiety will get worse because the workload just piles up when you’re gone. I know I need to find a therapist and do self-care but I frequently work overtime and never have time with the two jobs I’m working. I also know that I keep coming up with excuses to not take care of myself. Don’t you hate it when you know the answer to feel better but you don’t take your own advice? Anyway, thank you for listening to me vent. I’m thinking of you all and remaining optimistic that I will feel like that success story again someday soon. I hope you guys do too. ❤️",ptsd,ptsd
"Is this stimming? Hi everyone. I'm 19 and I've had a suspicion for about a year now that I might be on the spectrum. Right now what I'm most curious about is whether or not what I do is stimming. Whenever I get very anxious, I either make a repetitive grasping motion or I ball my fist and bounce my forearm up and down. If I am around people, I can suppress the urge. Sometimes it is uncomfortable to stop it. For as long as I can remember, if I get happy enough I get this feeling in my chest like I need to do something but I've never been able to figure out what it was I wanted to do so badly. It mostly happened when I was listening to music, but now it's happening more often. I've been listening to a very funny and exciting podcast, and it gives me that urge more than anything else has before. I noticed I would start to wave my hands and stop myself, so the next time I started to do it I just didn't stop. It feels really good! I've been doing it a lot and I don't know why I've never done it before. Also, when I'm lost in thought I'll trace patterns over and over again either with my finger on my leg or my foot on the ground. I'm really curious. Are any of those things stimming? I have two anxiety disorders and a mood disorder. I'm not diagnosed, but I suspect I might also have ADHD because it runs in my family. I'm not sure if my repetitive behaviors can be explained by any of those. All I know for certain is that I love waving my hands around when I get happy because it feels SO good.",autism,autism

"question for those whose weight has yo-yo’d for how long did the rebound weight stick around when you tried losing again? 

background: I was losing slowly and steadily thru healthy eating for a year but suddenly jumped into low-moderate restriction using c/s. my rate of weight loss sped up, and I went down ~9 lbs over about 3 months and then stalled during December. had an extremely stressful January during which I switched to high restriction and b/p’d a few days. gained literally all of the weight back in pure fat. 

since the start of February I have kept my cals btwn 600 - 800 and stayed low carb (I have PCOS). I was worried my metabolism adapted after restricting for 3 months, so I tried reverse dieting the last 2 weeks and now eat more btwn 700 and 950 a day. my weight is still the same since the start of February. I watched the weight flux throughout my menstrual cycle/higher sodium/more active days, and my weight always settles around the same number. I still can’t fit into my pre-January clothes.

I feel like I've been experiencing psychotic symptoms for a while but am unsure if they are just normal experiences I am misinterpreting.

It started a couple years ago and I've never thought anything of it, but sometimes it feels like I hear someone inside my head talking but not answering back to me.  It tells me to do some stuff I'm obviously not okay with.  Example someone does something mildly irritating and it wants me to stab them in front of everyone and I get very vivid thoughts of me doing it and blood running down my hands in the future.  Starting my roommates bed on fire while he sleeps, ect.  I obviously don't react on anything because they aren't normal thought but in the moments I feel compelled to.

Sometimes colors shift in my eyes to lighter or darker shades and I feel in tune with the universe and get signs that tell me that I'm where I'm supposed to be.  I see patterns that match, listen to something and see an object talked about in the song, or even when I'm working out doing pullups I feel like I can somewhat communicate with the universe and it tells me how many I can do back to me so when I feel like I'm struggling at a point I always know I have more in myself to push more.

I always thought like the sounds and voices I hear were normal like dialogue with myself or just buzzing and stuff, but last night it felt different.  As I was sitting there I kept ""hearing"" a voice saying ""stop look, look"" and it wouldn't stop for what felt like a lengthy period of time and I didn't know what I'm supposed to be looking for.

"Stress is the keyword I always thought about my problem as an anxiety disorder or an obsessive disorder, but something didn't fit.

Reading through the book 'Principles' by Ray Dalio, in the chapter where he talks about the mind I found d this (page 220):

'That damned amygdala, which is a little almond-shaped structure that lies deeply embedded in the cerebrum, is one of the most powerful parts of your brain. It controls your behavior, even though you’re not conscious of it. How does it work? When something upsets us—and that something could be a sound, a sight, or just a gut feeling—the amygdala sends notice to our bodies to prepare to fight or flee: the heartbeat speeds up, the blood pressure rises, and breathing quickens. During an argument, you’ll often notice a physical response similar to how you react to fear (for instance, rapid heartbeats and tensing muscles). Recognizing that, your conscious mind (which resides in the prefrontal cortex) can refuse to obey its instructions. Typically, these amygdala hijackings come on fast and dissipate quickly, except in rare cases, such as when a person develops post-traumatic stress disorder from a particularly horrible event or series of events. Knowing how these hijackings work, you know that if you allow yourself to react spontaneously, you will be prone to overreact. You can also comfort yourself with the knowledge that whatever psychological pain you are experiencing will go away before very long.'

This is exactly how I feel a lot, 'hijacked'.

I can not related it with another feeling but with stress. 

The 'fight or flight' feeling. Sometimes I feel a lot of fear, and sometimes I am confrontational to an irrational level.

I was badly hurt physically when I was very young, which led to some physical growth problems. Since then I really didn't understand why I could be so stressed all the time. I'm glad this group exists, and I'm glad there is a way out.

"Digital help Dear reddit community, 

I recently got diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. 

my main struggle is oversensitivity to sensory impulses.   
I am trying to find all types of programs/add-ons and tools to make my digital experience less taxing on my daily sensory budget.   
What has been working for you??

What I'd like to find: a browser thats simpler and less input visually with all the different controls  


a list of things that seem to help me so far:

\-black background on all my browsing activity

  
\-CITYMAPPER instead of google maps for navigation (its soooo much chiller! reminds you to prepare for getting off first 2 mins then only a notification to get off. also includes a map and you see all stops and other times if you miss your bus or train. It's saving me so much anxiety influxes when I leave home

\-CASUAL.PM for project management and mapping out complex things like moving houses or figuring other things out. I had identified project management before as a potential help to make up for my loss of overview, but anytime I'd use one of those tools and put a project in, Id not be able to go in and edit and use it actually. [CASUAL.PM](https://CASUAL.PM) eliminates these problems by a simple user interface that is visual and without any hidden away screens or tabs. its very easy to move things around and doesnt cost much time to adapt. Its affordable and usable with a mentor or coach or something if you need that as extra team member. but its great for mindmapping basically about what you need to do and add deadlines and dependencies if needed (I dont really use this feature so far). This approach is helping me to get overview over complex sequences of actions and adapt it. because I then reach some overview, I can actually identify when Its too much for me or if I need to adapt the plan to make it work for me. and also to communicate and ask help and show what you are doing.   


\-DAYMATE is a super simple app with a routine for weekly tasks schedules. allows to add on a coach to monitor and report to. perfect for chores. there is a more advanced app from the same developers called ASSIST HELP

\-YNAB for budgeting. overview over my finances to make me have insights on what I can't and can spend. it is an app that helps you put your money to use by budgeting it for different expenses on a monthly basis. filling up every month and reporting it into the new month. I do weekly adding of transactions to monitor activity and adjust and be aware of the budget and how my money is going.

"Day 30 - Woohoo! In the fall of 2018 I set a date for myself to stop drinking, January 15th, I turned 50 in November.  I have been concerned about my drinking and wanting to quit for many years.  I tried all the things people try, I'll only drink on the weekend, only drink at social events, only drink 2 days a week, only have 2 drinks,  etc, etc. Which,  naturally never worked.  I remember reading somewhere that you should tell people you're going  to stop drinking,  they'll support you and it makes you accountable. So I did,  and it made the looming date more real. 
So I got really drunk on January 14th, as you do, and the next day I called someone I knew was sober 10 years and asked her to take me to an AA meeting. I had such a knot in my stomach making that call.  30 days later,  I honestly can't believe it, but here we are. 
I feel GREAT. I am so much more productive and well, not drunk &amp; hungover.  It's amazing.
 I do go to meetings at least once a week I am an atheist (and if you are in AA please don't tell me all that stuff I already know about is mor religion) I enjoy it for the fellowship and the shared and very familiar stories. Online I utilize agnostic, athiest &amp; freethinkers websites, literature and groups and that program which also has agnostic 12 steps. 
31 days ago I drank a handle of vodka a week and wine, prosecco, etc, etc. And now, well now I don't, now I choose each day not to drink that day.   If you've made it this far thank you, it feels pretty great. Looking forward to support &amp; the community here on this journey.

"Advice for speaking to parent with possible autism Background info: 
*I grew up in a household where my mother basically ran everything. 
*I know almost nothing about my parents except that they had an arranged marriage, and that he was bullied in high school. I was never able to, I don't know, I guess communicate to my dad. When I or any other member of the family speaks to him, he never makes eye contact and mumbles incoherently to himself. He also cannot stop cutting and taping papers back together, no matter how important they are. We never understand the words that he speaks, but we kind of understand what he says from his body language? I always thought this was normal, and everyone's dad was the same, but apparently not. I am currently being diagnosed with ADD, and my therapist suspects my dad has autism. I took a look at a few articles explaining the symptoms, and I'm absolutely crushed. It describes my dad to a T, but I know that he will never be able to get a proper diagnosis due to the stigma against therapy in my family. I was only ""allowed"" to get therapy because it was free (college) and because no one else in the family aside from my mother knows. If that's how it is, fine. But I want to communicate more with my dad. I want to get to know him better and appreciate him more. How can I do this? Thanks in advance.",autism,autism
"Nightmares that meds dont seem to help Its really weird before PTSD I used to never dream (or never remember them, if you believe everyone dreams).  I would have maybe 1 or 2 dreams a year.  Now pretty much every night is some form of a nightmare.  Some are violent, some are just shitty like putting my dog to sleep, naked in school, that kind of thing.  During shitty times I'll wake up 3 to 4 times a night.  

I've tried a lot of meds, prazosin, trazadone, gabapentine, hydroxyzine, vistaril.  Probably some others I dont remember.  The psyc isnt giving up and thinks there is something out there.

I'm starting to give up and think it will just be like this forever which is a depressing thought.  Im just tired of being tired.

For those that prazosin helped (since I keep hearing great stories of it working).  Did you tend to wake up paniced and moving around?  Most of mine I just wake up calm and remembering a shitty dream, my hearts not pounding, no adrenaline, so maybe thats why it doesn't work for me.  Also gave me heart palpitations which weren't comfortable.

"Mathematics (sorry if it’s been asked many times..) Recently diagnosed high functioning autistic.. have a 13 year old who also just got her HF diagnosis yesterday and I’m being told that with new studies they wouldn’t be surprised if my other 3 are on the spectrum to some extent themselves... 

But it seems everywhere I go to read or research since receiving my diagnosis, most of it fits but.. I’ve never been that good at math. I’m just curious if this is one of the many things they have mostly wrong? Sort of like the stereotype that if you are Asian you must be good at math...my 13 year old is entering 8th grade this year and her math tested at a 5th grade level. I know I always felt barely up to speed with the rest of my class on math or was possibly behind a year or two as well.. however I did know how to read before even entering school and always tested way above average for reading and reading comprehension as does my 13 year old.. due to bullying and other issues I had to drop out of school at 16 but on my GED testing all of my subjects (except math, lol) were in the mid college age range despite not even finishing the 10th grade..

"I wrote a poem to my wife (this ended up being really long by the time I contextualized the poem) I started drinking in 2007.  It got progressively worse (as it does).  Back then it was for fun, with friends, and I thought it made playing video games and entertaining myself really fun.  I then started to use it as a coping mechanism to deal with my ex-wife.  We divorced but I didnt stop drinking.

In the meantime (2013) I met and manage to woo the girl of my dreams.  Beautiful, smart, argumentative about religion, politics etc and never takes losing or winning a debate too far (we’ve only ever had 1 real argument in which we ended up upset)... I have, however, hurt her in drunken tirades.  She has always been stone cold when I get hostile, patiently waits out my fits, and then holds me while I sob myself to sleep.  A perfect angel whose love I’ve basically been abusing because I won’t stop drinking.  The awful things I have said in my angry drunkenness should have left me out in the streets alone.  But she never gave up on me.

I hit the lowest point in my life last February when I lost my job (actually for reasons not related to alcohol).  I could barely hold myself together, and my wife was there to glue me back together again.  Every hangover, every drunken fit, outrage, tantrum.  I was killing 15-20 beers a night, rapidly drinking right through our savings.  Didnt get another job until August.

In June she went into the hospital with chest pains caused by stress.

I was doing this to her, and even after a hospital visit, I didn’t see it.

I found Reddit in December of last year.  I started off on the typical funny subs or entertaining subs.  Then I don’t know how, but I stumbled onto some of the many support subs for alcoholics.

And it scared me shitless.  The consequences of drinking are all over the place.  I kind of had a wakeup call when I realized that thanks to my wife, I have probably been saved from DUIs and PI citations or worse.

I have been tapering down my drinking.  Around 6 a night.  I dont have insurance and live in the US, otherwise I would have checked into rehab already.  I looked at TSM and other alternatives... but right now I think my best bet is to taper out and then quit cold once I go a few days and make sure I dont get hit by DTs.  Regardless, I’m determined to quit and this is my first (semi) public acknowledgement of my intent to quit.  I am looking into my local AA resources, but I’m an agnostic bordering on atheism so I hope they’ll be open-minded about me clinging to an unconventional higher power on my journey through the steps.

Anyway, I wrote this poem for my wife to thank her for not giving up on me.  When we were dating I wrote her all kinds of poetry and I kept writing after we got married, but the worse my drinking got, even the poems stopped.  Here it is:

How all of it hurts you

Sick. Sad.
Can’t focus, blurry vision
I passed out in the floor again
Never bad enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Quiet. Sober.
Can’t stop shaking, still can’t focus
Your worry and concern showing again
Never bad enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Angry. Confused.
Can’t laugh, can’t cry
I diagnosed all of humanities problems again
Don’t care enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Awake. Anxious.
Can’t sleep, can’t rest
I drank a few beers less again
Starting to care and see
How all of it hurts me

Trapped. Concerned.
Can’t help, can’t stop it
The fear is in your eyes again
That’s when I knew
How all of it hurts you

Improving. Striving.
Can help, can stop
The color of our laughter painting happiness again
I’ll do what I need to do
So none of it hurts you

Clean. Sober.
You helped, I stopped.
Our lives are much better again
Thanks to you I could finally see
How all of it was hurting me

"My University promotes drinking with an official annual celebration and I could use some backup explaining why this is a bad thing to expose kids to Hey everyone, I attend the University of Calgary which has an annual celebration called ""BSD"" its a school (and liquor company) sponsored event that is centered around students drinking. The primary attractions are a ""boozy pancake breakfast"" (AM drinking) and a ""beer gardens"".

95% of the student populatuon ranges in age from 17-25. Ive tried to voice my opinion that absolutley no educational institution should be promoting alcohol consumption epecially given the young susceptible demographic that attends the UofC, however I have been met with increadibly toxic (and sometimes voilent) responses from the students who attend the UofC.

I fear much of this toxicity steams from very troubling loyalty to the act of drinking itself and it makes me very sad that so many young students are already devolping behaviour that either is or is related to alcoholism.

I would very much appreciate anyone who is willing to post on the r/Ucalgary subreddit and share any stories you may have regarding drinking in your youth or in university and how it affected your life or the lives of those around you. I think many of these kids havent come face to face with the consequences of thier actions and that a posting campaign from this community might help open thier eyes and mame a real difference at my school.

"Schizophrenia and Friends My friend has schizophrenia and I actually met him at the beginning of my college semester, he’s a really cool guy. He’s had some episodes in front of me and our friend group but generally its not that big of a deal, we get it. He actually revealed to me early on that he liked me and I told him all I could really offer him was friendship since I was already seeing someone and he told me he was okay with that.

Fast forward to now, we hung out yesterday and had a great time, today he’s talking about not being able to take it and not wanting to see me anymore. That despite me supporting him, he’ll always be alone, friendship or romantic wise. 

I guess I’m not really asking for advice, I just really want to know what having friends or romances are like for schizophrenics? Is it hard to keep people around? Are arguments triggering? Can you be yourself around the people you’re close to? Or just any general information, google doesn’t really help in that department. Surprisingly most of the results are catered to care takers, not really everyday friendly or romantic relationships.

I try to eat as much protein as possible (60-100g), but I feel like I'll never get the lean muscular body i desire with these bad habits...

But when we talk through texts...he texts me a lot and I can tell he wants to talk to me a lot, but he never asks questions about me. He just answers whatever I ask with a very simple, hard to respond to answer. Sometimes it leaves me thinking he may not want to talk to me, but when I don’t answer he’ll text again.

This is leaving me feeling very confused. It’s very hard to have a conversation with him. 

Otherwise we seem to have a lot in common and would have a lot to talk about if he asked me questions. He also works with adults with ASD which leads me to believe he is a caring person. 

Is this something that would be common with someone who has ASD? (It would be a relief to know it was ASD and not that he just doesn’t care what I have to say. Hahaha)

"So, I’m not autistic, but I’m concerned So I have a friend who is pretty much high functioning autistic. And I’m worried that his parents don’t know how to understand or care for him and the way that one needs to understand and care for somebody who experiences life on the spectrum. 
He has a very hard time living with his mother who holds him accountable for a lot of behaviorism‘s that are indicative of his condition. It’s gotten to the point where she is acting like she hates him and keeps threatening to put him in the state mental health treatment center for having “meltdowns” and accusing him of being “hateful” amongst other things. 
I’m so worried about him because all he wants to do is act “right “and be able to move out of his parents house, hold the job, and be away from his mother who makes him very uncomfortable, sad, and mad on a daily basis because of how they communicate.
I am his best friend and I want nothing but the best for him. I feel like living at home triggers his symptoms very badly as far as the “meltdowns “but I don’t know that he is in a place to be able to independently move out successfully just yet.
Is this a problem that anyone else has experience with their own parents or any friends parents? Have you seen anybody with autism suffer of the same way with trying to have family members understand their condition without judgment?

"Stimulants and Poor Circulation/Livedo Reticularis? I was diagnosed with ADD (now PI-ADHD) when I was nine years old and I took a dose of Ritalin every morning up until fifth grade because of weight issues and I restarted them in freshman year 2015.

If I don’t tap my feet or swing my legs or stand frequently my toes turn white and I can’t feel them, my fingers have been so cold that I couldn’t have my pulse taken.

"How Do I Help My Brother With Depression? My brother (20 M) has been showing signs of increased depression and anxiety ever since I (22 F) got married and moved out. We were (and still are) very close, so my absence has definitely been felt by him. I try to text him roughly every day, but sometimes he won’t write back. He’s told me he feels lonely, anxious, and sad. He’s also been having more meltdowns than he usually does. I moved to a different state 6 months ago and from what my mom has been telling me, his symptoms have been getting worse. He goes to school and has friends at youth group, but he’s still depressed. My parents offered to take him to a movie he’d been DYING to see and he turned it down. That’s not normal for him, considering he’d been OBSESSING over this movie since it was announced. 
My mom says he “just wants to be entertained” and that he “uses anxiety as a crutch.” She is t taking this seriously at all. He’s in therapy, but one hour a week doesn’t give one a lot of time to unpack all that’s going on the rest of the week, especially when you have a parent who refuses to understand and invalidates you. She did the same to me when I was dealing with anxiety and depression, and that lead to me being suicidal for a long time. I don’t want him to get to that point.
I’m thinking of writing a letter to his therapist and explaining what is going on. My brother doesn’t open up very easily, and he does make up reasons to keep people from figuring out what’s really the problem. He is usually very straightforward with me but not our parents. 
How can I help him? I’m so far away and our mom is very ignorant about mental health issues.",autism,autism

"How do you stop the Hyper Focus After lurking on this thread enough i know that Hyper Focus is defiantly something that i am not the only one that has issues with this. My question is how do you stop it? 

Me and my wife the other night got into a argument because i was bugging her too much with something i needed her to get done to get our house organized after moving, and you mix me pestering a puerto rican that is highly emotional due to a monthly ordeal she deals with and it leads to heated moments. As the night goes on, i go shopping and cool down, she does the same. 

Later that night and she feels guilty for not having energy for helping with what needs to be done after moving and everything with how busy her schedule is (which im fine with picking up the slack, she is hella busy). 

But later after things calm i realize i am hyper focusing. HOW DO I STOP THIS. I realize after all is done i was pestering way too much do to me hyper focusing and wanting this done and i was being way to pushy and should have backed off as it wasent a big deal it wasent done yet. (I noticed this stuff gets worse when i am stressed which i have been lately because of financial pressures from her school and debt and being the only income).

Just want to add i am new to medication, just started this week. 

tl;dr - hyper focusing on things that need to be done i am unable to do leads to me pestering a volatile puerto rican which leads to unnecessary arguing. Looking for tips on curbing my Hyper Focusing. New to medication.

"Good books/articles for ADHD people about how to succeed? Hello friends! 

So I’m in college, 21, and have been diagnosed with ADHD (predominantly inattentive, so technically ADD) for about a year now. I’ve been taking meds during that time and it’s wonderful to help me be able to focus. 


I still have a few issues though. The fact that I can focus now is wonderful! However getting focused on something that doesn’t interest me is extremely difficult. Making that first sometimes seems impossible. So, my room, car, life, is basically still a disorganized mess.

Along with that, I’ve got the self confidence and the large fear of rejection/failure issues as well. I’ve thought for a long time that that just the way I am, until after reading a few articles I realized that these issues often occur in people with ADHD.



 I know I should probably try to see a therapist to help with that but it’s just not affordable for me right now.

So, I want to know if anyone has good suggestions for how ADHD people can deal with these problems? I dunno, I just need something to help me work on my thought processes.

I’m tired of constantly being a mess. I’m tired of irrationally thinking people dislike/hate/are mad at me. I’m tired of feeling I’m a huge fat failure at everything I do. (I rationally know that I’m not, but I still feel that way)

So I would love some recommendations from people who understand the struggle. Thanks :)",adhd,adhd

"Need advice for how to survive PA school with ADD (inattentive, not hyperactive)! Hi! So, I just discovered reddit today actually while I simultaneously discovered this ADHD forum, and I could not be happier to be reading so many relatable posts. I feel like people with ADHD can feel so isolated. 

I'm going to try to cut to the chase. My ADD stayed undiagnosed for most of my life because I would get good grades by spending WAY too much time studying/doing homework. I worked really, REALLY hard and it showed. Meanwhile, I would always barely finish exams (or sometimes not finish them at all), my friends refused to study with me because I was distracting or couldn't keep up with them, I can't hear myself think if people are around me making any noise whatsoever, I literally can't do anything unless it's absolutely last-minute, I am very impulsive, etc. etc. Once college rolled around, I talked to my doctor because I couldn't study with friends or peers because I couldn't focus, I couldn't keep up, and I couldn't stop myself from continuously pulling my friends off-task or to a topic we weren't currently focusing on. She prescribed me Adderall and sent me on my way.

Fast forward, I applied to PA school (literally on the last day that the applications were due, might I add) and got into a few of them. I went to PA school (my first-choice program- I was very excited and grateful) for three months and then, after a lot of struggling and a lot of tears, I had to withdraw. 

Here were my problems: I am EXTREMELY detail-oriented. Everything has to be just-so. I have always thought of myself as a perfectionist. When I study, I always need to study every teeny tiny little detail so that I understand ALL OF IT. This worked for me in school, but NOT in PA school. I would struggle to grasp the big pictures of topics, and there is simply not enough time to spend so much time on every little detail. So, not only was I focusing on all the wrong things when I studied, but it just generally took me longer to grasp information than my peers. Meanwhile there is barely enough time to learn all the information for the average PA student, let alone someone with ADD. 

All my professors I talked to and tried to confide in pretty much talked to me as if I just wasn't studying correctly and wasn't good at time management. Although technically this was true, it didn't seem fair. I really couldn't help it, and I had been doing these things for my ENTIRE LIFE and managed to get amazing grades, so how was I supposed to change everything in the middle of PA school? 

Sorry, that was way longer than I'd hoped it would be... But can anyone relate? Are there any PA student ADDers out there? Does anyone have any advice as to how I can control my studying to focus on the right topics, or any advice at all for someone with ADD in an intensive grad program?

ANY help would be appreciated. I'm so glad I've found a place to express my concerns. I'm quickly losing confidence and need to figure out how I can succeed because I truly feel my passion is for PA, and once I am an actual PA... I would be a great one. Thanks so much! (-:

"My relationship keeps triggering me and I dont know what to do My boyfriend is a good bf. I just came from super shitty relationships. And now i dont know what to do with them. 

 My first boyfriend played so many mind games and raped me a lot. It was my first relationship and I felt really scared to leave or he'd kill himself. When i broke up with him he wrote an 11 page letter on how I should go to hell and that hes going to kill himself because of me. Then my next relationship was hard because i was really really in love and he was an abusive narcissistic person, i felt like that whole relationship was a lie. After that I was in a bunch of pointless shit. 

I struggled with sex addiction, borderline drug abuse at 19, losing jobs, etc... Now im diagnosed with bipolar too. 

Its been a fucking struggle. Some days i want to end it. 

Now im in therapy and I take meds. However, My relationship now triggers me so much. My bf is good to me, hes smart and creative. Hes very optimistic and funny. He treats me well and likes to spoil me. The catch? I can't even take half of it. I feel like its all a lie and I always think about leaving. That's not fair to him. I want him happy. And i do love him, but I just dont love myself in the slightest. I compare myself all the time to him and I think why cant i be better like him. Then i start hitting low lows. And it doesnt stop.

We broke up briefly and he'd message me everyday and i ended up getting back together and now i just feel sad again. I want to be happy for him and be a good partner, i just keep fucking comparing so much. He doesn't understand mental illness much nor really understand a lot of my struggles but hes still supportive regardless. I wish i was more normal, im so confused. 

What should I do? :-(

I'm a 25 year old male, started drinking about 13 and then heavily from about 16 or so.  
Started getting withdrawals somewhere in my early 20s.

It's happened before but alcohol is starting to have a major negative impact on my life.

Nevermind the health implications I started a new job about a month and a half ago and I've had mild withdrawals twice within that time. I'm verbally abusive to my girlfriend when I'm drunk. I lost all of last weekend, on the Friday I hit on all of my long term girlfriends friends whilst in the pub with her, on the Saturday I tried to touch up my best friends SO which resulted in us kicking the shit out of each other.

I need to do something about this but I really don't want to. I managed to not drink for a bit, 9 months in total. Someone told me once it took 6 months of not drinking before our livers started repairing themselves which meant mines had 3 months rest in 9 years. I don't think I can do AA, I'm not a big fan of groups or the whole religious aspect and aside from a court ordered councilor I've never spoken to a professional about this.

I know I need to cut out drink but I neither want to nor know how.

"When getting an updated ADHD evaluation, should you stop taking meds? I got evaluated for ADHD as a teenager and when I was 19, but had to get retested in order to provide an up-to-date evaluation so I could get accommodations on a standardized exam. Results just came back and apparently I don't have ADHD anymore, just test anxiety. Weird. I'll still probably get accommodations for the anxiety, in any case. 

But what hasn't been sitting right with me is that for my last evaluation, I was medicated for half of the sessions and unmedicated for the other half so the evaluator could have a baseline to compare to. I did this recent one entirely on meds per the instructions of the facility. Isn't there some kind of standard procedure here? Can they really assess me for ADHD properly when I'm on medications to make me less ADHD? (Especially since, when I questioned the facility's findings, they suggested that I go to my PCP and titrate down my medications, ""and if your symptoms come back, I guess you do have ADHD!"")

For those of you who have been re-evaluated after your initial diagnosis, did you take meds, or was there any notable difference in the evaluation process? Did your results change? Am I just being overly attached to a diagnosis I've grown out of?

"my story can help you Hi there guys, now that im heading to a new battle in my gambling addittion i can start with this phrase ""screw it, i will make it"". becouse even though im in a bad spot i got enough support to help me. But thats not the spirit of the post, as you read this you can check my story and see how much ive evolved as a human being. 

Lets start by saying im diagnosed with bipolar and zchizohrenia, at an old age, 27. But taking meds and treatment since my crisis at 18. After a long time ive had sucess in this battle. Got a book thats going to be published dezember, lost 24 kilos in 4 mnths, much more confident and healthy, crises dont come that often but when they do its a quick hit, with the help of family, the few friends and my beloved terapist im looking the world in a much simple way. I will never be 100% ok. but the fact that im going to college next year and im not sobbing and taking SOS pills all day helps alot. ask me all you want about that recovery so i dont post a bible post lol. bless you all",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Is my bullimia a coping mechanism ? Recently, I just moved to a new college, to another country far away from my family and friends. I felt so alone and lonely as college did not start yet and I'm all day everyday, sitting all alone at home. 
It all started when I got into dieting approximately one year ago, I used to be, let's say at a normal weight, I thought if I lose some few pounds I would ''feel better about myself''. I always failed, until one time I restriced to one small meal a day and lost a lot of weight in less than a week, and since it wasn't a realistic way ti live I had to maintain this weight, hence, discovered purging, it first started by exercise, I couldn't stand it since it's super hot where I live so I got myself into self-induced vomitting. I did gain the weight back but I got stuck into this cycle, dieting for a week losing weight, purging, binging, gaining weight, dieting, etc...
At some point I got so used to vomitting everything I ate that my face got super swollen and even some veins appeared on my face, I got so concerned I was like this needs to stop. 
And this is how my new purging method arised, I started practining what is called c/s also known as chewing and spitting and as the name suggests I started to chew and spit food, sometimes all the food, sometimes only the ''unhealthy'' foods... It became a habit in such a short period, it made me depressed, I was like once I move abroad, alone, I will stop this! But who I'm I kidding, it only got worse now that I'm alone, instead of just dealing with how bad,bored and lonely I feel. I get my hands on whatever food there is and start doing it! It's as if it became a coping mechanism at this point, I do it at every meal, I even started buying unhealthy food just to chew and spit them... And of course I swallow half of it since it's so much food now. At this point I don't care about how I look, I just want this to stop, not just me spitting the food but also chewing it, is this still bulimia or just an ''advanced'' form of BED? Did I just go from anorexia to bullimia and now it's becmoing BED ? Is that even possible ? Oh and I forgot to mention, I haven't got my period since 6 months, nevertheless my BMI is normal and I do eat each meal and get all my nutrients the only thing wrong is that I c/s HUGE amounts of food, I'll get broke at this point. 
&gt;Lads, First time posting here, I have nobody to talk to as no one knows about my ED, it's really hard for me to open up so yeah, hope someone reads this, I'm not specifically looking for help, just wanted to rant, haven't talk to a human being since ages (aside from skype family calls) so yeah...",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"Do I have PTSD and should I see a therapist for it? (TW Violence/abuse) So a little backstory. I’m a 20yo female. My mom and dad had a divorce as he was an abuser.

I had seen my dad and mom argue when I was only 5 years old but didn’t think anything of it, even when the police were at the house (I still remember it due to the TV static screen) But I started really noticing it when my dad got drunk and I heard shouting. I won’t go into detail as I get sick just thinking about it but every time I was over, from 2008-2015, (so age 9 to 16) my dad would get drunk and I’d have to listen to what happened to my stepmom.

"First Reddit Post. Have I Become an Alcoholic? Hello,

I really have to type this out to someone. This is my very first post on Reddit, and I feel like my life is slipping away from me. What do you guys think?

I never had a of problem with alcohol (I think). I used to be able to grab a six pack, sit back and watch a couple of movies, and then I wouldn't even want to drink for a long period. I could easily go a couple of months without drinking, and didn't even have to think about it. I was never much a party animal or anything like that, and never was big on bars. I didn't even like alcohol very much. I would just turn it down more often than not, even it was free. It would make me queasy half of the time.

However, over the last year I think I have become an alcoholic or at least a serious alcohol abuser. One year ago I was a single 31 year old guy who had a decent job, no debt, and got along great with my coworkers and friends. I used to smoke a lot of weed in the past, but for whatever reason my desire to do so began fading around age 30-31. But as luck has it, I suddenly developed a new desire to drink alcohol. It was like as soon as the desire for weed left, I started wanting to drink and it just hit me like a train. It just started affecting me differently for some reason and alcohol began to feel really good.

I specifically remember getting whiskey for Thanksgiving 2018 and spent the day off of work and watched some old Western movies by myself. No big deal I thought. But for some reason, it was like from that point on I started drinking very frequently, and the amount and frequency increased to where I was drinking more or less daily by sometime in January 2019.

I moved into a newly created sales position at my same company in January, cold-calling people all day. It turned out to be nothing like what I was promised. As the position was consolidated over the next couple of months the true details new position became cemented by upper management, and it became apparent that I was effectively getting a paycut, and had to hit ridiculous numbers like so many sales positions demand of you. I really felt lied to and even though I could pull it off, I hated the work either way. It screwed up my confidence so much, and my positive ""let's-do'it"" demeanor really changed, and I started getting more and more depressed, regardless of how much I tried to keep up appearances. I met a girl at my company and started dating her and had lots of good times with her, but for whatever reason my drinking continued to escalate.

We went to a sales conference on the other side of the country (Florida) in late March, and I spent the entire time drunk from morning to night. My girlfriend was there too, but I don't think she knew I was also hitting up restaurants in during brunch time and grabbing beer then as well. I would later on meet up with her, take her to dinner, and drink more.

So since then in March my drinking skyrocketed. I used to be 6'4 and a slim 200, but within two months I gained 50 pounds and had to buy all new jeans, dress shirts, etc. because my old stuff won't even fit me anymore. My whole personality has changed, and so has my sex drive and my zest for life. I began to grow distant from my girlfriend and eventually just stopped caring in June. I was just sitting around drinking. I told her I started drinking heavily and really needed help, and she told me she wanted to break up. I didn't even care, the whole time I was just thinking about when the conversation would be over so I could go get drunk. 

So I told my boss I was drinking too much, and needed help, and I went on leave from work for two months. Of course, I thought I would just stop drinking during that time, start meditating again, get a healthy diet again - but you guessed it, I spent the whole time getting wasted by myself, watching porn, listening to music. On July 4th, I sat there by myself and drank a total of 30 beers and ciders. No joke. I had so much depression and anxiety, that I couldn't even go out to do anything. ""What was the point?"", I thought. I couldn't just have one drink, I had to get really drunk, even thought it wasn't fun I just kept doing it. Within 9 or 10 months I have gone from having no debt to racking up over $10,000 in credit card debt, mostly from drinking and ordering food from restaurants to eat when drunk.

Fun fact: My dad is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for over 30 years, and my grandfather died in his sleep from drinking. So, yes, it's in my family for sure. During my leave I reached out to my dad and kept telling him I was slipping into heavy drinking. He has always been a good guy and very supportive, but I don't think he understood the scope of what I was doing. I eventually came back from leave to my job and still hated it. So I went on leave again and this time decided to fly out to see my parents in Maryland, with the idea that I needed some support from my family, and that I would stop drinking during my week there. Instead I showed up and drank a 12-pack each night at their house. They became very concerned. Within a week of returning from that trip I just broke down crying in the Target shopping center and called each of them, feeling suicidal. I have scheduled another flight to go see them on October 12th, this time for two weeks, and they specifically told me I can't have any alcohol in the house and I need to use the time to sober up.

I really don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but I had anxiety and some before my drinking escalated, and drinking has really made them several times worse. When I was in my early 20's I went on antidepressants and they never helped me. I changed my life back then by eating healthy (vegetables, green juice), and by meditating and trying to get out. I know I have to do the same thing now, but I just can't stop drinking. Hopefully during my next trip to my parents on the 12th I can get two weeks under my belt, and really make a permanent change. I really feel like I have become someone who can either drink all the time, or not at all. It's like there's no in between for me, and the craziest part is I don't even like it when I'm drunk, and it has all happened so suddenly. I feel so depressed when I'm not drinking and just feel like a failure.

Edit: a couple people asked what dissociation feels like for me. It varies a lot, and depends on the severity. At its mildest, I am just ""spacey"" like people usually associate with ADHD, and my mind is always a little foggy and detached. At its worst, I am totally out of it, and for example if someone is talking to me I can't understand what they're saying no matter how hard I try.

"Loss of personality, loss of direction. For the most part I’m a people pleasing happy guy who really Just acts on whatever comes to mind. I was diagnosed with ADHD a little over a year ago, in the beginning I was prescribed focalin but that turned me into an absolute zombie. I was dead and it wasn’t during the come down. I wouldn’t talk to anyone I would get so focused into something that when someone broke that focus I would get extremely irritated. These side effects really didn’t start coming up until my 4th month of use. After those 4 months I was prescribed 30mg(I believe) vyvanse. About 2 weeks had passed and I really didn’t feel anything. But just a short time after that my life changed. I don’t know what it was. I was gaining friends. Nothing could make me mad, I was outgoing, I was organized and happy for almost 95% percent of the time. These joy rides on vyvanse of sheer focus and optimism is something I miss. Up until 2018 hit, I noticed some of the effects I got on focalin to come back, I was soon very anti social(very very unlike me). I would get long spells of depression or sadness like no other. I then would turn angry after taking my 5mg adderall booster shortly after a school day to maintain focus on my homework. I get these Anxiety moments through out my day and hear the voice in my head very vividly telling me I’m dumb, unorganized, I peaked, all this bad shit i would’ve never thought off. It’s worthy to note that literally the second 2018 struck I got into a relationship. (My past lasted a year and was very emotionally abusive and toxic). Just as a recap. Focalin first, After my big relationship I took vyvanse 20 or 30MG can’t quite remember, in this new relationship I just recently got upped to 40 then 50mg. Today was my first day of 50mg and I Just don’t know how to feel. How do I get these defeating voices in my head to quiet down?

"Small rant on finding out I may still have ADHD. **TL;DR: I had ADHD as a kid, and social problems more recently, but I assumed that was all gone. I just learned I still might have ADHD, and that ADHD causes social problems. I finally did research, and found all my problems listed as symptoms. This could be confirmation bias. This is very worrisome to me.** 

The Rant:

(warning: bad writing ahead.)

I was on a date last night, with someone who I have been seeing-ish for about a month now. Over dinner, the conversation slowly led to me casually saying I had ADHD when I was much younger, which is something I almost never talk about. She surprised the hell out me by responding with, ""Oh, I was thinking you had ADD or ADHD! But I wasn't sure which one."" She told me to not be offended, because she was a school teacher and trained to look for these things.

I was taken aback. I asked her what I was doing to make her think that, trying to think of times I acted hyper or obnoxiously loud around her. She surprised me once more by saying, ""**It's nothing big, but you kind of avoid eye contact a lot. And sometimes you're socially awkward.""**

This has messed me up for the past day.

I have never done any research on ADHD, I just remember the criticisms I had when I was a kid. I was ""bouncing off the walls"", loud, constantly interrupting or attempting to dominate conversation, never concentrated on anything and made poor grades.

Since then, especially in my early 20's, people told me I was quiet, never talked, super calm. With much difficulty, I was able to make it through college. Because of this, I assumed I no longer had ADHD. After all, that's just for kids.

**ADHD, as far as I knew, was just hyperactivity and inattentiveness. It had nothing to do with self-esteem and social problems.**

I know that even as far as three years ago, I had a lot of social awkwardness, and very low confidence. But until yesterday, I believed I had turned all that around. People invite me places. I can invite people to places, and they come. It's easier to interact with people. Starting last year, I can talk to women and go on dates. I thought I was looking people in the eye. I thought I was finally normal.

But now everything is upside down. **I've been told I still have social awkwardness, and eye contact problems. What's more, I am surprised to learn that these are symptoms of ADHD.**

**Last night, I spent time first looking up social symptoms of ADHD in adults, and the all symptoms in general. All the problems I determined I had these past few years (social, organizational, or otherwise) were all listed.**   

I know that most people did not tell me I was being socially awkward, I had to figure that out for myself, and fix it for myself. I thought it was fixed. **But now I have evidence that I still say/do things routinely that is really dumb, and make people cringe, but no one is telling me. This is stressing me out tremendously.**

This is shocking, and I don't know what to make of the fact I may still have ADHD. Do you remember the final scene from The Usual Suspects, where the interrogator has a sudden, final revelation about Kyser Soze? That's how I'm feeling. **I understand (and hope) that this is all just some sort of confirmation bias.** 

Thanks for allowing me to rant. I apologize for the length, bad writing, and if I broke any of the rules. I also apologize if this post came across as cringe-y, or just awkward in general.

"Feeling Like No One Believes Me So I've been going to a therapist/psychatrist for about a year, treating depression and anxiety. I refused to get help for a long time because my parents are very against doctors and therapy/medication. Honestly, I am 95% sure my mom has ADHD and I believe doctors have tried to tell her that before but she refused to hear any of it. I've always worried about the possibility of having ADHD because of lots of little things. Basically everyone just labeled me as forgetful and clumsy so I accepted it at that.

So a few months ago, I brought this up to my psychatrist and he put me on a very small dose of adderall. I thought it was weird because he didn't really ask me any questions or do any tests, just that he wanted to see how I was on medication. The first day my focus was much better, but after that it just seemed to make me feel even more tired (I have sleep problems). So he took me off it and decided to put a pin in it until we got my other meds sorted out.

Lately it seems to be getting worse, at least in the sense of putting me in danger. I thought I turned off the stove last Saturday, but I just put it low enough for the flame to go out and the gas still going. I did not notice until 30+ mins lately. I also am getting really distracted by houses and trees when I'm driving (I commute an hour to work) and find myself drifting into the other lane often.

So I brought it up with my mother (I moved back into my parents house a few years ago, I am 27F) and she was worried about me doing that stuff until I brought up ADHD and talking to my doctor about it. She started saying how ever since I started going to that doctor they seem to find more and more wrong with me. That many things are just my personality and things I have to learn to overcome on my own, even if it means setting alarms for simple stuff. So I dropped it.

Today, I had an appointment with my psychatrist, but this is the last time I am seeing him since the office is closing. He decided to not change any of my meds because I will be seeing someone new soon. Which I can understand, but when I brought up the things I mentioned before about ADHD he told me ""I just think you're a blonde."" 

I feel like no one is taking me seriously. It makes me wonder if it really is just my fault and I can somehow be better. I did do really well in school, 3rd in my class in High School and 4.0 at the community college I went to, but I can never focus on lectures. I always had to do something else while listening, like drawing or origami, which I did get in trouble for occasionally. ",adhd,adhd

"Tips on getting to the point faster in work discussions? I have a new management job that requires me to explain and discuss often complex situations with senior leaders. When I have time to prepare I’m much better at keeping it pared down to key points, but in live conversations I talk way too much! I end up giving all the facts because I can’t pick out on the fly which ones are the most crucial and I’m afraid I’ll miss the important ones. I can see I’m wasting their time but I can’t do anything about it and it’s really embarrassing.

"I feel unsure and like I'm making things up I have just now began to entertain the idea of possibly having psychosis/ schizophrenia. But I feel like since I have a lot of insight and my hallucinations and few and far between, that I'm making it all up?

Like, maybe I just want attention or to have a ""real"" diagnosis (I currently am in the hospital for depression, and have been since March. Which feels like a ""not-real"" diagnosis because it's not able to be seen.)

A couple of years ago I believed there were shadow people following me, and I didn't leave my house until I was forced to by my mom, and came back home when she recognized I was having a breakdown. I didn't tell anyone about the shadow people, and ripped up and destroyed the drawings and writing I made about all that. Because I think I made it up for attention or something? Maybe to make myself feel better or special? I also can't remember this time very well.

And sometimes I hear voices, like people talking in a diner, or someone calling my name. Usually when it's quiet. I feel like my brain is just trying to fill the silence though. And I recognize that it's not real. And it doesn't happen super often.

I also have periods of time that I believe I'm in hell/purgatory. Or that I'm the only real person, or this is all a simulation or something. But most of the time I only kind of entertain the idea, I rarely- if ever- believe it fully. Just kind of.

Writing all this down, I honest to god think I'm doing this for attention or to have a real diagnosis. Maybe none of this is real. Maybe I'm doing this because my family might take me seriously now? I don't know.

I **will** tell my doctor, and I brought up a very little portion of this to my therapist, but I want to know what you guys think? And please, please consider that I'm lying or something. Or making it up. Not maliciously, but I really can't believe that this is real. I don't fucking know.

What do you think?

"Program denies my problems I went to a program to get a diagnosis on whats wrong with me. I hear things and see things. Sometimes good and sometimes bad. I warned them about my ADD but that info went through one ear and out the other. My ADD has caused me to create some coping strategies as a kid that may be linked to some signs of schizophrenia. Maybe um like day dreaming becoming more realistic type shit... anyway so they instead said i had a mild psychosis because i smoke weed. Well even after telling them i manage my dosages they didnt care. They said here r some meds please take them and we will further know about ur problems. I obviously did not. I would never take drugs from a facility that doesnt even listen to my trauma or life story but it got me thinking. Maybe its all in my head but how would I know right?

"family member with stage 4 cirrhosis relapsing... what to do? A family member in her late 40s just got out of their her first stint in rehab (90 days) and came out to living alone for the first time in her life in a apartment and it appears she is drinking again... lying about it to everyone after 14 days out of rehab.  She actually went to an AA meeting two days ago and was asked to take a breathalyzer because they suspected her of drinking.  She declined very angrily and left, not to return.  We found out about it and now no one knows how to handle getting her back into rehab.  

She says she's not drinking and that everyone riding her will drive her to drink...  I wasn't helping with the last placement in rehab but I was around for the holidays this year during this relapse and have since done a lot of research regarding rehab programs.  I have come to realize that that the aftercare part of her first release was nonexistent.  I called a different and more comprehensive rehab program (as compared to her last rehab) that utilizes a sober house w/ outpatient intensive for months following a patient's release.  My research leads me to believe that for someone in her situation to have a chance of success this part of the equation must be part of her aftercare plan.  Am I misreading this?   I understand that interventions are controversial, but she has stage 4 cirrhosis and is on the transplant list... a relapse appears to be potentially deadly, and quickly.  Is my medical research about this accurate?

She is livid at all of us for doubting her veracity about relapse, but she keeps lying about things... a hallmark of her drinking behavior in the past, and she recently smelled of alcohol or mouthwash (?).  My family is out of their depth, as am I, and we could definitely use some advice regarding the use of a professional intervention specialist.  Also, her children (teens) are not living with her and will not be involved in an intervention... and she is separated from her spouse.  What should we do?  The professional intervention specialist is ready to go but everyone is confused about the best plan of action.  She claims her therapist says she should not return to rehab and there is a theoretical planned phone call between her therapist and my family today.  She set it up, so let's see.  Her therapist predates her stint in substance abuse and my family doesn't know him.  But he does exist because I spoke with him briefly once before.  I'm really confused on how to proceed.  Help?

"Feeling quite depressed, my Mum's addiction is my responsibility. (Throwaway for obvious reasons) I'm writing this cause I'm in desperate need of help, I pray for a solution, or at the very least someone to talk to since I have nobody.

Fuck my life. I tried writing a story 6 times but I can't make it flow well so I'll just go for it and submit whatever I write now. I'm 17 year old, on my last year in the IB and I'm out to university. Since before I was born my Mum has used alcohol as a coping mechanism to deal with her problems. My Dad has tried pretty much everything to solve her addiction but she doesn't seem to want it to be solved so we're helpless. I have basically been ""tasked"" with dealing with her drinking problem and I've never done this before, I always used to ignore the arguments and everything by just hiding in my room preoccupying myself with video games. My sister used to be the one to interrogate her or try to cheer her up out of it while my Dad always threatens to leave her whenever she drinks which doesn't help cause it just makes her drink more. She's been in and out of drinking, sometimes not drinking at all for a few months and she always ends up back drinking since apparently ""nobody appreciates her effort"" even though she knows it should be expected of her to not drink. She seems like a much happier person when sober and I love her to death when she is, but she's just a fucking burden when she's drunk. I'm sorry to sound like an asshole but she makes EVERYTHING her problem. My dad has recently had a few heart issues and she was crying because it was HER burden to deal with - like what the fuck, my Dad is fine with it and has  gotten the correct medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway sorry for my blabbering, as you read I've been ""tasked"" to deal with her problem. What the hell do I do? I cannot just let her be like this because its a struggle living with her like this, she can't do any basic tasks and she's extremely clumsy. All she does in the day is cook and then lie in bed all day watching movies or going on social media - her way of escaping life, like me with video games.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? I've tried some of the things below:

Do I force myself upon her and take the wine away? (She usually has one by her side in her nightstand draw which you can't access because she's right there. She also has stashes of wine that I literally have to search the house up and down to find - behind curtains, behind cushions on the sofa, in the store room, literally anywhere).

Talk her out of it. She always ends up complaining about the same thing and it leads nowhere because ""everything is her fault"".

Ignore her, and tell her that I refuse to communicate with her unless she's sober.

Secretly take the wine away without confronting her?

"Accidental panic attack We have a fun fun thing going on at my house: a rat infestation! It’s an older house, so it was mostly due to old holes and gaps that come with the territory. I had spent most of the day clearing off areas my dad needed to caulk after he finished up in the crawl space. 
I went to join him after finishing everything else up, and put on an extra breathing mask (the kind with multiple straps and filters).

That mask gave me the biggest surprise panic attack I’ve ever had from my 4 years living with PTSD. Breathing in it was so difficult, my brain just automatically thought it was the result of another panic attack and rolled with it. I was gasping for breathe, took me a few minutes to remember it was cuz of the damn mask, not an attack.

"I feel like I'm not a very exciting person. So for the first time in four years, I don't feel like I'm tied down due to my depression anymore. I finally went off my antidepressants three? or so months ago and everything is fine. 

But. I feel like my existential inertia is stronger than ever, and I don't know if it's the ADHD or not. I take Vyvanse (the only medication other than methylphenidate available here) and I only take because I freelance and I'm completely unreliable if I don't. 

Lately, my obsession with reddit/blogs/Netflix has hit an all time high. I'm struggling to meet deadlines and the more they pile on, the more frozen I become. The Vyvanse amps my anxiety to the umpteenth level, and I'm stuck in this cycle of compulsively reading every last thread on a new and interesting subreddit or rewatching a show I've already seen 6x.

It goes something like:

Start of the month: Huge Amount of Work That's Pretty Easy to Do If I Commit to Working Every Day

Day 1: fuck around a little, do the work, then start getting distracted by stuff on the internet

Day 2-6: fuck around

Day 7: Decide to crack down. 

Day 8-20: fuck around

Day 21: Panic sets in. I shut down and become consumed by my procrastination.

Day 22-24: Autism mode. Netflix for 15h a day. I'm not even joking.

Day 25-30: Crack down and start working compulsively, and eventually meet all my deadlines but burn myself out in the process and kick myself for doing this to me and my SO

Meanwhile, I...find comfort in this little world of mine? I pretend nothing's awry and I procrastinate and go down the rabbit hole of the day, and it's seriously the only thing that I feel like doing. 

And it's not depression. I don't feel the bleak brain fog anymore, where everything is dreary. It's just that I don't seem to WANT to do anything else. If anything, this seems to me like an actual addiction. I'm not sure if it's legit or not but I can't NOT throw hours upon hours away doing absolutely fucking nothing. 

What's worse, this rabid content consumption doesn't even satisfy me anymore. I'm restless, but less so than if I weren't doing it. Like how the high for addicts isn't the same after a while, but they still chase it? 

That. 

Is this an ADHD thing? My days are a lot better when I don't take Vyvanse but I don't function nearly as well when it comes to school and work without it.

More importantly, what can I do? I've tried cutting Netflix et al before and I just relapse. Or I find something else to obsess over. Anything but my actual life. Escapism to the detriment of me. ",adhd,adhd

"Social anxieties and emotional meltdowns Last week I was on holiday in Scotland with some American friends, and last Friday I experienced an emotional meltdown as a result of my social anxieties.

The evening before we had not seen the  American friend I talk to most over the internet all night, her husband had said she had crashed out because she was tired but when I was with my parents and brother waiting to go to the bathroom my Mum expressed concern that one of us had upset her. These words ('Have we upset her?') seemed to act as a trigger for me, and I spent the entire night feeling sick, worrying that because I don't understand social conventions I had somehow appeared rude, inconsiderate or ignorant through my actions without my realising.

When I woke up I felt queasy and like I hadn't drunk anything for days. I had a total emotional meltdown related to my social anxieties and my American friend that I talk to the most consoled me outside.

"A few questions from a parent Our 11-year-old high-functioning son goes through periods of difficult behavior (lots of anger/yelling/slamming doors, rudeness, disruption at school, with occasional incidents at home of hitting, biting, and attempts to leave the house).

Once he comes out of these episodes, his behavior is generally very good. He has a therapy session once per week but he does not seem to be applying much of anything from that.

1. Is there a name for these kind of extended periods of such behavior? My understanding is that a ""meltdown"" is not such an extended thing.

"Just switched to Vyvanse after 3 years on adderall. Not sure how I feel about it. I’m in my first semester of nursing school and I’ve been taking Adderall 30mg XR first thing in the AM with 10mg IR around lunch time. That’s been my routine on and off since undergrad. I had to stop taking it at times because my anxiety would get way too out of hand.

At my recent refill appointment, my new PCP asked how everything was working out and I mentioned some of the side effects of adderall I don’t particularly like, like my irritability and moodiness about the time the XR starts to wear off and the general harshness when it wears off. She decided to have me try Vyvanse 30mg for a month instead. 

I’m on day two of the Vyvanse and I’m not sure if the dosage is high enough or if it’s just how it works but I feel like it wears off much faster, like maybe anywhere from 5-7 hours. I do like how much smoother and more gradual the come up and come down is. I almost can’t really tell exactly when it starts to work and when it starts to wear off. Thus far I also don’t seem to be experiencing the moodiness and irritability that I had with the adderall. Only problem is, I really need it to last longer! Being in nursing school and working, my days are long and I need to be able to focus which is already hard enough to begin with. Anybody have an experience with making this switch? Would a higher dosage maybe make a difference? Or should I just ask to go back to adderall since I really need the longevity?

"Drinking alone Hello... this is my first time posting on reddit but here it goes.

I am a teenage girl who everyone sees as having her life together.  I am in no way trying to brag, I am just trying to explain my situation.  I am relatively popular (as popular as you can be at a small school) and I party a lot on the weekends.  I drink and smoke and fuck around.  People mostly think I’m having a good time.

Anyways, I don’t have any close friends (plenty of people I call my best friend but none I really mean) and I think I really need help.  I am very open and loving with my parents but this is something I don’t want to share because I don’t want them to think I’m a disappointment. I also have a therapist who I consistently lie to and conceal things from (probably not helpful but it’s hard for me to open up).  I drink alone ALOT stress on a lot.  

When I’m around people I don’t feel the urge to drink it’s just when I’m alone with my brain and all my thoughts that I feel the urge to drink and it is a really strong urge.  I mean it is 5 pm and I’m drunk, I started drinking once I got home from school.  I just want to escape from my brain and feel different for a while you know?

I have struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts and self harm, anxiety and ADHD and I also think I could possibly (I’m not a psychologist so of course I can’t diagnose) be bipolar.  So I guess these things along with family history could contribute to alcoholism even though I hate to call myself an alcoholic- I guess that is what it is at this point. 

I guess this post is too long, I don’t really know how to do this sort of thing but if anyone has any advice please help me. I am happy to answer any questions I just need help so please talk to me if you have the time...

Thanks and I’m sorry I’m such a mess :(",alcoholism,alcoholism
"Just venting Hello! I just looked up this subreddit because the last year and especially the last months ive been feeling worse. Theres bipolar and psychosis on my mothers side.

Im not diagnosed with anything so i try to refrain from that language because i dont want to be laughed at. 

So i have been feeling bad (sadness and anxiety) since 11 years old, im 26 now. In my family i have always been told that everyone feels bad so i have repressed quiete a bit. I have always felt confused because of this because of my mothers family history and her occupation, and so im sure its me who is just being wrong and a baby. 

Since 2 years or so my partner have been telling me i should see a therapist because i have very fast mood swings. But my point is that if my parents dont think i feel bad why would a stranger do that. I also have fears of going to new places and seeing strangers because they will laugh at me and make me leave or they will talk to me and then tell my parents and talk about me. I live in a small Town so thats not impossible because everyone knows eachother of the older generation. And then my mother will ask me why i didnt tell them i saw a therapist and i cant see him anymore. I think its a him because im more scared of men. 

I wont call to book a time to check my eyesight or take cell samples which i should have three years ago and im afraid i will get ovarian cancer but we dont have that in my family. I think i will get a man so i dont want to go alone either. 

So what im getting to is my anxiety and stress have gotten really amped up this past year and especially the last 6 months. Ive been isolating myself i guess but i didnt realize it until now because i like being alone the most because i get super tired from interaction. But now i havent left my house since last wednesday (a week) and my partner is working in Another Town during the summer. Ive been feeling like my neighbours are staring into my windows from theirs but i cant see them and i dont want to go outside because if they see me they might want to come and ask me something and expect conversation and i dont want that. 

I stay away from self-care but when i told my mother i wasnt showering she asked me if i showered before going to work (not every day of course just to be clean) i said yes because they would be angry and then she just said its fine then. And i tried to be a bit more honest about not feeling too well and that i cant live if i had to work more than i do right now they just say that at least im not as bad off as my maternal grandpa (he was bipolar and killed himself at 42) and that everyone feels bad. 

I guess i feel sad that i feel like im not allowed to feel sad and bad. 

As in its everyday sense i feel, in a cycle: like a god--&gt;sad---&gt;flat---&gt;superior---&gt; repeat. 
Im always feeling ""paranoid"" and thats from i guess what i think other people think and react to me and about me and also interaction and communication wise. 

I think what i wanted with this was: i felt like venting in a place where i felt its okay. Sorry if its not and i made a fool out of myself. Im sorry if i sound weird; english is my second language, im sad and disturbed right now, and i dont want to sound dramatic so you wont take me seriously. 

I think i WANT to see a therapist because i want to say this to someone who is not close to me but i am so afraid about everything i wrote up there. 

My problem is also that i dont have an outlet.
Trying to speak with myself: selfhate and ""paranoia""
Trying to speak with parents: everyone feels bad exactly like you or much worse
Trying to speak with partner; go see therapist (im scared)

Its just too bad and many different feelings that i cant handle. If i think everyone feels like this then everyone must plan to take their own life? And i dont think thats normal?? Or am i embarrassing myself.

"Is it worth seeking a diagnosis as an adult? Hello everyone, 
I’ll attempt to keep this short, but the title is basically the TLDR. 

I’m a 21 year old woman who has been in and out of psychiatric care from therapists to groups to psychiatrists and a couple of hospitalizations. I’ve been diagnosed with depression by multiple doctors as well as GAD and social anxiety, but I always felt like my doctors were missing something, and even my current doctor keeps saying, “I know there’s more to why you’re doing X, Y and Z” but I’ve never had any answers for him. I’m now studying to be a middle school teacher and part of my studies involves learning about children’s disabilities, and after learning about autism, I strongly feel that I am on the spectrum. I was non-verbal my first few years of life and didn’t emotionally respond to things normally, so much so that my parents and relatives jokingly referred to me as “the very serious baby”. I’ve spent my whole life desperately struggling to deal with things that are supposed to be easy. Just existing often feels like too much. In social situations I always felt like a field biologist observing apes—like I wasn’t one of them, and I had to carefully study what they did to be accepted. Every class, every sports team, summer camp, etc, I would show up one day and suddenly everyone had a friend or a group formed. It was like everyone had a meeting in the middle of the night to decide who would be friends with who and I was never invited.  Reading all these symptoms(at least for high-functioning autism)—they all sound like me. From the social problems, to the hypersensitivity, the emotional disregulation: all these symptoms that were never fully addressed by my other diagnoses fit so perfectly, but, being a female, and still being able to generally function, maybe I flew under the radar. 

So, now I’m an adult in college, and I just wanted to hear from other people who were diagnosed as adults and how it happened for you and if you think it’s worth pursuing a diagnoses. I’m not sure if anything can be done at this point, but I feel like it might finally give me some peace that I’m not a broken freak, and give me some direction on how I can handle the problems I still deal with every day (like feeling that being at school is too much to go, not being able to make phone calls and ask for help, not being able to plan or prepare, etc.). Also I’m just scared to actively bring it up.... Anyway, thank you to anyone that can help. ",autism,autism

I'm sure she means well but it's the worst feeling to have food literally shoved down your throat and for the first time I wanted to purge (tried but it didn't work lol what CAN i do right) anyways she recently saw my friend and that day was like oh i thought you were skinny but she's even thinner than you! she's so pretty! and I was thinking she'd get off my ass after that but today morning she force feeds me an omelet with THREE eggs (i said i just wanted one egg and I would get it myself when I was hungry and I wasn't supposed to go over 600 today since I ate so much yesterday) in it telling me how ugly I look like this and that I need to put on weight and go back to how i was a year ago (when at the time she would tell me i look fat randomly when she saw me)and I currently feel ridiculously big and cant even throw up because I don't know how. For reference i'm not even close to underweight i'm 108 and 5'3 (idk if we're allowed to use numbers so let me know and ill delete that) and said friend is taller than me by an inch or two and weighs about the same so idk why she looks ""really good"" and i look malnourished l m a o love asian parents who don't think you're good enough no matter what!! anyways we had a really good relationship before i started having all my food problems or whatever and i don't know if she's being insensitive or this is just standard asian mom roasting and i'm suddenly not able to take it ?? ik this is stupid compared to all of you who have real problems in the depth of the disorder but just thought i'd get something off my chest

"What do I do in a job interview? First post on reddit, so be gentile ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory:**

(Backstory gives a little context but is not entirely important for my problem)

I recently quit my schooling to become a primary teacher. In december I got diagnosed with autism, which in itsself was not a problem to become a teacher for me. all my placements and traineeships in schools were awesome and my mentors told me they thought I would be a really good teacher. The problem was that in the testing we found out that the 4 parts which your IQ consist of did not line up. The rational part of my IQ is on the high side at 123, but my processing speed is very low at 89.  Which runs down to me understanding everything that I hear, but I can not oversee large quantities of information. This is why I had troubles in school. I could not write my master thesis. which is why I quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem:**

Now that I quit school I want to start working. I have a degree as a teachers aid/educational assistant but I am scared that the quitting of my schooling will become a problem during a job interview. I feel that my Autism is in such a mild form that it would not impede on any job duties I would have. But I'm scared that telling them would lover my chances in getting jobs.

"My wife and mother of my nearly 2 year old daughter might have a drinking problem, and I’m struggling. I love my wife and daughter, but I’m starting to question if I can survive staying with my wife. She’s going through a tough time deciding what she wants to do out of college and I fear the stress has turned her to drinking, nearly daily.

 It all started around Christmas. A few days in a row she got very drunk and that resulted in her berating me, at one point hitting and biting me, and throwing things, breaking a few appliances. More than once she has said she will get better, and in a way she has. She hasn’t drank to that point since, but I’m scarred from it. She drinks until she’s goofy and acting funny but it causes my anxiety to go haywire. I’ll start acting distant and irritated with her and when she notices she knows why I’m acting like that. She denies her drinking problem, but it’s gotten to the point that she hides her alcohol throughout the house, denies drinking when I can clearly smell it on her, and has been running errands after drinking. 

I’m worried about my wife, but mostly I’m worried about my daughter. My wife stays home with her 5 days out of the week and I’m afraid of what might happen if she drinks too much around her. I also don’t want my daughter to grow up thinking that this is her mom. 

Last of all, I love my wife and want to help her all I can, but I’m hurting. I find myself thinking about leaving and sharing custody of our daughter but then I go back to worrying about what might happen if I’m not there.

"DAE feel like they're bingeing whenever they eat any snack foods, regardless of the actual calorie content? This is my first post here so I'm sorry if I accidentally broke any rules!

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I've been finding that whenever I eat any type of snack food, I feel immensely guilty and gluttonous afterwards regardless of the actual calorie content and quantity/volume of the snack food I ate. It doesn't matter how carefully measured and portioned my servings are or whether I planned to eat these foods in advance (I typically plan out my full day of eating the night before), I will still feel as if I've binged after consuming snack foods. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find this feeling particularly odd because I am never in a binge state of mind when I eat snacks like this and have probably never experienced a ""real"" binge before as I pre-log all of my calories and am terrified of eating unplanned foods. In theory, I should feel guilt-free about eating foods like this because the snack foods I typically eat are usually prepackaged into single-serving sizes with included nutritional information or I meticulously pre-portion servings myself from larger packages. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm totally baffled by why I feel such immense guilt from eating foods that have never been fear foods for me in the past solely because they can be categorized as ""snack foods.""

"Is there a machine, that can contain a lot of wine, but only pours wine (let's say) 3 times a day on set hours during a day? I have an alcoholic in the family that is not able to walk well anymore.

Only at 18:00 the button works again and the user can go for glass of wine nr 2. Is there something like this? Or is there something like this with a bit of creativity?

"Diagnosed with schizophrenia but think I have health anxiety? I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier this year while hospitalized.

I didn't develop a good relationship with the doctors that diagnosed me and stopped taking the Haloperidol they gave me.

I believe I have health anxiety and my current psychiatrist kind of sort of agrees with me. This second relationship is also very poor. I'm uncomfortable with it and wish I could see someone else but the trauma of all these awful past experiences makes it hard to motivate myself to make the change.

**I believe I have suffered from health anxiety since I was at least 19. That year I thought I had skin cancer (I'm olive to brown skinned and no one in my family has ever had this type of cancer). I wasn't able to sleep for days thinking about it and even feel like I experienced mild hallucinations, that I got bigger, inflated like a balloon in the middle of a sleepless night. I think I even was experiencing panic attacks then, but it's been hard to get a doctor to help me figure out if I did or didn't. Like I said I don't feel listened to in my relationship with my psychiatrist.**

**A funny thing that happens to me when my anxiety gets really bad is that I switch from one disease to another within days or hours and don't realize how unreasonable I'm being. I'll worry I have skin cancer one day, the next it's Lyme disease, the next leukemia. Or sometimes the degree of severity changes, one day I'll forecast one round of chemotherapy (don't know how any of this actually works), the next I'm convinced that it's terminal. Does anyone here experience the same?**

**I usually read tons of info on it online, see a doctor once because I live in a rural area (if I didn't I might have fallen into the habit of multiple visits with different doctors), find and stalk real people who have the disease online, join groups about it, read books, sometimes even prescribe myself ""fixes"", like juicing or dieting, exercise, etc.**

**Another really important aspect is that I seem to develop a lot of rituals or** [compulsions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3LaY8pjD4E) **that help me calm down. Excercise, eating habits, cleanliness related. The more I do them and time passes, because they calm me down, I start to think it's the ""illness"" that's getting better.**

**Since that year I was 19, it really hasn't gone away, it just morphs into a preoccupation with a different illness.** 

By the way everything bolded, which I think is extremely relevant, is stuff I didn't get to tell the unethical megalomaniacs that diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I mentioned the word hypochondria once and was kicked out of the room. Subsequently, I only talked to them about the weather and the food there. They cited they were still able to give me a serious diagnosis taking into account their ""observations"" of me, as if nothing I said mattered and I don't have the ability to have insight into myself and help them, cooperate to find my real diagnosis.

"What to do if parent's childhood report of ADHD is completely biased? I'm soon to take my ADHD assessment, something I've been waiting for a long time now. My psychiatrist sent me a couple forms to fill out, one of which evaluated childhood symptoms from 5-12 that has to be filled out by a parent. 

It took me a lot of courage and several months to tell my mom that I was going to get assessed (I am a college student), and the cost is coming out of pocket for me. She reacted quite negatively and told me that I shouldn't get tested, that I should wait until I start working, etc. I did pretty well in high school, got by with the classic not studying until last minute, yet my grades are slipping more and more in college and knowing now is very important to me.

I sent my mom the form to fill out, and she evaluated me as ""never or rarely"" for every single criterion except talking excessively. There are several things on the form such as prone to daydreaming that I distinctly remember being reprimanded for as a kid, that were noted as nonexistent. I don't know anyone else who would be able to fill out this form for me.

I'm not sure how to proceed here. I have to send the form to my psych before my assessment, and I was going to explain to her the situation and how my mother didn't want me to get tested, but I'm afraid that instead I'll be viewed as another college kid trying to get a prescription. Another person I know, who received a diagnosis, told me to ""doctor"" the form... I live in a college city where lots of people abuse study drugs.

Any advice? I found the most affordable psych to assess me and I would hate to skew my entire assessment. Getting retested again isn't an option for me for the next couple years.

"I wrote this after an interesting night. I have never been the best at expressing how i feel
These thoughts in my head move at the speed of light
If i could just catch one, find the words to make it real
I could make you see that i never want to fight

Trapped in a body that won’t cooperate
I watch in horror as i push you away
If only words could set this straight
But these words will never reach you anyway

I will sit here for hours tweaking and changing
Hoping to find the perfect combination of lines
Even now i want to erase everything
I'm just so tired of lying.

To myself, to others
It doesn't matter
The way i am makes me feel smothered
Sometimes i think im as mad as a hatter

What the fuck is wrong with me?
I try not to blame it all on that shit
Because i'm not blind, i can see
Im a fucking hypocrite

Do i ruin things on purpose, because it is safer to fail?
Or is this how i am but i am too scared to admit it?
These excuses are beginning to feel like a whale,
Because at the end of the day i know i just don't do shit.

Let me try to explain what this ADHD does to me
And hope that these aren't more excuses for my douchebaggery 


I've been told this disorder fucks up my brain
Making rewards that are instant seem like an emergency,
Than those that are longer no matter how plain
I can want, i can need, but to no avail nothing gets done, and i scream internally.

So i take my drugs at an attempt for normalcy
But i just become detached and ravage anything in front of me
It is still hard to focus on what is needed
No matter how many times i've begged and pleaded.

At the end of the day my brain is left empty
The need for completion satisfied, even if nothing got done.
I cease wanting to do anything, and thoughts just don't come.
I could say im a zombie but that isn't quite true, as with anything there is a dichotomy.

That last stanza is terrible but i've stopped caring
My only goal is to help you understand,
To help ME understand
Just what the fuck is wrong with me.

I am never sure what is me and what is the medicine
I believe that blaming my disorder cripples me
But i also know that pretending im normal just makes me depressed
I think i need therapy.

TL;DR I probably need therapy",adhd,adhd

"Seeking diagnosis as an adult (test will be in about month), extremely afraid that I don't fit the narrative (great success at school+uni) and will not get diagnosed. Can you reassure me or do you know a different explanation for my symptoms? Hey folks, I'm looking for some general thoughts on my situation and how I should proceed. I've had some discussions with friends who were diagnosed as kids, as well as with my family, but somehow talking things through with strangers from the internet seems like something that's missing right now, kind of as more impartial parties - so here goes.

I'm almost 30 years old and up until recently it had never occurred to me that I might have ADHD. The main reason being that I was always quite successful and didn't have any problems managing school (well, aside from some mobbing). But in the past three years since I've started my PhD, and especially now after I have a little baby in my life, it's become apparent to me that my attention is an untamed beast - and my lack of being able to properly focus on so many things in my life is starting to take a toll on me, my career, my family and friends. After talking openly about this, multiple people with ADHD told me that I might have it, too. One friend even let me test out some of their meds and holy shit, this stuff works wonders. Which is why I'm seeking diagnosis, and proper legal medication.

But despite all this, let me say that I have my own doubts, too. I don't know if the meds I tried are just working for me because of some sort of Placebo effect. I feel like ADHD explains very many of my quirks and struggles, and at the same time I feel like I don't fit the typical narrative *at all*. For my appointment next month I was asked to bring my school certificates from my first 6 years at school. Since they've told me this, I'm kind of *freaking out* and feeling like I'll never ever ever get a diagnosis: I've had extremely good grades since first grade, and on the certificates my teachers described me as very focused and self-reliant... so maybe I'm totally off with this?! My parents don't think I have ADHD because what they noticed most about me when I was little was how I was able to focus *so extremely well* on a great many things. They also said I was really bad at dealing with boredom and constantly complaining about it, I was always seeking out new interesting things. My mother always thought I should just learn to live with boredom, but my dad has a similar feeling about things and really can't deal with nothing happening for a while and supported me in finding things to do all the time. Of course I'm wondering if they are right and I don't have it - or if perhaps I do have it, and my dad might have it too without even knowing...

I will explain this in detail in the following paragraphs how my mind works and how this has affected my life so far. If at any point you feel like this points to something else than ADHD, I'd be incredibly grateful to hear that. Even if it's just a hunch. ADHD is kind of my best bet right now, but I don't want to obsess over this one possibility if there are others.

As a sort of **premature tl;dr**, I would describe the most prominent of my mind's workings as the following:

 - My mind constantly wants to be active. (To a lesser degree, my body does too; I've had a bit of a restless leg syndrome at times)
 - A lack of ""interesting"" stimuli in a situation or task makes me seek out stimuli elsewhere. I often get very squirrelly/restless when I try to actively work against this impulse to do something else.
 - Conversely, when my mind gets really focused somewhere it's incredibly difficult to pull me out of that; it makes me virtually tune out most of the reality around me. And the worst is that I don't notice this until after the fact: I might not even notice or remember that someone has tried to talk to me.
 - A lack of positive feedback/reinforcement makes me lose attention in a ""non-interesting"" task within minutes; long-term tasks that cannot be broken up into smaller individual parts that I could tick off one by one are very difficult for me.

------------------------

How has this affected my life?

First of all, school interested me. It provided lots of tasks and was an escape from my relative boredom at home, tasks that I often did in a very hyperfocused state. I literally told my parents to back off and no longer try to help me with homework when I was in second grade because their attempts to help me just felt like an annoyance that would break me out of my flow.

When I was 11, I was diagnosed as gifted (high IQ &gt; 130) and this explained many of the social struggles I had been having, I finally understood why my peers were so much slower at nearly every subject at school while it was quite effortless for me: I rarely got frustrated and knew what to do. For more tedious tasks that didn't tickle my mind as particularly interesting, my success waned. This was particularly obvious when learning languages (French, Latin at school and later Japanese on my own accord - huge anime fan back then) because I had trouble bringing myself to sit down and focus on studying vocabulary (or kana).

A similar problem could be seen when I tried learn an instrument and almost never would sit down and train on my own; doing something I wasn't already kind of skilled at didn't actually *frustrate* me, it just made me lose interest incredibly fast when I couldn't see short-term progress. I soon discovered video games and they were the exact opposite: providing a sheer endless amount of small or large challenges with immediate feedback. Eventually I wanted to learn how to make video games on my own, and taught myself C and C++ in third grade (Yes, I was 8 years old and understood pointers. You might see why I eventually studied computer science.) Despite my understanding, none of my video game projects were ever finished because sitting down and getting through the boring parts just felt impossible. I lacked perseverance and determination for things that didn't provide positive affirmations after at most a few hours of trying.

I ended up studying computer science and finishing literally as the best student in my year. It was hard though, because there were so many times when a lecture was going too slow for me and not providing enough input, which made me trail off on my phone or my laptop, and then I'd have missed the next step and find it hard to follow. The more complex subjects were the best suited for me because they didn't let me become bored and trail off - I deliberately picked the harder stuff. I was also a bit of a perfectionist and while (like my peers) I got incredibly stressed out from each subject requiring weekly hand-ins of homework that was graded and required to write the exam, working in these small iterations and feedback loops were really a kind of learning I could get behind. I can focus well when the deadline for a hand-in is tomorrow because the pressure keeps me on it.

My success would still have been impossible if I didn't have a learning partner for most of my studies who constantly *nagged* me whenever my mind was trailing off. We would literally be studying a lecture together, or working on a mathematical problem, and suddenly there'd be Reddit on my computer screen and she would scold me and push me back to work. Which was hard and made me feel on edge, but it *did* work. Alone, I don't even notice when I procrastinate for an hour. My perception of time is weird. I'm very focused on the moment, on the ""now"" and whatever my focus is at that moment.

It shouldn't come as a surprise that writing my bachelor and master thesis was an ordeal of a degree I had never experienced before. For most of the time I wasn't able to get any results simply because week after week would pass in which I constantly procrastinated and didn't get results. I had a very strong imposter feeling back then, and it was only due to good advisors and my ability to *eventually* start working with incredible efficiency and focus whenever a deadline draws near, that I managed to do these and even do them well. That is the thing. I do have lots of energy. I am highly capable and intelligent. But unless some external pressure pushes me to keep at it, I won't be able to do things.

In hindsight, deciding to do my PhD in theoretical computer science was not such a good idea - but it's when I seriously started noticing that things were not alright and going downhill. After just a few months, I couldn't really bring myself to work and get results anymore. I just... always trailed off into other directions. You see, the work I'm doing is very mathemetical and often doesn't have clear strategies that one can follow. You pretty much look at a problem, try to read papers in the general area, try to get ideas on how to solve things. You might have a hunch that something can be proven, try for a few months without success... then get the feeling that instead your hypothesis must be false, and try to prove *that* for a few months. And maybe you get nothing in the end and... yeah, eventually a year had passed and I hadn't really managed a single proof.

Now I'm *three* years into my PhD and have managed to co-author a single paper, and I only managed that because it was half-based on what I had already done in my master thesis and the most complex parts of the paper were done by my co-authors (of course, this might be my imposter syndrome talking). My prof is a very friendly type who doesn't nag me about getting results that much; and I've become pretty good at explaining away why I didn't make any progress. The reality is that I couldn't even spend 8 hours a day in my office but sometimes just 6, sometimes as low as 4, and perhaps twice a week I manage to even *try* to start some research... and just trail off after less than an hour upon hitting a spot where I don't progress. I literally fall asleep when trying to read most papers, even when I slept enough the night before and have no reason to be tired. Things just completely don't work. That said, I've always explained this away as me just having incredibly bad work ethics. I've tried multiple things like e.g. the Pomdoro technique to keep working, but fail again and again.

------------------------

Since I've had this baby (I'm taking a year off work for it), I have noticed that this kind of behavior is NOT just apparent at work, but in fact present in many different areas of my life - and it seems to limit me *everywhere*. Now, of course I find my baby lovely and interesting and often it can be my absolute strongest point of attention. But here's the thing about having a baby: you spend a LOT of idle time with it. It doesn't challenge the mind much. When it provides feedback (and since it's ~3 months old, it does!), things are lovely. But when it just has to cry for a while with no apparent cause that I could alleviate, my mind wanders elsewhere. I found myself completely spacing out despite having my crying baby on my shoulder, a baby that I absolutely *do* want to show my attention in such moments! But instead I kinda tuned it out, proceeded to check my phone and answer texts, whatever. I find it hard to describe it without coming off as normal; let's just say my co-parent was not pleased at all about my behaviour, witnessed this tuning out on multiple occasions, and it really doesn't feel good to me either. But I don't even notice until I'm called out for it.

I'm noticing things in my relationships and friendships as well. It was always very hard to chat with me because the moment I write a message, my mind goes to a different place on my computer and I completely forget to check back, sometimes I notice after an hour ""oh right, I started chatting with this person to ask them something and they've been waiting ever since"". Talking with me in person gets difficult because I can't very well deal with pauses in the conversation. Others say that after I've made my point, I will keep repeating it and explaining it in other ways until I get some sort of response. When I ask a question and the other person doesn't answer but takes time to think, I get impatient and feel shitty and my mind keeps racing and making up scenarios on what they could be thinking (tend to be one of those folks who often get anxious due to worst case scenarios that they made up in their head). When I try to Skype with someone, sitting in front of all these others possibilities on my computer screen will eventually make me trail off and multitask, not really listen to what the other party says.

I am often asked the question ""Did you listen to what I just said?"" and in the past, I've tried to act like I did a *lot* even when I didn't understand a single thing for the past minutes. It was like a compulsion, like definitely not wanting others to find out that I don't pay attention to them. Because I want to be a person who *does* pay attention to their friends and partners, and I think I often *can* be that (especially in the honeymoon phase of a new relationship) - but quite often, I just don't. I spaced out again and focused on something else. Since I'm considering whether I have ADHD, I've allowed myself to be more honest, at least with people who know that I might have it. It's like ""yeah, I absolutely *do* act like this, I have been for *years* and I know it's shitty, but maybe I am now finally figuring out why I do that"".

People close to me have described other behavior that I also do link to ADHD. After an extremely unproductive day, I sometimes get into an extremely productive phase, especially late at night when I should actually be sleeping. Or I see something that I untidy around the house, and then proceed to clean that up, and while doing so I noticed something else and suddenly I'm doing things left and right and in the end feel very *happy* about managing so much at the same time. Honestly, those phases of extreme multitasking feel amazing, as if I had some sort of superpower! At the same time, that only works for relatively small, quick tasks and the downside is that a longer task will inevitably be hindered by lots of these little distractions...

This is getting too long. There's other things that I would want to talk about, e.g. that I'm polyamorous and I see a connection to ADHD in how I've treated relationships. Also that I'm trans and really afraid that it will prevent a positive diagnosis somehow. And also how I find it so difficult that people try to find out if you had ADHD as a kid already; I had a late realization about being trans, too, and I would never have been diagnosed there if they had asked if I felt this way as a small kid already, so it feels so *threatening* and *wrong* that for ADHD this is apparently needed...

But I'm pressing ""send"" now before I try to perfect this text any more, I've already lost way too much time on that... :/ So there's probably more things but well, can't put *everything* in here can I? Yeah. Just ask if you want.

If you have made it this far, thank you for your time and attention. Any input is deeply appreciated. ",adhd,adhd
"Why I don't talk about what happened. Most people can go through their day to day life not having to consider the possibility they could be a victim of a crime. It is something that they just see on TV but I don't have that luxury. I don't go out at night. I have to constantly be aware of what is going on around me and its exhausting.

Its even more exhausting listening to people try to one up me with their own stories after they ask me why I walk with a limp. Its more exhausting to listen to how they would have done some move they saw in John Wick. Its more exhausting listening to how I don't have PTSD because I was not in the military.

Muggers really pick up on the limp. I've been targeted a couple times since. People like to give me advice and theorize what I am doing wrong. I pretty much just get everything delivered to my apartment now so I don't have to go out.

I'm afraid to go to Dr. because I'd have to take time off from work and they require a note. They would see it was from a therapist and they would probably find a reason to let me go. They've let other people go and they can always find a reason. Someone told me management at my last job thought I was a liability because I might ""go postal"" and were happy that I left on my own accord.

My eye twitches now and I stammer when I'm stressed. People think that is funny. I started having sleep paralysis which can apparently also be caused by stress. Shadow people and auditory hallucinations of someone asking for help while I am completely frozen are really funny.

"Trying to help someone in a really weird situation, would love it if the members of this community could help. Hi /r/autism,   
Two years ago, I met this autistic adult online (whose username I will not give here) through Discord, and he struggles a LOT with social skills. He's a really nice guy who always means well, invariably (as shown by the theme of the online content he tries to make), but he is also invariably the target of online bullying, due to his frankly very poor communication skills, and his consequent inability to defend himself.   
I'm at a point where I feel like I really, really want to find some way to get social intervention so that he can be helped, because from what I've deduced he really struggles IRL too, and it's just such a shame that someone as clever as he is isn't even being given a chance to develop his social skills because the only way he feels he can communicate effectively, the Internet, is filled to the brim with people who want to do nothing but attack him and wear him clean of any kind of social proficiency. IRL, it seems like he can't find anyone to help him learn social skills - either that or people in his local area just aren't patient enough to deal with him and help him be the person he deserves to be.

"complex PTSD is a real freaking blast and a half! ☺️ So I was recently told that I have complex-ptsd, which makes senses. And given the things that have happened to me, I know I am not weak, but strong for have developing a survivalist mentality. But I can’t turn it off. And I lose large chunks of time. So for example, most of high school is blank. Almost like a giant blackout. But even though this blackout drips into my elementary school days, I still remember how these things made me FEEL, and most of the time I feel nothing because of it. 

So sounds very COMPLEX.

I’ve been in and out of homes - maybe around six or seven in my short life of 20 years. When I was a four month old baby my mother threw a tantrum and stabbed up the couch I was laying on, almost killing me. Then I never knew stability, and the promise of family and “forever homes” were an automatic shutdown for me. I started to experience trauma, anxiety, and depression symptoms at a young age - like around three - and those would include terrifying nightmares, shutting myself in my bedroom alone, and terrific bursts of rage, during which I would smash my small body against things. 

I haven’t really known peace inwardly, but outwardly was even worse. To survive most of the things I had gone through from birth, I developed a cold, cruel personality in which I would test to see if people would give up on me. I was obsessed with moving and knew the signs of a parent giving up by the time I was five. I was a smart kid. Still am. But because of my anger and hostility I was quickly nearly expelled in grade one and put in a behavioural class. I also was frequently restrained improperly - being only around 75 - 80 pounds, two large adults would sit atop my body while I thrashed and screamed. I was also isolated - literally, a technique to manage my behaviour in the group home was to keep me hidden and prevent me from socializing. Even on my birthday! 

Time was lost - all I knew was books and escaping into my writing of novels. But as punishment sometimes my writing bag full of books would be taken away! 

I had no escape then, and I would often daydream about my novels at school and couldn’t wait till I got home to get started on them. I’ve been writing books since I was six years old, actually. 

Things are VERY blurry. Tons of screaming, yelling, stuff being packed into boxes, being hit, being bullied, being molested, being shamed for being molested, being belittled and humiliated by adults in my life, being abandoned nonstop, and being powerless and angry and depressed and terrified and ALONE. 

So, as you can imagine, complex ptsd is not really all that big a surprise to me. I haven’t been able to sleep properly my entire life, was on meds at age five onwards, and only stopped having  terrifying nightmares when I was fourteen. 

But a day in the life of complex ptsd is actually ironically complex. I am usually quite bubbly and I get energetic and loud when I’m excited. I love socializing. I smile and laugh and joke and bring light to others. I even have a soul that is a magnet for babies, kids, and animals, and often find myself flustered when they are drawn to me because I don’t understand why. 

But deep down I am still that neglected, terrified child who was treated like a monster by actual monsters. And I revert to that after a long day of being the class clown archetype - which is something I invented to protect myself from a young age, so people wouldn’t see how messed up my home life was. When I want to go home and shut myself in my room, I will, and the need becomes fierce. People deeply drain me and I am constantly scanning their expressions and body language and always on high alert and I see and hear everything and oh my God even listening to music at high volume doesn’t help and for longer than I can remember for reasons I can’t remember, I’ve been afraid of people sneaking up behind me. A fear that I’ve had since I was small but I don’t know why and that frustrates me. Losing track of time can be frustrating, and so can these mile-long blackouts where I can’t remember WHY I am like this. You might say it’s better to not remember but it’s frustrating. Also, if I can’t even remember how many days ago I went to the mall, or even feel like anything more than a shallow zombie floating to and from bus stops, it’s getting bad. 

And I know I have an incredible team of friends who have become family and a PHENOMENAL trauma counsellor who will not give up on me. But I need to learn to deal with myself and be kind to myself. As a survivor of narcissistic abuse on top of all that, I am worried I’m gonna get me in the end. And there’s nothing I fear more than myself. With my ability to influence a crowd of people or turn a room into chaos with my knowledge of basic psychology - not textbook shit lol just experience stuff - I’m most afraid of myself.

do people with autism have a hard time telling lies from the truth? I feel like i was cheated on, and i was told very openly about some points that sound suspicious but sound innocent if it was the actual truth if that makes sense? 

like my thought process is I get the feeling it's a lie,but for some reason I believe that lie? I'm kinda gullible like someone will be messing with me thinking I get that they are messing around when i actually believe it as complete truth a couple of weeks will pass and then I'll realise it was them just messing around...why did i take it seriously?

[Massachusetts] My nephew's mom just found out he is on the spectrum. He is 3yrs 8mos. I was an ABA therapist for around 5 years but have since moved out of state.  My nephew's mom has little resources and is in a pretty bad space right now.  I am trying to assist her from afar.  She is frustrated with the daycare provider who doesn't know how to deal with my nephew and often makes her come pick him up early or make him sit in the office for hours.  He is aggressive towards other children (pushing) and engages in self harm such as hair pulling and biting his own arm.  She will be trying to get him into public preschool next year and thus receive an IEP and school based services.  Most of the autism day providers in her area have a 6 month wait list.

"21, good life but still drinking hi everyone, im young and my life is good, i think.  
but i drink, preferably 3 times a week. Since a year ago, i have started to think that my drinking habits is very different from that of my friends. And just now i have realised that im addicted. I am drunk for the 4th day in a row while writing this. Scrolling this sub makes me believe that maybe im not that bad, but then again, why am i drinking so much more than my peers. I want to stop, but i dont want to stop. I am not depressed, i have had a good upbringing, and have a good life, which makes it hard for me to find a reason for why i am drinking so much.   


it is embrassing for me to drink, because my life isnt bad, does anyone else feel like this. Reading the stories of people on this sub, it makes ""sense"" why they drink. But why the fuck do i do i then?

"Massive Blackout Haunting Me I am just going to throw it out there that I am not new to drinking. The only times I have ever blacked out for an entire night was when I was under the influence of alcohol AND drugs. Other than that it's just been ""brown"" outs or fuzziness here and there on occasion. 

The other night I blacked out HARD. There are a few things that I remember that are extremely, extremely vague. I only had four drinks and I was not on an empty stomach. The drinks were decently strong I will admit, but as I said this was not my first rodeo. I went from being kind of tipsy to completely obliterated and blacked out after one more drink. There was never a second where I felt like I was too drunk, and usually I start to feel sick before things even get fuzzy these days. I lost probably about 4 to 5 hours. No idea how I got home. Then there was a moment where it felt like I literally snapped out of it.

Does this sound normal for a blackout? I am asking because I am entertaining the idea that someone may have slipped something in my drink. I have been drugged before and it was a similar feeling, but I don't remember leaving my drink anywhere this time. Maybe I'm just getting old and can't handle alcohol the way I used to?!

"A poem about my experience. Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

"Catastrophic binge ft. 10 lbs of weight gain I made a comment in the daily thread but it was super long and I felt kind of extra posting it, lol. I feel like I use this sub as a diary sometimes. I just feel like inhuman trash because I just finished a 3 day binge that made me gain about 10 lbs in water and food weight and most likely some real weight too. Guess who is therefore now doing an extended """"""fast""""""  🙃 and I'm visiting family so I'll have to be convincing them I'm eating. Idk what is going to happen to me when the semester starts; I'm going to be stressed out 24/7 and probably binge urges are going to be 1000x as strong. I keep telling myself maybe I can eat over maintenance and try to find a good gym program that will turn the food into actual muscle. I've never really known what I was doing in the gym though and I sure can't afford any type of personal trainer. I need to do some research if I want a shot at any kind of semi stable food and exercise regimen (after 6 years of this shit who knows but I have to keep hoping).

I only drink to relieve my anxiety, to make me feel better, and sometimes to get to sleep or to make me feel better before going to college (UK, not US). I can't go to parties without knowing there's a ready supply.

"Medication Effects and Hyperfocus - Wondering Whether Others Can Relate I'm not on an exactly low dose for adhd. in fact, it consists of two different medications (IR) at upper dosages. 

It feels like l-amp (Vyvanse) controls my mood and impulses in the morning along with improved focus - else I'm all over the place, my mind remains a nonabsorbent sponge which I can't remember or learn at all and have issues even taking care of myself. Hell, it's a chore to brush my teeth daily, and d-amp (Adderall or Dexedrine) makes me focused and controls irritation, frustration and impulsivity and ""giveupness"". I feel like medications for me improve uncontrollable emotions most, focus coming in at second, and then motivation. Another good part is during class instead of thinkin about women or other distracting things, it numbs that part and can take notes and absorb *some* of the things talked about in class.

Tho, sometimes I notice that sometimes it feels like I've gone like autistic on a task - no offense or ablism intended, and may become too detailed in completing a task - it has to be done completely properly and satisfactory to its standards. Normally unmedicated, I prob wouldn't even start the said task to begin with as I just *hate* the thought of ""there's TOO MUCH of it"" or ""this is gonna take a long time"". Other problems are sleeping and sleep cycle. I work terrible shifts - well until I can finish internship applications which I'm still putting off.

"Tis the Season &amp; Now Fireworks Are Coming TW: discussion of fireworks and dissociation.   


\-----\*-------  
For the past 7 years I have done my best to avoid fireworks as they are a trigger for my PTSD. I'm not a vet; I just happened to be an unlucky traveler who got caught near a mortar shell bombardment. I moved to a new place in what seemed to be a quiet neighborhood just before the 4th of July. Two days leading up to it there were some fireworks going off a few blocks away. They were unpleasant, but I went through my exercises to maintain my calm. As fireworks are illegal in our area, I called the local police's firework specific line who told me there was nothing they could do. *(side rant: then what's the point of this specific number?!)*

On the night of the 4th, I learned that two of my neighbors one to the SE and the other to the SW had managed to get a hand on *(semi?)* professional grade firework. Which they set off in the middle of the street. For hours. I'm talking starting at about 8/9pm and going until maybe 3am. At some point a cartridge or something landed on my roof.  I completely shut down and lost myself to dissociation. I could not walk. I could not talk. I could not move. I could only scream. It felt like I was screaming forever. That I would die screaming. My SO told me I sustained a constant sound for about 5+ minutes straight before going ""eerily silent, but still screaming.""  

I'm not sure how long it took me to snap back to reality. That hazy feeling that something still isn't quite right stuck with me for days. This is the first time in years, I had it this bad. Now it's another holiday season with the promise of fireworks, and I have no idea how I'm going to survive this one.

"I hear a voice that criticizes me and yesterday it got hellish. Help me please. I am here looking for guidance and help because I am scared of my own mind.  I feel like Dr. Google is not the best thing for me, but at be same time I’m not really in a place to get a proper diagnosis as of yet, though I’m trying to get one ASAP. 

I have symptoms that I believe relate to schizophrenia and I feel like you guys are the next best thing to help me identify what’s going on. 

I’m 20 years old right now. And after years of taking acid and smoking, I think my childhood trauma (which I haven’t really thought about until now) is catching up with me. In brief, I’ll describe my experiences that lead me to think that, if not schizophrenia, there’s something definitely wrong:

I’ve recently developed a voice in my head which is not my own. It’s becoming more and more critical of my life by the week. At first it was more of a neutral “You are doing this, and this is how you feel” type of thing. It started to alarm me when it would describe to me what I’m feeling without my actual thoughts displaying that outwardly. It was like some sort of “Truth filter” that I couldn’t really control. At first I thought it was me. But as time went on, it became way more menacing and a lot more honest than I would have liked. And when I tried to tell it to stop, that’s when I realized that it was something other than me. 

It tells me things like “I could shut your whole body down right now if I wanted to” and in my mind I try to beg it not to. And once I beg, it laughs at me. I would say ridicule, but it’s too true for me to deny anything it says. 

Usually right before this voice flairs up, I can feel a pressure in my head, almost like a small bubble it feels like going through my brain. 

I used to smoke weed a lot. But now it only makes things a lot scarier so I’ve stopped. 

I’ve also noticed that I seem to be receiving messages from random media like tv or music. I’ve had to condition myself to not make connections that I know aren’t there. It sucks because I’ve always had a knack for seeing patterns and connecting dots that others around me are like “woah I’ve never seen it like that” but now my mind picks up on phrases and keywords that I start to believe relate to my life and my situation and coincidences that are a little too real. Like God is telling me something. I haven’t been religious in my life, but the universe is definitely sending me messages. And I try so damn hard not to see reason behind them. 

My family has a history of mental illness. My grandmother has PPD and anxiety and my mother has Depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. 

I want soo sooooo bad to be a normal person. I really really don’t want this to be my formal diagnosis. But I can feel when I’m breaking from reality. It usually feels like I feel the effects of an acid trip out of nowhere and then I get startled and have to breath deep breaths to calm myself. And that’s when the voice starts criticizing my life. 

Please, someone tell me if I need to get this checked out. I mean I will, but coming from a black family, mental illness is seen as weakness. But it’s obviously torn my family apart in ways only the voice lets me see.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Finally Quit :) Unfortunately to late. I just figured id write this because maybe this will help someone.

So I've drank since I was probably 15 pretty steady. Then when I was a little older I started drinking with my stepfather. Drinking vodka and rum and shots and always beer. Love my beers. But he was abusive to my mother and I ended moving back to Florida.

Long story short, I quit drinking the hard stuff because I became a totally different person when I would drink it. An asshole I think they call it lol

Anyways throughout my life I was always the guy with a beer in his hand but you'd never really see me drunk. It would take a lot to get me there. Usually work days id have about 9 beers a night at least, then eat right before bed so id end up with heartburn or would even throw up. Then on the weekends I could easily drink 20 beers a day. Especially if went fishing and kayaking.  Usually barely eating anything for those days.

So fast forward and I'm 50 now. I can tell things are definitely not right in my belly. So I actually stop drinking. After I think 4 days I find it hard to go to the bathroom. And then, I simply cant. Turns out I guess beer is kinda a natural laxative so it was enabling the stool to pass the what I come to find out is a tumor.

So I haven't gone to the bathroom in days. Make the appointment to have to have a colonoscopy its 5 days away counting the weekend! so it was like 9-10 days total.

 At this point I'm barely eating. I mean, you cant have trains pull into the station without any departures. Monday is prep day where you have to start drinking 64  fluid ounces of Gatorade with miralax amongst other things. They say be prepared to spend the day on the toilet...nothing. And now I've drunk 64 ounces of this drink and just ready to burst so I give up and go to the hospital.

After my first C-scan the doctor comes in really doesn't say much and leaves. Now I get a male nurse and he starts talking a bit about cancer, and there not sure, and more tests. Then he gets an emergency and runs out. So I'm just laying there another guy comes in and says I'm being admitted and there sending me upstairs. He says has anyone told you what's going on and I said, not really...so he says...I just wanna say good luck to you bro. And the way he said it I instantly understood how bad it was. They all had seen the C-scan and new it was cancer that had spread which makes it stage 4.

Still with me? 

So that night I end up having surgery. They give me a colostomy bag so I can go to the bathroom. It was decided to do chemo first and do minimal surgery, so I could recover quicker.

Nothing like waking up to having a colostomy bag. Its just horrible. Horrible.

I think I haven't really freaked about this because that cancer is in a good spot so when they do surgery again they can just cut out the tumor and reconnect the colon and get rid of the bag altogether. So hopefully temporary.

Day after surgery two interns I guess, are showing me how to change the bag. They seem to be learning themselves and I'm just humiliated this is all happening, and then all of a sudden I swear it feels like a 150 degrees. I say I think I'm having a stroke. And it is just so hot and I'm begging for them to get me ice and let me have water. I'm begging. So she comes back with 3 big ice packs and I put them behind my neck and on my chest and its still so hot. And they cant give you a drink in case you have to have emergency surgery so its just torture. So the doctors comes in and throws the bag on. I couldn't see at this point, I honestly don't know if its all because all my levels and numbers where plunging or because I basically would keep a towel over my head and try to sleep through it all.  And I was also on morphine lol

My hands and feet feel so weird. I remember thinking I don't even know if I can think of a word to describe this feeling, and I cant. I remember thinking if there was a switch to shut myself off...id switch it. Just the absolute worse feeling ever. And the intern is screaming, he's turning gray! The buzzers are going off and there people everywhere sticking needles and different things in me, and then I wake up in the ICU

Was never told what happen. I think it was sepsis  Lost over 20lbs. I would say all muscle. Had no idea how quickly you can go to shit,,,

Not sure how many days I stayed in ICU I think 4-5 days.  

Cant say enough about nurses. I kept telling them how important they are. I really was impressed!

So now home maybe four days and it was my first day of chemo today. I now have to wear the colostomy bag and a pump that pumps through a tube into a port that delivers the chemo straight into an artery. Makes sleeping fun! Luckily you wear it for 3 days then they take it off and you have like 2 weeks between before they put it on again.

So far the only side effect I'm feeling I've never heard of before. Extreme sensitivity to cold. As I type this I have Pepsi with ice in it. When you take a sip it burns your lips and feels very rough in the back of the throat. Like drinking fine glass shards. She said it will get so bad you will put on an oven mitt to get something outta the freezer.  If you hold the Pepsi with ice it feels like that hand has been working out in winter weather without gloves and it just aches. How crazy!

So I have 9 spots of cancer on my liver. The big spot (the tumor in the colon) and cancer in the omentum. 

Never heard of that organ before, but this one worries my cancer doctor the most it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

So looking at 6 months chemo and surgery during or after the chemo. I think 2 outta 3 beat this.

Surprisingly pretty calm about it. Already talked to the kids about it a bit. I look at it like, there are little kids that have to go through this. At least I got to 50

And im 90% percent sure this was caused by my drinking and poor diet so...

I was discharged on October 2nd and soon after decided to take myself off of the meds, maybe a week later. It has now been 2 weeks since I stopped taking the antipsychotic and maybe a week ago I noticed the inaudible whisper thing happening again, but it day by day got more intense and would happen more frequently. Today I had a meeting with the psychiatrist and told him I had gone off the meds, I told him that I was feeling more depressed and I told him about the whispers. He told me to go back on the meds. 

I don’t really know what I’m asking, but I guess I just want to know what is wrong. I’m 16 years old and have just got out of a wheelchair after being in it for 3 months.

"relationship break due to alcohol My partner and I are currently taking a relationship break.

The fact that she drinks that much 7 days a week without fail...every night, just seems like a lot to me.

Would it be over bearing if I were to ask her to get a liver panel to see if she's already done damage?

Today she called him and we quickly left to go get him from his new appt in a new town where he was working a relatively new job. 

We found him at the end of a road near his appt (in a rural community) passed out drunk in his car. 

The drive back to my mothers (about an hour) was the longest of my life and very disturbing.  He was out of his mind and speaking complete nonsense, most of it paranoid thoughts about the government and the people who had wronged him throughout his life. Eventually he admitted to multiple personalities, and they continued to fly about the conversation. 

When we got home he stomped about for hours cycling through all of his paranoid thoughts (he’s been drunk for about a week and lost his job) until we gave him a sleeping pill and he finally went to bed.  What my mom and I witnessed tonight was more than I’ve ever seen in movies, and could be compared to the exorcism. It was really fucked up and I feel bad for my mom for having to witness it. It was deeply disturbing and we are very scared for his well-being.

He has been on sertraline and represidone at various times...(I’m very sorry I don’t know the correct spellings) and said tonight he’d love to go back on represidone. BUT he always comes off his meds and resorts to weed or cbd oil which he claims does wonders for him.

I was lying in bed with my computer, mind going a million miles an hour like usual, fidgeting like I do, and generally not being able to focus on much... But suddenly, as I was sitting there, everything sort of... Stopped for a few minutes.

It's important to note that I always have music playing in my head and always have for as long as I can remember. I can't turn it off, and it can switch at random to something else.

Some part of me really thought recovery would be easy. In part, it was because my family and friends expected change to be rapid, constant, upward, and successful.

It being lighting a cig, smoking a blunt, etc. Every single time I would smoke, I would get smoke in my eyes that would further fuck up the look of my eyelashes.

"I need to have a rage My husband has autism and has recently went for a PIP assessment (Basically a benefit from the government relating to disabilities). He has received this benefit for 3 years already for depression, anxiety and autism. 

His claim has been denied as they feel he doesn't require any assistance. Some of their reasons why are as follows:

• At the assessment he appeared to look well and dressed smart.

- we advised them prior to the assessment that I am the one who picks clothes for my husband to wear on a daily basis. I can't believe they have said no because I didn't allow him to look scruffy?

• At the assessment he showed no signs of low mood or anxiety

- Depression is not a 24/7 thing. Someone is allowed to have a good day and still be depressed. When we showed up for the appointment we were told that there was a 1 hour delay. He tried to wait in the reception but became so anxious that we had to go and wait.in the car.

• That he has a driving licence 

- Just because someone can drive doesn't mean that they do! My husband passed his test many years ago before his mental health became unmanageable. I took time off work and rescheduled the assessment in order for.me to drive him to the appointment and attend with him for support.

• That his depression medication is currently working and he is not currently seeking other treatment. 

- his tablets are work g currently but he continually meets with his doctor to keep a check on the medication, his extreme depression stems from being autistic and feel I g so different. They reason he isn't pursuing other  treatment is because autism is not something that can be cured.

• That he was friendly with the lady that conducted the assesment.

- he's not a fucking monster?

• He gained qualifications while at school without any help.

- he gained 1 qualification while at school which was barely a pass. He was kicked out of every school he attended for behavioural problems, however his autism was undiagnosed at the time. The lady at the assessment never asked for any of that follow up information.

I'm furious that under the write up of the decision, he states that ""he has decided that he has more good days than bad days"" from the 20 minute window that he was seen in.  Some jumped up cunt  who has never met my husband has made this decision on the most ridiculous of reasons. 

Rant over. We're appealing the decision.

"Mom keeps getting herself into debt, what do I do? We have paid off her debts plenty of times before, but she's never stopped borrowing money and she never tells us the complete truth. So months/years later, we find out there was more debt that wasn't paid and racked up in 10% interest per month the whole time. We have no clue where she spends her money, she won't tell us anything. She's suspicious of everything and probably doesn't want us to know how much trouble she got us all into. My siblings and I are so exhausted, she left us a couple of days ago with no money for food or anything else. We have no money. She also stole $2,000 and only told us when she left. We don't know what's going on and I feel so hopeless. I have my own mental health issues and it's taking a massive toll on me.

Can someone please give advice on how I can help my mom? We're so lost. We've thought about taking her to her psychiatrist but she's incredibly suspicious and would probably cause a massive scene and make her distrust us even more.

"Quick Tip: NEVER select ""Remember Info"" for online payment Controlling impulses is something that a lot of us with ADHD have trouble with. Nowadays, with Amazon, PayPal, Apple Pay etc. everything is available at your finger tips so it's even harder to control your spending. I find entering in your password and card information for every purchase gives your brain an external motivator to reconsider your purchase. It's still possible that your impulses may get the better of you, but at least you have a better chance at rethinking your purchase.

"Calling a dietician this week I was recommended by a counselor to see a dietician. I was doing okay with recovery on my own for a few months until my brain spiraled out of control again and suddenly I was doing even worse than before. I wasn’t even counting calories or weighing my food I just couldn’t force myself to get more than a couple sips of soup and some almond milk without panicking. Except for when I’d get drunk and binge on oyster crackers. I didn’t share all that with the counselor though (only comfortable with you people here, thank you all for being so supportive and understanding). I mainly discussed the currently out of control anxiety and depression and she asked about eating habits, so I mentioned that I was feeling stressed and some restrictive eating habits from my past were resurfacing. She asked if I ever purge and I was honest that I had occasionally before but not recently. She explained how the restriction and the mental health issues perpetuate each other when your brain isn’t fully functional from malnourishment and I knew that but just couldn’t admit it to myself. I didn’t expect the referral but I’m glad she gave me it because I really am tired of this cycle and not being able to enjoy life because I’m constantly distracted by my thoughts and self hatred, in addition to just not functioning as an adult being my energy levels and brain function are screwed. I’m absolutely terrified and have no idea what this will be like but I know I need to make some kind of real commitment to recovery with accountability beyond just me and myself because my inner voice is trash obviously.

"A letter I wrote in response to the NYTimes ADHD Article. Re: In Praise of A.D.H.D., (Gray Matter, March 17, 2018)
When I read the piece by Mr. Mlodinow, I felt obliged to explain my perspective on ADHD as a person who has lived under its grasp for all 18 years of my life. It’s something that’s been a constant force in each interaction I, and many of my friends have had with the world. I’ve heard a plethora of external opinions on ADHD, and I feel that there is a vast expanse of misunderstandings that warrant addressing. Of these misconceptions, Mr. Mlodinow’s piece contains one of the most common, and most understandable – the idea that ADHD is a boon, a super power ready to be harnessed. It is anything but.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s easy to interpret “hyperactive” as some superhuman ability to process everything that might be thrown at a person, but that is far from the case. I am not some supercomputer adroitly computing hundreds of points at once, I am your average desktop computer with dreams of greatness attempting to do the job of the aforementioned supercomputer. If you’ve ever tried to use a computer with hundreds of tabs open, you should get a general idea what the result of this process is.

&amp;nbsp;

My medication does not, as the article suggests, slow me down. It is the sole thing that can allow me to close the useless tabs and devote myself to what is important. It is what allows me to do my work without hiding my phone in the other room lest I become completely derailed from the essay I have due tomorrow by a text tone. Without it, work is a battle. With it, work can become something close to accessible.
 
&amp;nbsp;


It isn’t entirely incorrect to say that ADHD has its benefits, especially when considering creative ability. I do often feel that my ability to make ‘odd and unlikely associations’ can give me an edge in whatever topic I am focused on at the moment. At times, I can hyper focus on a task completely and channel all my mental power into a single activity, working uninterrupted for hours without realizing how much time has passed. But those moments of intense productivity are few and far between, and if given the option, I would instantly trade them away for the opportunity to simply sit myself down and work without the sense that I had to mentally beat myself into submission just to read a twenty-page section of my textbook.
 
&amp;nbsp;


To those of you with children with ADHD, I absolutely encourage you to promote their creativity and to acknowledge the mental power they have at their disposal. But do not shirk from an opportunity for medication or treatment. It is not about slowing their brain down, it’s about allowing them a brief window of neurotypical life, a chance to live without each moment being a struggle for the simple success of accomplishing some basic task.

"My doctor prescribed 27 mg Concerta and 20 mg Dexedrine Spansule As far as I'm concerned, the Concerta by itself is great.

She said she was going to prescribe 20 mg Dexerdrine Spansule to take around this time, as needed.

It's not even noon and i feel like shit...anyway i hope we can stop this sh1t.

So going from one day of praising the media coverage of EDs ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xbHnQj60yQ&amp;t=8s)) to completely turning me back to bad old habits. I've had a few up/down days last week but got myself back on track, sticking to my food plan. I was in the shop buying a magazine when I saw on the cover of ELLE the story ""Breaking up with thinness"". I thought it might be at least mildly interesting so I flicked to the full article.

Unfortunately the journalist opened the article describing herself at her ""worst state"": how her friends, family etc. would all beg her to eat before going on to also disclose her weight, height and indirectly her BMI at the time. Instantly I had phone out, googling her weight in kilograms, checking against her ""worst"" her stats to make sure I was thinner.

I know this stuff might help provide shock value to the majority of readers but anorexia is a numbers game to a lot of people. Anyone who has gone through it would know. I was surprised how angry it made me. I had been doing ok but for the rest of the weekend and even yesterday I feel like the anorexia parasite is back and invading my every thought. :/

"The Torture and Pain of Being Betrayed By Your Own Brain Hi. I've never been on the subreddit before, I don't have schizophrenia. However I feel completely and utterly hopeless and mostly  alone,  and (hopefully) I feel like the people on here might possibly be able to relate to me. You see I don't experience what doctors would be able to label as psychosis, but I feel though it is closest to that. 

Background: I have narcolepsy it has mainly symptoms but what i'm mainly going to focus on is sleep paralysis and hallucinations.

What Just Happened: So I go to college in less than a week so I have been extra extra busy. Which means I have been extra extra tired. And yes I take drugs during the day, and I don't really have a problem with being awake. It's a common misconception that the biggest struggle we have is falling asleep in class or while eating cereal which is untrue. I could live with just that honestly, but something I'm really struggling with is when my meds wear off and I'm too tired. Granted I can't remember the last time in my life I have ""slept well"" at night or didn't have horrible nightmares or wake up not being able to breathe or find myself going into sleep paralysis over and over and over again just trying to fall asleep. I wouldn't describe my nights anything less than torture, but nothing like I just experienced. You see when I have a hallucination at night the doctors like to describe it as a glitch, essentially the part of my brain that makes me feel awake and cognitive is still on, but other parts of my brain have already gone into dream state. Basically I am dreaming while I am awake. Usually this will mimic classic delusions, thinking someone is out to get me or is breaking into my house stuff like that. Sometimes I will hear things that aren't there like footsteps or mumbling. I cannot tell these are not based in reality and to me it feels real until a flip switches in my head and it's like waking up, immediate. These delusions obviously suck and every time it happens it doesn't like make it easier the next time, but during the day I don't think about it. I repress all the pain it causes me because it happens all the time and there is nothing I can do but live with them the torture and I have to function and lead a relatively normal life or so my best. 

Today I had a hallucination/delusion I have never experienced and it has left me fearful, paranoid, angry, lost, hopeless and alone. Today I fell into my half wake half nightmare delusional state and at first I was just frustrated, I knew when I was falling asleep this would happen because I was so exhausted my body was already ahead of itself jumping into paralysis before my brain could join in. I tried to just think of one thing and try to lucid dream cus at that point I knew I was already fucked. Not to get explicit but thinking about getting fucked is just the easiest way to like start lucid dreaming for me that way I just end up having a fun sex dream. So that did happen and I still knew that nothing was real up to this point and and I was just having a good time until the dynamic changed dramatically. I could feel myself slipping father out of being in control because things started changing like it's easiest to begin a lucid dream that takes place in ur current location so we were just fucking in my bed but then we were not anymore and we were in a bathroom I had never seen before. Looking back at this point i stopped completely realizing it was not reality. So we were in a bathroom and he had his clothes back on and I was still trying to spice stuff up and continue with the sex we were having but the mood changed a lot. He said no like angering and told me I was annoying and held a rag up to my mouth and everything went black and I had flashbacks to nightmares I had had before. (Sometimes when I am falling into sleep paralysis I get overwhelming fear that if I don't fight it ai will never get out like something is pulling me down that wants bad things for me ) I started to have that fear again but this time I hadn't woken soon enough and they caught me. Things are blurry from here next thing I remember is being half awake knowing that a i was having sleep paralysis. Then I remember having a feeling that I was being controlled and that by being drugged in my dream, which I knew was a dream, had let ""them"" (ifk who they are just like a thing and ai know it's bad) into my brain. Like they now had access to my thoughts and could control me. Only I still knew I was dreaming but there was a shift in that knowing a i was dreaming didn't matter because ainstill thought that Incould be controlled in my dreams and that it was some secret agency or alien that was now in my head. Next I spent what felt like hours in and out of sleep paralysis dreaming and moments of being awake but completely delusional. There's this think that while you are in sleep paralysis when you take or yell u aren't really making any noise only whispering. I would scream for help but ainknew nobody would hear me so I tried and tried my best to get out of sleep paralysis so that I could actually make sound and I found for maybe a few seconds enough to scream out for my mom or brother but also nobody was home and immediately after I would be pulled back under. During sleep paralysis I could hear a laugh or whisper and had a feeling like ""haha we have control over you now"". I convinced myself that it was in my body now and that event tho sleep paralysis and my dream wasn't real I was afraid that this feeling wouldn't go away when I woke up. The feeling that I was being controlled. I could feel it when it was in different parts of my brain and body and at one point I squeezed my muscles in my side trying to fight it because ai thought that it was in my side and now I am awake and my my side muscle aches. These delusional felelinfs and thoughts and hallucinations just got worse and I started to think it wanted to kill me. I could feel it moving around in my brain at that time and I was yelling at it in my head like Inknow you can hear me listen to me please stop etc. And then I felt it moving out of my brain I thought it was going to go to my heart to stop it and ai felt it go into my aorta tovlkke travel through my blood to my heart so i squeezed my neck  muscles and focused all my energy onto the artery  in my neck Idk I thought if i did this it would somewhat help but it only made my heart rate rise, in my sleep as well in real life as i can see on my fit bit. Anyway thankfully this woke me up and out of this and I felt like it could be realcfor a few minutes after but then was like no this is just my brain. This was all me. I just spent over an hour (which felt like a full day because time moves faster in your sleep) physically and mentally torturing myself and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Like ifk how bad my story sounds I'm not good at describing how things actually feel but it honestly feels like torture. Like i am being tortured and when I wake up all I can do is cry because why why does my brain betray me like this. It feels so bad. I was hoping someone on here could relate to that feeling that's what hurts me the most and something I don't really know how to deal with becuase I literwllt have no control. Not many people with narcolepsy experience anything even remotely like this and it's probably because ai have anxiety and trauma separate to the disease not everyone experiences their half dream like states as nightmares. I feel like I have nobody to relate to and Injudt want to be able to complain but when I tell the people close to me they don't get it and it just makes them sad and i feel like a burden to their emotions. Anyways if anybody has anything to say or if they want to talk please respond. Thanks.

"first steps Hey everybody! Today is my first day of sobriety. I've been browsing this subreddit ever since I got off work today. I've been very hesitant with giving up alcohol and knew I was an alcoholic, but kept ignoring the consequences of it. People can't usually tell when I'm drinking unless I'm completely shitfaced, which I was using to my advantage to day drink constantly these past few months.

When I do get shitfaced tho, I start verbal arguments with my boyfriend and my family and friends for no real reasons. The arguments themselves are nonsensical and only serve to hurt people. After an argument last night, I extremely upset my boyfriend and his brother and sister-in-law and mostly shattered what relationship his family and I have. 

I'm trying to be better now. I don't want to be a toxic boyfriend or son or friend. I don't want my behavior to harm people. I've been careless and reckless and need it to stop. I told my boyfriend everything about my alcoholism just now and hes here for me and already trying to help figure out plans for the future.

I freaking hate you. I hate what you do to me. The obsession and the secrecy it all hurts inside. The disgusting things you make me do. The shame I feel every time I let you tell me what to do. I hate you. I was 13 when I first met you. You told me you would help me stop the paintings on my skin. You told me I didn’t need the razor blade anymore. When I was 14, you told me I was fat. You told me if I wanted to eat I had to do a sport.i would run miles everyday. I had to burn every calorie off. 3 years later I would suffer from joint and nerve pain from overexercising. Pain that I still feel every time I walk. When I was 15, you told me I was trying hard enough. You told me I needed to diet. I quickly lost weight. Calories became an obsession. Macronutrients became my life. When I was 16, you allowed me to eat only if I used certain pills to get it out of me. My digestive system would be ruined. When I met my ex-boyfriend, I felt everything would be okay. I felt like I didn’t need to you anymore Mia. I stopped listening to you. When he left me and everything around me fell apart, you were there Mia. When I was suicidal, you reminded me no one who care if I died because who would want to see a fat girl casket. My parents? The shame they would have to special order one for me. When I was 17 years old, you told me to stop eating. I wasn’t worthy to eat. I tried to diet. I tried to not do it. Yet, food was my only comfort. You looked back at me in the mirror shaking your head at me. I couldn’t stop eating. When I was 18, and I moved to college, you told me we could eat again under one condition. We could eat anything we wanted if we purged it after. I would skip classes being leaned over the toilet with [NOT PUTTING IN HERE] my throat. My teeth rotting and my gums bleeding. Every time I burped I felt the acid run up and down my throat.

"Medical emergency This is my first post on r/ptsd. I was diagnosed with ptsd from my work as a first responder. I have been working on stabilization with my therapist so far. I think I've gotten myself into a pretty good routine that keeps me in my window of tolerance. The my of times. I've had to resort to clonazepam to calm myself has decreased.

The other day while grocery shopping I heard a ""code 66"" being called over the PA system. I never heard that code before but I could tell my the tone of the voice it was an emergency call. I immediately felt like I had just heard the pager/tones go off. I froze for a few seconds (felt like forever) debating if I should intervene or just standby. Of course the part of me that made me become a first responder won't let me standby and not do anything. So I dropped my cart and went searching. 

Turns out that is was not a serious emergency and already being handled by staff and an off duty RN. I still did a proper assessment of the situation and patient. I felt meek and dumbfounded while talking. Like it was my very first Rideout as a student. 

Afterwards I felt like a was in a daze and had so many of my hyperarousal symptoms. Luckily I was heading to my therapist appointment immediately afterwards. I almost swerved off the road while driving by over reacting to someone crossing into my lane. 

My therapist successfully brought me back into my window. Made me really appreciate his expertise. I was critical of myself. ""If I can't handle a minor emergency how am I ever going to handle a real one again"" he said to me ""as soon as the announcement was made you were triggered. You didn't know it was minor. Could have been a massive heart attack. You still responded anyway. Your body could not tell the difference"". 

Just wanted to share that with you guys. I'm discovering new things about myself everyday. The next time I doubt my injury I'll use that situation to remind myself. Don't minimalize your trauma/feelings just because you feel the need to be strong to help others. I know I will always respond no matter what. I cannot stand by and do nothing.

"Feeling ego-death and having chills, then having delusions. Anyone? How does psychosis feel qualitatively for you? (My experience) I was sitting in the library, I felt something like ""Ego-death"" (A buddhist concept I'm familiar with, and something I read about after) which feels like you disappear and just spread out. I felt like just sitting there frozen and staring. Then I started thinking about a worm reaching into my brain, and the long white lights on the ceiling were also worms, and the world was going to end ... 

and the sickly swimming, bright green mental 'background' in my mind starting swimming and becoming active. I felt the 'void' alien presence, growing in my mind, going to take me over.
Does anyone know about the 'void', alien presence thing? What's up with that? Who is it and what's it gonna do huh?

Also ... I've been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (or something) ... then told I was mis-diagnosed , then ... this kinda shit keeps happening. ya know.

"Listening to audiobooks or podcasts helps me focus at work. One of the reasons I have a hard time focusing on most of my tasks at work is that there are sooooo many other more interesting things I could be doing! Even when medicated, if the task isn’t interesting to me then my brain goes a million other directions. I end up “just looking something up” online or whatever.... and then discover I’ve just wasted the past hour and have done/read/watched/posted a least a dozen other things since that original thing I was just going to look up really quick. 

I’ve figured out that I’m MUCH less likely to do this if I’m listening to a book or podcast that really interests me. I obviously can’t do this when the current task involves intense reading or writing, and sometimes I have to briefly pause the audio for similar reasons, but it otherwise really helps me stay on task. 

Listening to something I find really interesting just seems to keep my brain occupied and less likely to stray to random shit that leads me down an online rabbit hole.

"Can a breakup cause trauma? Hi everyone,

I feel stupid coming on here. After all, there’s so many people who have been through so much, and a breakup is considered “normal” even though it causes a lot of emotional pain. My breakup did trigger suicidal thoughts and I almost acted on them because I was in so much pain, but I didn’t do anything.

However, something really isn’t right. I feel much better than I did five months ago (I’m loving life again and I’m exploring many hobbies I want to try), and I’m over my ex, but there’s a couple of issues. Firstly, I kept having really vivid dreams of my ex up until about a week ago, getting really emotional and vowing to talk to him when I woke up. However, when I did wake up, I didn’t want to message him at all. 

Secondly, but I can’t remember anything from my relationship. Sometimes I’ll get vivid flashbacks of things from the past, but then it’s immediately forgotten. Not only that, but when my ex-friend declared last week that she was dating my ex, it triggered the flashbacks more. Why can I not remember anything from my relationship? Is this normal, or is my mind trying to protect me from trauma? Thanks for any advice.",ptsd,ptsd

"Date with a girl with autism - Please advise~ Hey /r/autism,

So, I've met a lovely girl on a dating website - We've had a little chat and have agreed to meet up next week for a date. She describes herself as having mild autism and a couple of other mental health issues, which have significant effect on her life. 

One of these effects is that she has not dated anyone before (She is 27).

I have some things I am wondering about, worrying about, and thinking about and I would like some advice / comments to see if I am overthinking things or whatever. 

I've done a little reading online, and checked out some previous posts about dating on this subreddit plus the sidebar. I apologise if I have missed this information somewhere. 

- She has often said things about my appearance, like how hot I am, etc. from the pictures on my profile. I am not used to women being so complimentary about my appearance (which I consider fairly average), and I am concerned that she is saying these things because she thinks they are expected. This leads to me being concerned that she might try and initiate some physical contact before she is happy / comfortable with it, which I wouldn't want at all.
- I do not know specifically how her mental health affects her exactly. Is this something I should ask when we meet? Any suggestions on how to bring it up? My instinct is to just be forward and tell her I would like to know, so that I don't do anything to confuse or upset her, or avoid as much as possible. She shares many interests with me, and I don't want our conversations to be focused on her mental health. 
- She has said she has a very overprotective family. Anyone have any advice to do with that? (Maybe past experiences)

Am I overthinking this? My biggest fear is that I will mess up, upset her and crush her confidence toward dating in the future if it doesn't work out between us.

Thanks for reading -- I guess it could've been a bit more concise... 

TL;DR - Got a date with a girl with autism, don't want to do anything stupid. Any advice?",autism,autism
"Dad drinking heavy, dont know what to do Hello, so i moved away for 2 years and came back home. My dad's drinking habits have become worse. Before when we were a huge family he only drank beer when we had sauna nights each saturday, or just a couple after work. I mean would be better if he hadn't drank at all but still. 

Now it has gotten so bad. He secretly hides his hard liquor. We own a cafe so he steals from the cabinet which is for customers. I honestly don't know what to do anymore.

We have to keep building the 3 houses my mom worked hard for. They need renovating and one house needs a total new roof etc. My dad is just drinking the money away.

My mom's health has gone even worse, she can't even make 30 pies anymore without tiring her hands out. She can't even stand because of Plantar fascia. 

I can't rely on my older sister because she isn't that close with parents anymore, she hardly even visits anymore. Last time i told her about dad, she did talk to mom but mom lied about sister calling. I guess mom didn't want sister to worry.

I got some therapy numbers from my new school. Also mom pushed dad to see the family doctor, should i secretly call the doctor and tell her to talk to dad about the drinking problem?

My mom has had countless deep conversations with dad about his drinking problems but none seems to work. I know alcoholism is a sickness but if the person really wants to overcome it then he should show some signs. But he's just lazying around, eating+drinking the money away and my mom keeps getting older and older.

"I could end up back in hospital tomorrow if I tell my doctor the truth I don't know what to do. I've been hiding what's been going on with me for 2 weeks now because I know that they'll put me in the hospital. They don't know anything yet but my family is bringing me to the doctor's tomorrow after I finally told them.

2 weeks ago I felt my personality change drastically. I started feeling like there was this powerful energy manipulating me. It was like I was watching myself doing things without being fully present, like I knew I was doing certain actions but I had little control over it. This involved trespassing, fare dodging, graffiti, snapping at people (which I never do) &amp; carrying a knife with me everywhere. I felt like an unstoppable force. I felt above all law. And I got an adrenaline rush from everything. I didn't care if I got caught.

It started coming into my thoughts. I wasn't being told by voices to do anything. It was just this feeling like I knew what had to be done. Most of it was like having no impulse control. But this powerful energy I'm feeling has to be real. It's like nothing I've ever felt before. What if I'm meant to follow it? They can't put me in hospital if that's the case. I get compulsions out of nowhere. Stand on the road, hop trains &amp; get as far away as possible, go to another country. I feel like something is pushing me to do all these things.

I feel like I'm connected to whatever this energy is and I'm not about to let go of it. So how does anyone think I can tell the doctor all this? I know they'll put me back in &amp; I don't think that's what I need.

If I don't tell the truth my family are going to do everything possible to get me admitted.

The only option is to section me again. I just want to run off. I know that with the way I am I just won't agree to go willingly. I feel like I can't stop what's most likely gonna happen. It's so hard being forced to fuck myself over. I don't think I'm sick I just think I'm struggling to explain what's really happening.

"Relationships / isolation On and off meds but currently on and seeing therapist, I hold a job where I'm social. I don't disclose often to others often though sometimes I allude to various symptoms. No one ever mentions ""do you have schizophrenia?"" even when I say I'm paranoid about being poisoned, or followed to friends or dates.... but I like to allude rather than divulge due to stigma and past situations of being abandoned due to the illness.... 

I found myself really getting to know a woman online off a dating app and we met up a few times but now I haven't seen her for months. We didn't have sex ever. I probably could if I wanted to. She likes me, and She still seems excited to speak to me when I can get out of my head to reply to her even despite me cancelling many times and being distant.... I like her a lot and we have a lot in common but I get paranoid and am afraid of things progressing. I'm afraid of being rejected when I would inevitably have to plainly say ""I have schizophrenia"" -- I go on other dates with women even though I don't let any get too close to me either. I've also been paranoid eating out with the first girl, deluding myself to think she would tamper with the food. 

She's the only one who has stood out in a way that makes me think she might not judge me, but I just can't bring myself to get close although I don't want to lose her either. I find myself stringing her along hoping that I feel ""up to it"" one day. She made it clear it hurt when I cancelled a few times.... I feel horrible about this too. 

I guess I just wonder if anyone has been in a situation where they did want to be with someone, but their symptoms held them back from progressing? My therapist told me it's common and that I need to focus on self care (I had a psychosis breakdown last year when off my meds) and the rest will come naturally but I have lost women in the past because of neglect and I'm afraid it will happen again because of the paranoia, and just not feeling like I have the emotional energy. 

I don't want to be hurt. Dating new women has been a distraction but I honestly don't know why I'm not letting the one I actually like see me.

"I finally know why it has been so hard throughout my life.

I grew up not having a lot of friends and which til this day I am reluctant to have friends due to the reason they might find me annoying. Failed the 4th grade, and struggled through middle school and eventually high school. People just labeled me a problem child or troubled kid. which I wasn't a bad kid, just I acted out, played around, talked too much. Ended up dropping out of high school, and eventually got the GED 2 yrs after. I started to work in the ER as a Scribe and I liked it, Fast paced and good pay. now 8yrs since then, I'm in college, going for RN. So difficult to complete my homework let alone read my chapters. We just recently went over the Mental health and ADHD, and during lecture, it was describing me, and which I was like ""WTF"" I spoke to my professors and even a mental health FNP, and they all agree I have ADHD, and which tell me to go talk to my Doctor about it. but I think about it, and just think to myself, i act the way I do not cause I'm immature or childish, its how my mind works, blaming myself for a lot of being ""lazy"" in school, not trying hard enough, and just being labeled as ""that annoying kid"". I tried to control my behavior throughout my life so far, and which I asked my mom why we never been seen by a specialist when I was younger, she said I wasn't bad.

should I try to tell my professors about it and see if I can try do an alternative assignment? I am very scared, one of my professor seem strict, she may not allow me. I have been feeling sick and nauseous everyday for weeks, its stuff like these that makes me wish I didn't exist!! :/",ptsd,ptsd

"Just a tad overwhelmed now. Hi.   I was just diagnosed with autism around Christmas.   I am 64 yo female.

I am still gobstruck that personal behaviors and idiosyncrasies that i have never even mentioned aloud to anyone were cited in information that i found on websites specializing in   autism manifestations specific to females.  Every point of my life described in detail.  Things i never would have dared revealing since i would fear being tagged as being mentally ill. 

I actually accomplished a fair bit, mostly due to my conviction i was a bit slow, and had to work 1000 %  harder to compensate for my flaws.  So, my aspie ability to singlemindedly focus on my goals allowed me to acheive many of them.

I accomplished by regulating my executive function duties to planners, habits, and repetition.

Things fall apart.  I had a catastrophic illness 30 years ago, and have been disabled ever since.  I lost all i achieved.  I no longer have the strength and capaciity to plough through it.  

I told my mom about my diagnosis because i hoped she would take into consideration that some of the major disagreements we have had in the last couple of years were influenced by my deficits in communications.  We had a major misunderstanding about being able to inherit some of her mother's furniture.  We had discussed it 40 years ago, but i had thought she was referring to furniture she had sent to auction of her mother's estate.

My mother then, has steadfastly ignored this misunderstanding, and passed on the treasures i associated with my grandparents to younger siblings that immediately physically destroyed them in their amalgamation of them into their households.

When i told her I had been diagnosed as autistic, she immediately told other people in the family although i requested that she keep it confidential. She outed me publically. No, she does not have Alzheimer's.   No, i have not seen her act with as malicious casual disregard ever in my life.

She has cut me out of the family by giving heritage resources to her other children, and pointedly omitting me.

She has irrevocably damaged my relationship with those same sibs by outing me without my consent. At this point, i would have preferred to deal with things at my discretion.


I am so alone, i don't know how to move forward through this.  I am in an autistic burnout phase.  The skills i had used to compensate for my deficits have dribbled to occasional drops of appropriateness.  I am under overwhelming stress, and daily, my brain is frozen.  My home is starting to look like i'm a hoarder, i can't decide things.

My doctor is helpful, but this is new to her too,  this is all coming at a tim that is critical.  I cannot find even a little assistance, and am terrified of people invading my life.

I’m very scared and nervous. I’d just like some advice for some of the beginning steps. This just seems surreal and I am (somewhat) aware of the mental and physical challenges that will come along with it. I’m considering moving back home with them so they can help me along the way.

"I'm 22 months sober. This is my third run at sobriety, my first lasted a month, second one 17 months. I know this one will stick but now I suffer from anxiety (sometimes severe). I think it's a combination of always having anxiety and noises I don't have my original coping mechanism (alcohol) and also due to the fact that now I worry about the harm I inflicted on myself from the decade of heavy drinking.

I started drinking at age 14, a few beers here or there, but before I was 14 I was drinking nearly every night. I drank all through high school, and really hit the booze hard when I was 18. I suffered a lot of trauma at that time, some partly brought on by my drinking I'd say.  Anyways, I was drinking 5 nights a week I'd say, 10 or 12 beers a night, and when I'd party I'd drink some liquor as well.  I'd go on binders, drink alone, drink with people, I was angry, sad, suicidal (I think) however now looking back it may have been a front, a cry for help if you will. I drank, I took pills, did whatever drugs were put in front of me. I would drink 30 packs, fifths, I'd sleep maybe two hours after partying all night and wake up and start drinking as soon as my ass left the bed. I was court ordered to a mental health facility for a rather se ere self inflicted wound. And I repeated this behavior until I had my daughter at age 24. 

I slowed down exponentially and quit for 17 months. When i relapsed or fell off the wagon or started drinking again or whatever was around the holidays. It was nothing like before, i had/have a child that I love with my whole fiber, this time i drank in moderation, only allowing myself 3 drinks when I would drink. I thought I was cured. When i started noticing myself dreading the third drink because i knew it was my last i realized i wasn't well and that i needed to stop for good, AND HERE I AM TODAY.

I know I would probably be dead by now if I continued drinking the way I did and I'm grateful for every single sover day I have but sometimes the anxiety and the guilt gets so heavy. The guilt I have from the pain and worry I put my loved ones through. I love my wife so incredibly much, she is a wonderful woman and she helped me beat my dependence. She is a wonderful mother and we have a great life together but sometimes the darkness comes over me, it's not a craving to drink although sometimes I find it sad I cant drink moderately the way others can, it's just a dark despairing feeling, that the addiction already beat me somehow. Its extremely tough to explain. Maybe it's just trauma I created for myself from all of those years.

Anyways, I'm not really sure if anyone will read this or why I even typed it out. I am just laying here in bed and cant fall asleep and wanted to share my experience, maybe some good will come from it, maybe i will feel better, maybe someone else will benefit from reading it. Who knows,but if you have made it this far, good luck and goodnight. May you find peace and keep it.",alcoholism,alcoholism
"Eye contact I have not been diagnosed (I'm waiting on an appointment...) but while reading about ASD I read a lot about eye contact being uncomfortable to people (on the spectrum).

"Chronic boredom that results in a feeling of melancholy depression. Could this be undiagnosed adhd? Hey everyone. I am a 21 year-old female who has struggled with feelings of chronic boredom, depression, and anxiety my entire life. I only really feel “happy” and stimulated when playing a video game, watching tv, or out somewhere environmentally interesting like a store or a concert. When I am not doing those things (or immediately after) I feel really depressed and bored. For example, I enjoy doing yoga and did some this morning. It was a 30 minute video. I felt unbelievably bored and unable to focus even though I know I enjoy doing it and feel “happy.” It’s like I just can’t get through normal activities that I enjoy because they’re so boring. I’m wondering if it’s possible this is undiagnosed adhd rather than just depression as I have always assumed it was. I also have a really tough time listening to my fiancé or best friend talk for longer than a couple of minutes at a time as my mind starts wandering or I just kind of zone out, even if I try really hard to focus. Same thing happened in school or when studying. Feel free to ask any further questions for clarification. Thanks!

Edit: Necessary point I hadn’t thought to make originally: I know nobody here can diagnose me and that I need to meet with a psychiatrist. I don’t have insurance at the moment, so I was hoping if you guys suspect it is adhd, until I can afford to see a psychiatrist I might be able to try some coping techniques specifically for adhd instead of depression.",adhd,adhd
"Is he an alcoholic? My (38) husband (41) tends to get very angry when he’s drunk. If he has a few drinks, he’s fun and joyful. If he’s just with his friends? He usually ends up fine even after a few *more* drinks. But if I’m around? I tip toe. He tends to get angry with me easily when he drinks. 
Today, our two children and I went to a tailgate with him. My husband got so drunk that he forgot he had a drink and went to the bar to get another drink. I got upset, frustrated that I was (once again) the responsible parent. When he came back to us I told him I was angry and he tried to take out kids and walk away. I got my 9 year old away but our 15 year old insisted on going with him. I followed telling my husband it wasn’t safe (to drive him) and he let loose on me, every name in the book, every word in there, too. I rubbed his shoulder to try and calm him down and told him I just wanted our kids to be safe over and over while he kept yelling. He smacked my arm hard and walked away. 
A man standing across  from me caught my eye as my husband walked away and his mouth fell open. He began to approach me but I bolted to find my younger son. I got us an Uber while my husband texted me that I’d ended our marriage and to enjoy my car (he just bought me a nice car this week). 
He drove himself and our older son home. Not safe. I was in the shower when he got home and he stared me down after a very long pee. He waited until I looked at him and then went to bed to fall asleep. 
He doesn’t get this drunk often. Maybe once or twice a month. He doesn’t always get angry when he’s drunk, but he does often enough that it upsets me. 
I don’t think he’s an alcoholic. But I know he gets very angry when he drinks, mostly with me. And I don’t know what to do. Does he need help?

"(USA, my experience) Prescribed Ritalin, Concerta: was terrible. Now on Adderall XR, but still not great. Could it be the generic brand I request? Other options? Hello,

I'm 21, female, in college and weight about 130lbs. Athletic, eat well, take vitamin supplements (at night). 

I've included my experience with each prescription below, but my main question is: **Are there variations between generic brands that manufacture Adderall? Do you prefer one over the others and why?**

My Experiences: Ritalin, Concerta, Now Adderall:

**Ritalin:**

I was first prescribed 10mg (generic) to take 2 in the morning and another in the afternoon, for a total of 30mg/day. It was probably the most terrible shit I've ever had ever with a drug. I don't remember the generic brand, but it was just horrible. I felt anxious, irritable, frustrated constantly while on it (either on or off it) and the ups and downs throughout the day because it was IR were bad. 

I had lapses of where I felt like I was even myself; I'm usually sensitive or at least conscious about people's feelings, but I approached everything like it was a chore, even my friends. On one occasion I kicked my boyfriend out when he was staying over because the anxiety of what I had to do the next day was overwhelming and he was ""irritating"" me too much. No remorse either; I felt like a completely different person. Also, it didn't last as long as it said it would; about 2-3 hours of productivity on 20mg. 

So I asked for something longer-lasting, and for my schedule that makes sense:

**Concerta** 

(generic again) was a bit better. I think I was prescribed at 36mg, and that would last me all day. It's basically long-lasting ritalin though, so it had the same side effects minus the downs throughout the day. I remained frustrated/irritable and would often be curt with people. However, it was much easier to focus on work (at least task-oriented, mindless problems) I got a lot of cleaning, organizing done with this. I didn't lose my phone/etc anymore, and my apartment was spotless. 

As soon as it kicked in in the morning I had no problem getting up and getting shit done. But I remember the constant frustration on it, and the feelings of near-angry irritability when coming down off it (at like 4pm if I took it at 8am) sucked. Left me with basically half a day to just lay on the couch and hate myself, pissed off and unable to do anything. (my doc said to take a boost of 10mg in the afternoon, but I found doing that didn't last long- 2 hrs maybe, and left me with a worse comedown.)

Functionally, when it came to focus, Concerta really helped me with my math problem sets, but I felt like when it came to writing the best I could do was literally copyright- I just would write the same shit I was reading from a text- instead of being able to put it in my own words. Where I am now in school, I prioritize writing over math, so I asked for something different. 

I was put on **Adderall XR** 10mg, to take 2 in the morning. I was told this dose of 20mg of Adderall would be about equivalent of the dose of Concerta i was taking, is that true? It's the generic brand ""Actavis,"" and the 10mg XR is a white and blue capsule with ""3059"" on it. So far, my impression has been ""meh."" 

**Adderall XR CONS:**

- I don't have the hyper-focus I did on Concerta, my room is messy and I haven't yet done the dishes, it definitely does not help me as much with math. 
- Makes me a bit nauseous sometimes; I've combatted this by taking magnesium in the morning with it after breakfast. 
- I feel more disorganized, I've forgotten some things; I've gone back to habitual double-checking if everything is in it's place in case I leave something behind, etc. 


**Adderall XR PROS:**

- I am no longer the piece of shit to people I was on Concerta; I don't feel like I'm ""faking"" or undertaking some great effort to be interested in or nice to people. 
- I can write relatively well on this. I make some grammatical errors that I don't seem to catch though. 
- It lasts longer than the Concerta, but it is easier to fall asleep at the end of the day.
- I actually get hungry, remember the food in my fridge I need to use, and enjoy eating when it wears off. Concerta was like NO hunger at all, ever. It was a chore to force myself to eat, I would forget food I bought. Even when it wore off I didn't feel ""hungry.""  
- Not sure if this is technically a ""pro,"" but I only feel sad/self conscious about what people think of me when I come down off it (which is around the time I'm going to bed anyway). I'd take that over feeling angrily irritable. 
 

**Conclusion:** 

I think I might be a bit more distractible on the Adderall than the Concerta, at least in terms of tasked skills- cleaning, math, getting bills paid, doing mundane planned things. With concerta, I was almost OCD about keeping things in their place and my place clean.

Adderall gives me more ""flexibility"" or creativity, if that makes sense- I can creatively think about solutions to problems and come up with a plan; such as with writing papers- though I do believe the distractibility derails me when I should be writing and instead I'm researching everything I can find about a topic. It helps with actually sticking to a paper outline much more than Concerta though. Overall, I'd say I prefer the Adderall.

**QUESTIONS:**

- Has anyone tried **Actavis XR Adderall,** and have your experiences been similar or different than mine?

- Has anyone tried or compared generics **Sandoz XR **or **Prasco XR?** I have read on other threads these have less inactive filler ingredients (9) than most generics. (compared to Actavis' 18). 

I'm fairly confused if anything has changed with branding, etc for 2018, because these companies/brands seem to be buying each other/changing formulas all the time, and I'd like to stick to generic XR because that's what is cheapest, but I'm wondering if I should just go with Brand XR (not sure who produces this). I'm trying to be the most informed I can before I meet with my doctor again, because I'm not sure I want to go up in dosage if I don't have to.

"How to feel valid (tm) enough to look for a therapist specialised in trauma? CW: CSA, but nothing graphic


My last therapist basically told me she couldn't help me and I needed someone that was more long term &amp; past-focused and not so much CBT-based.

"Want to Share a bit of my Story (TW: sexual abuse) So right now I'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment I've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse I endured as a very young adult. I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. 

Because being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. 

This story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:

Well I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. 

He was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. 

And meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). 

In the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.

There were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.

 While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. 

This man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.

 I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy. I have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and I don't think I'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. 

I don't live with a victim mentality but I think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me.

"Weird side effects from Dex and feedback needed about Strattera Hi all,
I’m a 51 year old woman that’s just recently been diagnosed ADHD-PI and was prescribed dexamphetamine 5mg x 3 times a day. 

Just for some background, I’ve never taken a prescription for anything in my life before and don’t drink or smoke or do any kind of drugs as I’m prone to migraines :(

Ok so the first afternoon I take the 5mg dex and within an hour my neck and jaw muscles start to spasm. Not good but I want to try this medication, so the next day I take the prescribed doses.

More jaw clenching and auras like migraine. I take loads of magnesium to help the muscle spasms and 3mg of melatonin to get to sleep.

I wake up with what felt like my brain literally on fire! Which persisted for the next 3 days without taking anymore medication. Couldn’t stand any light and couldn’t function due to the massive pain in my head. Very similar to migraine and yet not exactly the same. Very strange!

My psych said she has never heard of anyone having this side effects. Has anyone here had something similar or got any insight? 

My migraine triggers are histamine/mast cell related.

I have now been prescribed Strattera, but after reading the side effects (which include migraine) I am feeling rather gun shy :/ 

Any migraine sufferers here successfully using Strattera?

Edit: Family history of depression, bipolar and borderline personality disorders.

I also have symptoms of social anxiety and rejection sensitivity, depersonalisation/derealisation.

I rarely take the Adzenyz XR and have been taking Dex IR for a while. I think I need to switch to dif meds tho.. thoughts?


I feel overstimulated when I take dex. Like I’ll go to the library and take my dex with hopes of studying/doing work and feel like I literally can’t start studying or do my work. Nothing feels good. I’m always listening to music or watching youtube videos or on reddit. It feels like there is a mental block in my head where I physically can’t get things done. 

I have pulled all nighters in the library and have been talking to myself in my head the entire time lol and spend 8 hours in the lib getting 1 hour worth of work done. The only difference between me taking it or not is that if I dont I have zero motivation to study at all, and when I do take it I’ll go to the library and want to get work done, but just can’t.

"I’ve been drunk for almost half my life. The thought of being sober is something I can’t comprehend. A couple of years ago I was sober for a month then I got with some chick and felt like I had to drink to feel comfortable around her. She was a tattoo artist so she was “edgy”. I obviously never got sober again, I’m also not with her. Been through a couple more women since. 

I feel like with every break up it gets worse. I’m sure my alcoholism has been a factor in the break ups, but at the end of them they all seem to show that they are all very superficial. So that in return makes me head harder into my alcohol. All I do is go home from work immediately start drinking and try to make music. This might sound stupid but I can’t play video games anymore. I used to love them. I never go out because I feel like I’ll be the one that gets way more drunk than everyone and make a complete ass of myself. 

I can’t even begin to explain how fucking lonely this world feels. Growing up I didn’t have a conventional family. My father wasn’t there. My mom killed herself while also trying to take my brother with her. It feels like literally no one on this earth cares about you or that you exist. 

I feel like I hold the weight of the universe in my chest. Nothing makes sense anymore. 

I feel like when I drink it’s like the key to a magical door that transports me to another world where all I have are my thoughts. It’s just not a happy magical place. But for some reason it’s comfortable. 

I can’t even afford to have this habit. I don’t get paid shit at my dead end job, but for some reason I keep going back to it. I’ll wake up feeling like shit, regretful, but as soon as night hits and I’m feeling better it’s like I completely forget why I shouldn’t.

Longtime lurker on this sub, finally had my appointment with a psychatrist yesterday and got my diagnosis of being combined type ADHD. It was a massive relief. I feel like I have known my entire life that something wasnt right. Despite being intelligent (apparently), I cannot focus on most conversations. I had to ask the psych to repeat himself numerous times because I missed what he was saying. I forget EVERYTHING. I have trouble maintaining friendships. 

During the consultation, the psych also flagged up that I had numerous traits that show I also have ASD. I was happy to get my ADHD diagnosis, but the possibility I also have ASD is freaking me out. I feel like I dont want it. I'm not 100% sure why. I will now be getting an ASD assessment too, because I feel I have to know either way. 

I'm also going to be put on medication...from googling my doctor, he usually puts people on 18mg Concerta before increasing the dose to 27mg. 

I just wondered what experience others have had of being co-diagnosed with ASD, and how they found the medication. I am naturally a very anxious person, and being put onto medication that can make you feel anxious/sleep less/eat less is freaking me out!

TL:DR: Just been diagnosed with ADHD and possible ASD. Struggling to process it. It's freaking me out. ",adhd,adhd

"Frustrated from seeing psychologist Been really busy this week but I thought I would share my experience. I went to a doctor to tell her how I have been feeling and suspected that I had ADHD for a long time and was met with suspicion. I felt like I was trying to convince her because no matter what I said she was thinking “there’s no way she has ADHD. ” She also kept correcting me on what I was saying and said that a person with ADHD would not struggle with motivation but instead the focus to complete a task. Then each time she interrupted me I reacted by interrupting her back. My point to her was that I struggle with having the desire to start/finish a task and just happened to use the “wrong” word? It just resulted in me not opening up and telling her how I really felt because I was met with disapproving looks and a dismissive attitude.  She also took my self survey and said “yeah...I think you definitely have something. ”

Any thoughts on this? Did I use the wrong wording or anything? This was my first time seeing a psychologist for anything and to be honest, I thought it would have helped more than it did. ",adhd,adhd

Hello everyone,

My 2 year old son has been diagnosed since April. He is diagnosed as severe on the social scale. We have had a grueling time getting his ABA started because our health insurance ""accidentally put a hold"" on his request and hadn't noticed until I called and now in August I barely gave ABA our availability for them to create a schedule.

I work part time right now 1 day on the weekend on 1 night shift during the week. When he was getting testing, with all the appointments and stress I decided to cut back my hours. Talking to other moms I've realized that I'm not the only one who needs help balancing everything from cooking, bathing, cleaning, working, play time, taking him to his day care 3 times per week, etc...

I decided to go back to school taking online classes in order to help us have a better life, because I don't have a college degree. What I am wondering here is, do you think it is a waste of time? I know that once he turns 3 years old he will go to more school in the public system called Early Intervention, but I'm starting to question whether I should continue spending time and energy going back to college. I know it couldn't necessarily hurt, but if my son is not going to be independent and will need me, I wonder if I will be able to use my degree or if I will just be at home as his caretaker.

I understand there are some jobs that allow you to work from home or are part time so of course there is hope.

Obviously I know I cannot predict the future and neither can you, and I don't want to be a pessimist, I just would like to know what your perspectives are and your experiences with your children and their needs as they grow up and how that coincides with your work schedules. I am not one that ha a lot of money for babysitters and even if I did, I do want to care for him and wouldn't want him to be with a babysitter all the time.

"Parents So
I’m 27. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was I child and I went to therapy for a couple of years to learn to focus better on schoolwork. My schoolwork improved and since that time I have almost never been to a therapist since, and not for ADD. 
But I recently listened to a TED talk and I realized how much it has affected me as an adult. (Anyone else had to change the locks after losing your keys multiple times?) 
There are a lot of things that suggest my ADD has not “gone away,” as I guess my parents and I had thought. 

So I mentioned this TED talk to my dad a while ago, and then forgot about it. Today I was with him after mischeduling an appointment for the second time and I got really upset. On the way home he was trying to be supportive (but also lecture me) and then he dropped in a “you can’t let your ADD be an excuse for things you can do”. I hadn’t mentionedy ADD but I guess he must have recalled that I had mentioned it a while ago. 

This. Is. So. Frustrating. 
We’ve had this sort of conversation before where he says ‘this is totally within your power- you can do this’, and at some point I’ve said to him “but I’m not.” 

I. I’m at a loss. My father knows this about me but somehow seems unable to reconcile that there are times (often close together) where shit like this falls apart for me. And then I get to hear about how I’m not trying hard enough. Like I’m not doing the work, or acting lazy.

"How to Think About Willpower I'm in university right now studying as a full-time student. I'm taking a Philosophy class that is about understanding human patterns of thinking. The class focuses on the reasons we think the things we do and gives tips and resources to improve our own thought patterns.


Pretty cool class. Anyways, we were talking about willpower which is the reason I decided to write up this post for you guys.


The two main ways willpower is viewed in philosophy is 1) It is a finite and usable resource (kind of like an energy bar in a video game). So, writing up a paper may deplete some of your willpower energy.


The alternative is that willpower is smart usage of attention. Every time we do something, we are using our attention on that task. Whether the task is pleasurable or not impacts how likely we are to perform that task. So, if you had to direct your attention to write a paper or you had to direct your attention to play your favorite video game, it is more likely that you would want to play the game. This is because there is less negative feelings associated with that particular activity.


The professor starts talking about these two methods of viewing willpower and goes into some studies. It turns out that those who were willpower as a finite resource will perform worse on tasks than those who do not view it as such. Additionally, when tasked with many items to complete, those who view willpower as finite will consistently perform worse. I don't have the studies off my memory, but can dig it up if this post gets big enough.


This really made me think about the way I view willpower, which I am assuming is the same for my fellow ADHDers out there. Constantly, I tell myself I'm too tired, exhausted from the day, to even try to finish up my work. I have started trying to view willpower as smart usage of attention and found improvement. 


Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a solution. The actual process of taking our attention and using it in a way that furthers our goals is almost impossible for many of us. But I have found that simply by changing the way I perceive willpower, I'm able to feel better about the tasks that I do complete. I've found that instead of not doing something because ""I'm just so exhausted"" that I will think about it as just another direction of my attention. 


It's been helping out with preventing me beating myself up for not doing things and seems to be just a better way to think about willpower so as to finish up all this work I have to do. 


I just wanted to share this with you guys because I've gotten so much from the community and want to give back a little. Try this change in perspective for a few days and let me know what you all think! Comment if you'd like any clarification or if you have questions for me :)

now that she’s back, i sometimes still think of that time and i have to cry when i think about it and my heart starts beating faster. i was so under pressure and full of stress. i don’t know how i survived this.. i’m going to ask my therapist this week, but i wanted to ask you guys here too.",ptsd,ptsd
"I need a little guidance. First things first I'm not diagnosed with schizophrenia but I am diagnosed with BPD. But I've been seeing and hearing things that I know aren't real but at the same time I'm not so sure. I've tried to find information with hallucinations tied to BPD but there wasn't a whole lot I could find. 

Something I experience a lot is seeing things in the corner of my eye and when I go to look, it's gone. 
I also experience hearing multiple voices in my head that tell me all sorts of nasty things about me, convince me I'm being watched when I'm in public and tell me that people only want me around to use me,  hurt me or pity me.

I also experience very strong auditory hallucinations with things away from me, like for example yesterday I heard 6 different planes fly over my apartment building. It's common to hear one plane fly over and you can see it when you look out the window and it'll also shake the walls but I couldn't see them yesterday and they didn't shake the walls. But I was convinced 6 different planes flew over one after the other. And I was mad no one else in the apartment block were as concerned about it as me. I could hear the neighbours laughing and chatting on the ground floor but no one sounded concerned or questioned it. Im convinced it happened.

I also have episodes where I have tactile hallucinations. It's usually a paramedic that I feel is there (I dunno why) or a human male like figure. I've never seen him but I could tell you exactly what he looks like because his presence is so damn strong.

Something else I've been experiencing a lot very recently is not feeling like I'm apart of my body. Like I know I'm blinking or moving my fingers but it doesn't feel like they're my eyes or my fingers. It's if like my ""soul"" is 90% detached from my body and every movement or thought I have is foreign. That also includes where I am at the time, like my room isn't my room or my bed isn't my bed. 

I've also shut out all of my friends and acquaintances, I deleted all of my social medias a month ago, changed my number and have tried to go off the grid as much as possible.

I'm worried this is going to get worse but I'm so incredibly scared that if I told a medical professional what I'm experiencing they'll say that it's all a delusion and I'm making it up. I'm scared they'll say ""oh but people with schizophrenia don't know they have it so you're lying"". But I know that's not true? Is that true? 
For me personally I sometimes know what I'm experiencing isn't real, I don't know how I know that but I just do. And sometimes I'm convinced it's real and my partner has to tell me it's not. 

I'm scared of being labelled as crazy or a liar and I don't know what to do. 
I'm sorry if my post is in the wrong subreddit or I'm crossing any boundaries. I'm just so scared and I would really like some guidance on what I should do from here. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you all find something to smile about today ❤️

"EMDR Vivid Dreams I had my very first EMDR session yesterday. I spent about 40 minutes building a safe/calm space with my therapist. Last night, though, I had crazily vivid, traumatic dreams, to the point where I’m scared to go to sleep tonight.

"how do you deal with work/life responsibilities while having anxiety? last month my sister  (35) had a panic attack, so she went to 2 psychologists. and they diagnosed her with ptsd.  they brought childhood memories to the forefront an made them more stressful. they suggested a 14,000 dollar treatment program.  

Since getting a diagnosis and having the memories brought up my sister, who  has decided she cant go to work anymore. and is on the verge of losing a well paying career with the federal government.  And because myself sister has no savings, her psychological problems are on the verge of causing her real life survival problems.

I guess my question is, how did you deal with your condition while still dealing with the critical work/life issues?   how can I suggest she chill out?  tell her that she needs to meeting her daily survival needs while  pursuing treatment?  I dont want to downplay her condition but she has  happily thrived with her upbringing until now. she should be able to keep it together and take nursing her mental health one day at a time right?",ptsd,ptsd

"I galaxy brained and now my food hoarding problem is a cool adult snack party box! I know this probably sounds super simple, and super like, ""so what?"" or obvious to people to do but...

My ED developed due to poverty (and acts and behaves a lot like anorexia now) and, so, from an early age, I would hide food all over my room, and, ironically, with this mindset of, ""I have to steal this food and I have to hide this food and I have to keep this food"" I ended up wasting a lot of it due to it expiring because I wanted to preserve it for so long.

Unfortunately, it would also just start to blend in with the trash and clutter in my room. I wouldn't even recognize it as an option when I looked around my room.

This is... still an issue for me, fifteen years later. 

Well!! I'm REALLY excited, and, I know maybe I shouldn't be because this isn't that big of a deal? But? It occurred to me, ""I'm an adult! I don't have to hide my food anymore! I don't have to worry about somebody taking my food! I CAN KEEP IT ALL IN ONE PLACE!"" And so, I've pulled out a box, and I scowered my room for any Still Viable snacks I've hoarded away, and I put it all in that one box under my desk next to my computer chair! It's all in one place!! Nothing will go to waste!! And nothing is allowed in there but yummy stuff when I need it!

"Six-hour lasting flashback I have to go through a medical procedure later today. In preparation for the procedure, I had to take some medications that give me back side effects. 
I’ve had to go through the same procedure a few years ago, while I was still in an abusive relationship. My tormentor ex used the side effects of the medications in order to torture me even more than usual.
So yesterday I had to take those medications and go through the side effects again. Little did I know, that as soon as the side effects began, they brought with them a massive flashback, that lasted for the duration of the effect of the meds, which was about 6 hours. 
I’ve tried different relaxation techniques, used my MMJ, had great support from my fiancée and even tried to take sedatives but NOTHING WORKED. I eventually fell asleep exhausted, into a restless sleep filled with nightmares.

I'd rather sit here on my phone at a lively bar, alone, watch chive TV, eat and drink. Then go back to my hotel and pass out. Wake up, answer emails, make the calls, whatever and then try and find something to do all day that isn't drinking. Yes I travel for work, 10 mos a year.

"Let’s talk about withdrawals for a sec. So I’ve been a heavy drinker for 15ish years. In recent months I’ve gone between cutting back, quitting completely, and going all out on a few pints of vodka. 

For the holiday it was pretty much a 2 day binge. I felt fine on Friday but then drank a shit ton on vodka that evening. 

I woke up yesterday feeling slightly feverish, nauseated and have a headache that won’t stop. Today has been more of the same. Also very fatigued and haven’t really left my bed. I am still feverish today - I go from freezing cold to sweating my ass off. No shakes. My appetite is ok. Not great but I am craving chicken and stars. 

Now, I have Valium that the dr prescribed me for withdrawals because we have no detox centers around here AND the er won’t take me. I have tried twice. I know the emergency DT signs to look for. I think I am ok for now. 

My question is has anyone else gotten fevers while detoxing? I don’t have a thermometer but I just know when I start getting the chills that’s what it is. Especially when I take some ibuprofen and 45 minutes later I know it’s broke, and I just start sweating. 

I get very nervous when I am sick. I am never sick. Ever. I feel like I’ve done irreparable damage to my body. I’ll definitely get to the ER if things start to get worse. But in the condition I’m in right now, they just won’t take me. I’m not “sick” enough. 

This sucks and I never want to drink again. I have some wine in the fridge just in case I need to take a few sips as not to get too sick. But the thought of having to do that pisses me off. I know going cold turkey is bad but like I said I have medication. Also I have plenty of my bp meds (wonder why I have such high bp 🙄) I’m drinking tons of water and Gatorade as well. 

But yeah, anyone else get low grade fevers while detoxing? And please try not to scare me too much. I’m already a wreck here. ",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Won’t be forgetting tonight. Ever. I’ve had problems drinking forever.  I always allow it to seduce me into thinking “I’ve got control this time.”  My problem is I don’t have an off switch.  Where most people can stop at a beer or two, I want a case.   

I did not get black out drunk tonight.  I wasn’t mean.  I wasn’t bitchy.  That didn’t stop my husband from comparing me to his abusive alcoholic father though.  

I’m young &amp; find that pre-kids people my age all want to have drinks out or have parties with.  

In the past, I’ve become black out drunk &amp; I’ve said very out of character hurtful things.  I once threw a shoe &amp; a phone towards my husband in an argument.  

Tonight we went out with friends for dinner and prior to going out I had had three beers between 12 - 6.   At dinner I had two margaritas.  

When we got home my husband and I argued about something unrelated to my drinking and he said the following “I hate it when you drink because it reminds me of my father.”  (Backstory: his father was an abusive POS who drank and did heavy drugs and left the family when husband was 6.) 

That really hurt.  I haven’t been black out drunk in a long time.  I wasn’t tonight.  I do feel I’ve been in more control.  I certainly don’t think it was a fair comparison.  

I get that he wants me to quit drinking but being cruel like that wasn’t the way.  That really hurt.  

He says he thinks of the shoe incident anytime I am drinking and it makes him not want me to drink.  I truly get that.  I don’t think he handled this correctly though.

"My doctor violated medical confidentiality I needed to send a medical report to a disability rights organization I joined some years ago. I told my neurologist I was enquiring about disability rights and that my general practicioner is and will not be informed about any of this. How my psychologist and psychiatrist are responsible for my treatment. He was the only doctor who knew of my autism and PTSD diagnoses. I told him I had a deadline. For weeks, I made appointment after appointment and call after call, because he wouldn’t write the report he agreed to write.


He now not only sent my GP a copy. He addressed the report to him and I was the one merely getting a copy. A report that is highly confidential and was written to be send to a court of law by me and me alone. It starts of with “Presuming you are familiar with the following diagnoses and treatments of your patient...” .  

He was not available to personally speak to me today, but his practice confirmed in front of a witness that I never signed a release clause with them, which is irrelevant anyway, as I verbally withdrew consent.

My first step was damage control. I showed up at the GP 10 minutes before they opened up, after a sleepless night. When I explained the situation to them, the nice lady working there immediately informed the GP and handed me the original report. My diagnoses and treatments were highlighted with a marker by my GP.  He read the entire report. I am not someone who cries easily, but I had been feeing very sick all morning and outside the practice, I just started bawling. I still feel completely powerless and violated. Drained.

I am writing a report to the state medical board. I was also adviced by multiple people to get the police involved, as these seem be two reportable crimes in my jurisdiction. And no, I don’t live in the US. 

The sad part is that I only told him of my diagnoses because he claimed I “seemed heavily depressed” and that “his intuition” is never wrong. That I “must be suicidal”. I’m not. He said I need therapy. I told him I am already getting it. When he asked what for, I told him autism. And I think that he was very embarrassed there for a moment. He started stuttering and said that my “autistic body language” must have thrown him off.

To add insult to injury, the report itself also includes many mistakes and omits important details and won’t be very useful for the court. 

I know this is bad for my health, bad for my recovery. Every other patient would feel violated now. But I feel like a little child again. Every single time I ask a professional for help, it backfires horribly in some form. I rarely ask any longer and I end up regretting it every time. ",ptsd,ptsd

"Had the biggest meltdown last night that I've ever had. I screamed very loudly. I'm sure the whole neighborhood heard me. I'm so embarrassed I could die. The management at my apartment complex is stressing me beyond what I can handle, and I don't know what to do. I complained that my neighbors' off leash dog tried to run up to my dog-fearful dog, and when I told her the dog needed to be on a leash, which is the rule stated in our lease, and the law where we live, she told me she wouldn't, and that I should call the police when I told her it's the law. Then she aggressively demanded to know  where I lived, so I became afraid that she would mess with me. 

Instead of helping me, management told me I was pet-sitting an unregistered dog, which wasn't true. We had put this dog on our application, and he is on our lease documents, and they have his vet records, but he had to go live at my in-laws, because of all of the unleashed dogs, even tho I had specifically asked about enforcement when we toured, and we were promised that they do. So yes, this dog was visiting because my in-laws went on vacation for a week, because that was the deal for agreeing to take care of my dog for me, so that I didn't have to completely re-home him, but he is registered, and they have his vaccination records. We're hoping not to have to stay here longer than a year. 

Even though all of the office staff knew the whole story, they kept the narrative that I had broken the rules, and sent a letter to our whole building, ""reminding"" everyone of the rules, including the ""no pet sitting,"" so that the lady whom I asked to follow the rules now believed that I was breaking them too, so I don't suppose she will be very nice, especially since they're still not using a leash, which doesn't matter to me now, since my in-laws are back. 

During one of the phone calls I had with management, when they weren't being very nice, I had a seizure. I dropped my phone and couldn't pick it back up. Then I had another one the next day, when I tried  to talk to them face to face. My brain just literally shuts down. 

Now suddenly they need to check the strap on my water heater, the very next day? I think they want to find evidence of me breaking some rule, so they can get rid of me, because they don't like that I make calm and rational arguments, and they have to be careful because of my protected status, and they know they can't do anything about the jerk neighbor. I'm afraid they will send me into another seizure, which are terrifying, and might be causing brain damage, because the more I have these seizures the worse my symptoms seem to get. 

The seizures are also humiliating, which is why I'm afraid to go anywhere now. I am trapped in my home, and now the insensitive management is going to come in here, probably while my husband is at work, and I'll have no way to protect myself. I don't see how this is legal, but I'm also poor, so I'm not very important to anyone but my husband, so I don't know what I can do.

"Autistic housemate is very difficult to live with. Need advice on how to resolve the issues we have This is quite the story and I'm not sure where to begin. I moved into a new house with an autistic housemate some months ago. From what I understand, he has been formally diagnosed with autism by a professional. While we do have a lot in common and occasionally have a nice time together, certain negative behaviours of his have come to the surface, possibly exasperated  by a change in the housemate dynamic (old familiar people moved in, new people moved in). I would like help interacting with this housemate as I believe he is an intelligent, sensitive and kind person whose condition is made worse by social pressures to be an ""alpha"" I suppose I'll make a list for context  


1. Asking inappropriate questions - He likes to ask people he barely knows about their romantic and sexual lives mere minutes after meeting them. He asks myself and the housemates about it constantly and if we ask him to stop, he gets upset over his lack of social graces. Whenever someone does actually engage with him about sexual topics, he quickly becomes upset due to his lack of experience in the matter. 
2. As he does not have many friends outside of the house, he tries forcibly to integrate himself into mine and the other housemates social lives, becoming upset and angry when we don't invite him to social events that exist outside of the housemate dynamic. In events involving the housemate group, he is quick to becoming controlling, irritable and dominating usually resulting in a social event becoming awkward and unenjoyable. He is not willing to join social or sports clubs in the local area and prefers to be with housemates. 
3. He suffers from depression and anxiety but does little to treat it due to his distrust of mental health professionals. As such he is prone to high emotions and lashes out at housemates. This has greatly upset members of the house and when professional treatment is advised, he is quick to dismiss it. He is also prone to binge drinking
4. Inability to accept criticism. When I or the other housemates express our frustration with his behaviours, he is quick to defend himself and quicker to dismiss our side of the issue.  This is especially the case with me and our conversations with one another. With women, he makes promises to change his ways but does not do so for any decent length of time
5. (Minor) He gets annoyed when I don't share my food or take up his offers to have his food. I don't know why. Possibly due to previous housemates taking up his offers more than me. I don't know how to stop this from happening. 

Putting this down on a list, it becomes clear that the main problem here is communication. He cannot communicate what he wants us to do for him and we cannot communicate what we want to him either. Any advice on improving communication would be appreciated.",autism,autism

"Concerned I'm developing a dependence... So I have a history of mental health problems (who doesn't!) -Alcoholism runs in my family and has been a major issue for my mother and my grandparents, and also my extended family. 

I remember my mum would be very cautious about my alcohol consumption as a teen/young adult. (I live in the UK, so alcohol is treated differently in the UK than in places like America. It's pretty much accepted that young people in their teens drink/get drunk- and drinking culture is huge here) As it's so normal here for teens to drink, I always wondered why she was so strict with me, but now I understand. 

After a horrible experience at 14 which included a copious amount of alcohol, which put me off it for many, many years, I feel that now in my mid twenties, I have really 'discovered' drinking. 

Over the course of about a year, I've gone from drinking every month or two, to drinking 5/6 nights a week until I fall asleep. 

I am incredibly antisocial, and incredibly depressed, so I tend to drink alone in secret. I also have horrendous sleeping problems which Doctors won't even attempt to treat (sometimes not sleeping for 3 days at a time, sometimes sleeping for 20+ hours, and constantly exhausted) Without going into detail, my mental health issues have been treated by various doctors/therapists/psychologists/psychaitrists/months of hospitalisations (I feel like everyone goes through this shit at some point though so whatever) -but I feel that now there's nothing that can be done for me. I've tried it all. 

I know I'm not an 'alcoholic,' (I feel like people throw that term around far too much) but I do feel like I may be beginning to develop a psychological dependency. I find myself thinking that drinking non-alcoholic liquid is almost kind of pointless (does that make sense?) 

Is this a normal phase that everyone goes through? Is it the beginning of an 'issue?' If anyone has any thoughts or advice that'd be great.

"Grief triggering flashbacks \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*trigger warning\*\* guns/  drunk father/ physical abuse suffocation /  natural peaceful pet loss / narcissistic mother\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  

&amp;#x200B;

I have had PTSD since I was about 7 yrs old.  It took me into my thirties to realize what it was because I couldn't remember the traumatic event and my mother never told me what happened, she just told me I was crazy.  The memory began to surface when I was grieving from miscarriage.   I checked the story with my aunt and she confirmed it.  The memory was that my dad was drunk and threatening to kill me, my sister, my mother, and my mother's fiance with a gun.  I still only remember fragments, but I can tell you it was terrifying to me at that age.

Recently, this is what happened.  

Our beloved cat passed on last week, it was a very peaceful natural death, and last night we were watching a movie called Rachel Getting Married which has some very intense themes.  I had seen it before and there was a scene where a woman confronts her mother and they get into a physical fight. The mother reminds me of mine.

 I started having a flashback of waking up screaming some time after the trauma with my father and doing this on a regular basis as a little kid.  My mother's solution was to come in, slap my face, scream at me, and finally cover my mouth and sit on me to the point I felt like I was suffocating.  I honestly think if she could get away with it, she would have smothered me to death.  I think I was an embarrassment to her.  She has narcissistic traits.  I vaguely remembered this before this flashback, but it always seemed muted, gauzy, and far away.

Any way, last night I had this flashback in the living room right where our kitty passed.  Weird.  I start to wonder if going through the grieving process can leave someone with their guard down and some of these memories come up.  

I am doing ok, but still horrified at my mom.  We have been no contact for about a year for other reasons.  This just confirms for me how toxic the environment growing up was.  Thanks for listening.  Telling my story really helps.",ptsd,ptsd

What happens to me is I get really hyped about a subject for weeks and it could last more than that. 

For example I used to be really interested in programming and after weeks of researching I bought a book on it, read a few chapters and it didnt interest me as much anymore. 
Same thing happened to focusing on ***science***, ***art***, ***writing***, ***music***, etc...
Now when this happens I get really depressed because I know that it won't last forever, is this an ADHD thing or a general thing?

"PTSD since 1976 Hi, all 
I'm new here. I've been suffering from PTSD since 1976. Some days are good, but most really suck. Without going into detail I'll just say my PTSD is combat related, although we were not in a ""declared"" war at the time. Not Vietnam, BTW. It took the VA and social security until 2014 to finally recognize my problems.
I suffer nightmares almost every night and only get about 4 hours of sleep. 
Writing fiction has become a release for me. 
My current wife, my first wife passed away, is supportive, but doesn't really understand why I have so many bad days. She doesn't understand why we sit in the back of a restaurant and I always have to face the door. 
She doesn't like when I drink but she knows it keeps the monsters (memories) at bay - flashbacks are less frequent when I've had a few adult beverages. 
She also doesn't understand the mood swings and the anger that sometimes wells up. I try to warn her that this is not a good time for a discussion and it pisses her off. There are no support systems for families where I live - the Philippines  - so she just puts puts up with my bs.  
Damn, I'm rambling now. 
Anyway, I look forward to reading posts here about how people cope with their monsters. 
Sorry for the rambling, but it's been one of the bad days. 
BTW, I never physically abuse my wife but I can get loud sometimes and I know that can be just as bad. She loves me and puts up with my shit. 
I sold all my weapons but there are days when I wish I hadn't. 
Oh, and I was in counseling for a year. Useless. I take no drugs,  like xanax or any of that shit but beer, brandy,  and gin are great pacifiers. ",ptsd,ptsd

"Recovering is scary I'm not sure if I need to add a content warning but here goes. Also not sure if this needs a flair srry

So I've struggled with maintaining healthy eating habifor a while now, I went to the doctor recently with my close friend (for moral support, my primary care givers are anti medicine and refuse to acknowledge my health issues) and got told that while yes I have unfortunately an ED, they cannot exactly point to what it is and will need extra testing. They only ruled out a few possibilities so far. I got a referral to a center that focuses more on these issues. Needless to say I am absolutely terrified.

Is there anything I should be prepared for when I'm being tested or when I get treatment for whatever it is I have. How do I hide all this from my caregivers (who I know will just say I'm looking for attention and am vaccine injured or something even though its visibly affecting my physical health). What is the average cost of medicines, if any are even prescribed? I have so many questions and not enough answers 

BTW for context: I'm a 17 year old girl so while I can go to appointments by myself its for the most part recommended to have a trusted individual like a friend or parent come with, I guess for moral support or something.

"Diagnosed ADHD-PI. Mom of a toddler. Unmedicated by choice. I need help finding motivation to take care of myself in the food/exercise dept. Story in comments. Any thoughts? Food dept. I do ok during the day, but after dinner I basically start eating. Chocolate, crisps, cheese on toast, you name it.

I quit smoking 1.5 weeks ago and that certainly did not help regarding my diet, because now I'm trying to fill up the hole smoking left.

I have no motivation. I'm always tired, and after a day of baby rearing (or working and commuting), cooking, cleanup, all I feel like is just vegetating in front of the TV until it's way past the bedtime that would be good for me.

And I hate it. HATE it. I hate that I take such shit care of myself. 

I keep trying to get on track, every day I start anew, but then the evening comes around and I'm like, eh fuck it, I'm buying myself that bag of Maltesers for after dinner. Oh, tonight I'm gonna do yoga and I'm gonna do it every night to get back in shape! (Does one session of yoga and that's it for like 3 weeks.)

Becoming a mom had a massive impact on my well-being, and it took me over a year to (sort of) come out of that. Got myself a nice anxiety disorder as an added bonus. I'm trying to work on that with meditation but even though I've noticed it really helps me I can't even do that for myself daily. I'm talking about 10 minutes a day. Ugh. 

I have no backbone, I have no willpower, and I want to change. I am even seriously considering going on meds (even though I have done without for over 32 years, diagnosed at 28, and I don't really want to bc I'm scared of it), just to see if that will give me the boost to take better care of myself.

"Depressed 16-year-old aspie, extremely dysfunctional family. Is there no hope left for my life? (very long) Hi, I'm a 16-year-old with Aspergers, and my family is killing me on the inside. Apologies in advance for the very long post, and I understand if you don't want to read it all. Firstly, *some background information*:

Four kids, age gap as large as 10 years; youngest is 6, oldest is me at 16. In the middle are a 9-year-old and 14-year-old. My primary autistic issue (most strongly affecting me on a day-to-day basis) is SPD, *especially* sound. All of my siblings also seem to have some form of high-functioning autism, however none of them appear to be affected by any sort of SPD whatsoever.

Much younger, up until around 10, I was enrolled in public school. Various issues (I'd prefer to not go into detail) resulted in me eventually becoming homeschooled, as well as my other sibling who was 8 at the time. After this point, none of my other siblings ever touched public school at any point, and were only homeschooled. Things weren't going *too* bad at this point.

**This brings us to present day.**

My parents eventually, slowly over time, did less and less traditional homeschooling, until it was completely dropped. Unconsciously resulting in me, also unconsciously, trying to unschool myself (I had no idea what it was until recently). So as of right now, all of us simply wake up... then do whatever, until we sleep and repeat. No obligations whatsoever.

Now for me personally, this is great, as I'm trying to actively put in a huge amount of effort to learn and develop useful skills everyday. With this kind of free time, and tests etc. not taking up my brain, I could master something in a fraction of the time it would take others, and I'm trying to take full advantage of that and be productive (instead of doing things like playing video games constantly).

**However, this is also where big problems come into play.**

What do my siblings do all day? The 2 middle siblings: they play video games, and they watch YouTube. I shit you not, that's *quite literally* all they do. Wake up, eat, video games, YouTube, eat, video games, YouTube... sleep. Repeat, every day, for the past ~20 months or so. As for the youngest (6), he acts more like a 4-year-old. He gets what he wants a lot of the time, because when he doesn't (or he faces a minor inconvenience on a phone game or something), he screams and cries as loud as possible. My mother is quite fond of ""he's just a baby"" and ""there's nothing we can do about it, we can't control him.""

I've tried talking to my siblings. ""What are you going to do when you're an adult?"", a simple ""I don't know"" is usually all I can get out of them. They show zero desire to be productive or even try to learn any skills (they mostly just have knowledge of YouTubers or games they play), no amount of suggestion or incentive has helped at all. But they somehow show unlimited desire to rage at games, and then stomp around the fucking house because they're mad. They also like to ""play,"" where ""playing"" is running around everywhere with toys, while yelling random crap at eachother as loud as they can and laughing their asses off as they jump and run super quickly into walls like chimpanzees. I get the same ""I can't control them"" and ""kids need to play, *that's their job*!"" responses from my mother when I ask them to be quieter or stop when they're ""playing."" Keep in mind I am talking not only about the 6-year-old, but the 9 and 14-year-olds do this too. Often when they're not ""playing,"" they're instigating some response out of the 6-year-old that will make him scream, or screaming themselves about something he does.

I have continually and consistently drilled into my entire family's heads the fact that I am very sensitive to noise, vibrations, thumps... to no avail. My parents are completely aware that I have Aspergers, they just refuse to put effort into any sort of accommodation that isn't so easy and effortless it could be done and over with in 2 minutes. Dare I ever complain about noise, *I'm the one who gets told to ""shut up,""* while everyone else continues to be as loud and annoying as they like. Their ""normal talking"" voices I'm pretty damn sure are at least 10-20% louder than an actual normal human being's talking volume. Even the most casual of conversation is at least a half-yell that can be heard across the entire 2-floor house, and dear God when they angrily start actually yelling back and forth at eachother, I genuinely want to fucking die or at least have my ears chopped off. When they leave or enter a room (which is pretty often) they either slam it so hard it shakes the whole house or they leave it open (despite VERY consistent and long-term attempts at asking them to just keep their doors closed), and then proceed to be loud from inside the room. When they are watching a movie or ""adult"" TV show (at least once a day), they put the SUBWOOFER really loud, and almost every time I have to ask them to turn it down a lot. They say they ""turn it down"" but even then I'm usually still getting intermittently assaulted by intense vibrations in my entire body until 1-2 hours later.

I go upstairs, close the door, and put on my thick headphones that are supposed to block noise, which I purchased myself earlier this year. I turn on some music, and if I'm really lucky they'll be quiet enough that I have 20-30 minutes of peace at a time. On average (and yes I have actually documented interrputions at one point) there is some loud noise (passes through medium-volume music in big headphones) every 11 minutes of the day, and that's not counting things like subwoofer. I don't count this either but they also intermittently ""check on me,"" whether that's walking by and yelling very loud ""Hello imscrewed69"" and getting extremely annoyed if I don't answer back (yes I've asked them not to do this several times), or by sneaking up and opening the door as fast as they can look at my screen and say ""what are you doing?"" I don't even have a history of hiding things, but to be honest I'm really quite scared of them finding some mundane things:

**Not allowed.**

I have some friends I play video games with and I can't talk to them with my voice at all unless it's an occasional whisper, because last time I tried that (years ago) I was FORCED to remove every single person from my Steam friends list permanently while I cried my eyes out, and I'm still really pissed since I haven't found them since :(. So I basically only have a few super secret internet friends, I don't know a single person outside of family in real life. If they found this post (I've fuzzed a few specifics/minor details) I would be in some deep shit. Keep in mind EVERYTHING I am saying here is either 100% truth or at most very slightly exaggerated. I have to put up a squeaky-clean facade.I act like I don't know anything that's currently going on in the world. I wouldn't be allowed to ready *any* form of regular news, see anything with any sort of sexual undertones, sexual references, or swear words. *I didn't even own a phone* until very recently, they got one for me only to be used to call them if they are out of the house. I STILL don't have an e-mail (that they know of), I'm not allowed and if they ""let"" me have one they would monitor it closely. They genuinely think I don't know about any of that stuff and I'm fucking scared what would happen if they found out.

**My parents and family don't physically hurt me or eachother. But I can't say the same for the mental/psychological side, intentional or not.**

I try to ""just do it."" I try to work through the absolute insanity I'm exposed to everyday. I've tried to ""just ignore it"" (one of my mother's favorites) time and time again, it DOESN'T WORK. Every time I feel the slightest bit of motivation, feel energy in myself because I want to learn something or get something done... it gets instantly crushed when I remember the fact that most likely 5-10 minutes into working there's gonna be a 10-minute yelling fight or something. I dare try to ignore that thought and, 9 times out of 10, it ends up happening anyway and all the energy is sucked away. My mind goes blank. It becomes an empty void. I can't think straight. I can only feel some kind of intense mental, almost physical but not quite, *pain*. My body is telling me to not subject myself to inevitable the sharp pain and sudden spike of intense fear and adrenaline, of slowly slipping into focus only to be metaphorically shoved off a cliff when someone throws a giant toy at the fucking wall. I've put all of my projects off. I can get some work done but in very short bursts, in very small parts of the day. Usually when I just get lucky and manage to scrounge up enough effort to get started and for once it doesn't come crashing down in the first 10 minutes. When my parents and youngest (or better yet, all of them) are gone to the store or something, and they leave me alone, I experience a high, a pleasurable feeling like no other, it feels like the very essence of *freedom*. Where I'm able slip into true focus and get so much done it's not even funny. I finally don't have to feel 1,000 butterflies in my stomach when I dare try to work on something that requires an ounce of focus or brainpower. I finally don't have to crank up loud music long-term ear-damage levels and hope the youngest randomly shrieking at his phone game for no goddamn reason doesn't overpower it. When they're here with me, as batshit insane as ever, the fight-or-flight feeling doesn't want to go away.

**Closing.**

I have skills that I want to learn. I want to dedicate my large amount of """"""""free"""""""" time to them, take advantage of what is *almost* a decent situation. But I just *can't*. Reading about and deliberately practicing something for 10 minutes, and then having it abruptly end to God knows what it could be this time, is extremely harmful to the ability to absorb, process, store, and truly understand the information. Not to mention that I've been conditioned to be constantly on edge, and the fear of interruption taking up precious memory space.

Do I have depression? I really think I might, I put it in the title, I know feeling this way isn't normal. I think a little bit about suicide sometimes but never in detail or plans, or that often, I really don't want to ever do that. Even if I am depressed, my parents would have a field day with another thing to tell me is ""just in my head,"" that I ""have control over"" and about how it's ""NOT OK to be mentally ill."" Even if I took anti-depressants or adhd meds or anything like that (but not in a million years would my parents go down any path resulting in those) I doubt they would have any real, measurable effect on most aspects of the complex situation at hand.

I want to move out. But I'm only 16. I'm just about capable of small-medium freelancing jobs skill-wise, and what I'm trying to do is build new skills and further my current ones through deliberate practice and learning. It will help me be skilled enough to make some money and hopefully finally be able to live by myself. But my situation is stopping me dead in my tracks. I can't move out because I'm 16 and *not quite well-rounded enough yet*, but I can't meaningfully *learn and develop more skill* at a fast enough pace *because of* my shitty situation that I'm trying to escape.

*The end.*

I apologize for the long rant-y wall of text. I've never told anyone about my situation at all, not even the slightest detail. I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish by making this post, I don't know if you can help me, but a sincere thank you for reading.

New here Hi everyone. I’m new to reddit and online help in general so if this post doesn’t belong feel free to remove it no hard feelings. I just wana vent about my least favorite part about living with ptsd that I really hate about myself is my reactions to things or how hyperactive you can be. I hurt my best friend yesterday not realizing there wasn’t any danger. We were playing cards and he reached for the deck really quick by me and I just had so much fear remembering what happened to me and I just started punching. I’ve felt so guilty ever since.

"What does it mean if a girl from out of town acts like this I am in 11th grade and met a girl from another town an hour away. I met her through a distance learning class. Well I didn't notice anything until the first day she met me in person. I was sitting and then they came in as well as the teacher. They visited our school and when the teacher was talking to me she had to say something and butted in then said something and smiled, raised her eyebrows. Then she got to talk to me. When she saw me on the screen she would compliment me a lot. Like she said ""I didn't know you wore glasses"" ""I like your glasses"". Then when I showed a heart sign with my hand she did it back. Then she complimented my shirts too. She doesn't do this to anyone else not even other girls. I added her on fb and she instantly accepted within half an hour. Then we went on a field trip together. When a girl from my class said something to me she butted in from across the room started saying something and smiling. Then on the ride she kept looking back and she would look back 3 times only to look right at me. When I caught her she stopped doing it. Then when I wasn't paying attention she walked by me said ""HI Steve"" and I had to look down bc shes 5'1 and I am 6'1 lol. She walked by said hi and smirked but couldnt look me in the eyes.

"C-PTSD nightmares about abuser being happy now? I spent six months in a relationship with a man who turned out to be a textbook narcissist and verbally chewed me up and spit me out. No physical abuse but threats of it (he was an MMA fighter so... that.) and a master emotional manipulator.

TW, he also sexually assaulted me. I lost the ability to tell him no towards the end.

That was four years ago. I'm now in a very loving relationship, planning a wedding in September and miles and miles away physically and emotionally from that part of my life.

I've had interconnected dreams for the past two weeks that I wake up very upset from even though they're not nightmares. Basically, I go snooping to look up on him and find that he's in what appears to be a now perfect relationship for him. They're happy, not a single sign of distress, it outwardly looks normal. They live together, they're engaged, they've got pets...

Now last night I dreamt a continuation where they got pregnant and had a baby girl. I somehow got access to medical records and the more I read about this healthy, perfect woman and her pregnancy, the more terrified I got. I dreamt I found posts from him on reddit that friends of mine liked (we have no friends in common, so that's a weird thought) and I kept wanting to shout, ""No! This isn't who he actually is!"" -- THAT upsets me in all sorts of ways. I continually ask for understanding that people change, that I've grown and it feels disingenuous to not give him the same courtesy, even in my weird sleeping brain fantasy.

Last time I snooped irl (this was 5 months after it ended), I found out he was doing what he did to me to a new girl (there were 3 before me and then one after me... The pattern was there). I make it a point now not to look because I know this is just my brain searching for a reason, an A-HA moment that puts all the pieces together so I can reconcile what happened.

When I have these dreams, I wake up sick to my stomach that he's normal and living a seemingly gentle, domesticated life. Does this sound familiar for anyone? Do you wake up distressed from non-distressing subjects?",ptsd,ptsd

"Advice needed on child with Autism and puberty My 10 year old son has high-functioning Autism. He is incredibly intelligent however, he still has trouble grasping social situations and being social in general. He is well liked at school, but he doesn't understand why. He never shows any interest in maintaining friendships outside of school with other children. 

He misbehaved at school the other day, as follow through at home, he had to hand over his tablet. After he did, I went through his internet browser search history. I check the history on a bi-weekly basis, as he's never given me pause to check more. This time, I found that he's been visiting Pornhub and watching Fortnite related porn.

"Alcohol is killing my mother I'm sixteen and my mother is forty-eight.

She's been a hardcore alcoholic since before I was born (she didn't drink during the pregnancy, obviously). My entire childhood I had to deal with her drunken rampages and then the hangovers that made her shut herself in her room and refuse to care for us. Hell, it was my big sister who got me up and cooked for me every day since she was nine. I probably wouldn't have made it to school most days without her.

About seven months ago my Mom's completely disgusting personality coupled with her addiction FINALLY got her kicked out of the house. Thanks, CPS.

Please don't get me wrong, it's a sad situation, but I've been praying for her to be removed for the longest time. I even went to CPS when I was eleven and she told them I was crazy (I'm still angry that they believed her then).

Mom's now been living with her parents in colorado for seven months, chugging whiskey and smoking all day every day. She won't get a job, she won't leave the house. Her dad is an alcoholic as well and her stepmom is too polite to tell her to get a fucking grip.

They had to take her to the hospital a few days ago because she was stumbling around and rambling like she was drunk, but she was actually sober. There was no alcohol in her blood. Mom gets sweaty and shaking when she has withdrawls but this was apparently different. She was acting completely demented, like telling her dad to ""feed the chickens"" even though they don't have chickens.

They kept her at the hospital for like three days because they didn't know what the hell was wrong with her.

She already has awful bone problems, skin problems and allergies, and now her brain is literally deteriorating because she won't stop drinking all the time. Her liver must be a useless hunk of meat at this point. 

I've never loved that nasty witch, but she's my mom, and I don't want her to die when I'm a college student. There's no way to make her take care of herself, especially from two states away.

"Need help with 13y/o attitude Ok, I'm going to ask for a little help, which I'm not good at, I'm usually the one giving the help. Also, sometimes I come across the wrong way, so please do not get upset with me if I say the wrong thing. My son is 13, he is listed as high functioning (I think that term is no longer used, but I don't know the new term, but that's what the Dr called it), and a low IQ. He mimics a lot of things but doesn't really understand what's going on. 
Plus, he's deep in puberty, so there is that teenage attitude, you know where he is the only person on earth who's opinion matters, and he's in charge of everyone else. So he comes in mimicking what he's seen on tv, and what he's heard from the other kids at school. He's in a special school for kids with Autism, he's the only white kid in his class, which is no problem except he's coming home from school saying the n-word. I guess the other kids have accepted him and don't care if he says it. But, the thing is he doesn't know any better he will say it in the middle of wal-mart, or the mall, or wherever. That would not be good. 
He will start yelling at us, we are going to do what he says, or we are going to give him what he wants. Or we will get on to him about something minor, and he will bow up on us (throw out his chest and act like he want to fight, for those that don't know), I mean he will across the room and bump up against me, Fist drawn back. I have to make him back down, this isn't a meltdown this is him knowing exactly what he's doing, but I'm not sure if he understands why he shouldn't do this. If we get loud, and push back against him, he'll back down and go to his room. But he will spend 15-30 minutes talking in a growl, talking about how he is going to beat up whoever he got into it with. We can go back there 4 or 5 times before he gets quit. Again I don't understand, how much he understands about right and wrong. About why he shouldn't bow up on people, why he shouldn't yell at people, why he should do what he's told, of course we try to let him be as independent as possible. If he was a NT, I would know how to deal with a 13 y/o I've raised two of those, but not knowing how much he understands, I don't know how to deal with his attitude.  Any help would be appreciated.

"its sad how people treat me after i gained a bunch of weight back lol (tw: suicide and depression mentioned) i lost about 40ish pounds more than a year ago? i went from about 170 lbs all the way down to approx. 132 lbs. it was healthy at first, but then it spiraled down to this obsession and all i could think about at the time was just how fucking huge i was. i counted calories like my life legit depended on it - it was SO bad that if i didnt count for a day, i would get suicidal ideation and horrible panic attacks. but the smaller i got, the more.... nicer people seemed. i cant really explain it. the diet in general helped my skin clear up, my body was toned from all the exercising i did, and my body did look good looking back at some old photos now. i did notice a bit of attention from guys, and people seemed to want to talk to me way more now than when i was 170 lbs. everyone was just much friendlier, but i didnt really truly realize it at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

then i went through  a HORRIBLE depressive episode. all i did was work and go back home with a bunch of food and basically stuffed myself because food was the only thing keeping me alive. acne started to come back, my clothes are so much tighter... even my face ballooned up. i avoided weighing myself or calorie counting because all i wanted to do was stuff my face until my stomach felt like it was about to explode. this went on for two months or so, and well... 25 lbs later, i can say that a lot of things changed. people stopped talking to me less. no compliments or even a bat of an eye towards me. even my own parents started shaming me in wearing clothes i usually wore, even though they would have not said anything if i were 25 pound lighter. im basically invisible again. alone.

i hate that i started counting calories again. i hate how i started thinking about food again. but i also cant handle this sort of treatment. even with body positivity being more relevent now a days, people are STILL pressured into these standards and its so horribly depressing.

"Do any of you suffer from sleep hallucinations? I suffer from hypnopompic sleep hallucinations. They occur during the awakening process, but technically the body is still considered to be asleep. When they occur, I am usually lucid enough to understand that I am in my bedroom and ""awake"", but that's the extent of it. I will often hear voices, see visuals, and most often I will believe that someone is with me in my room. I estimate it takes about 5 minutes or so for me to realize I am awake, and understand that what I've seen isn't real.

Basically what I saw was the floor began to move, which is a normal sight for me. Happens all the time. But then it started spinning and forming a sort of vortex. It almost felt as though I was being pulled in. Then in my peripheral vision, I saw black holes appear on the ceiling. They turned into eyes, and were watching me.

"struggling with creative projects i'm in my 4th year of an art program in college. i was diagnosed back in highschool and have been on/off medication between then (i'm terrible with getting prescription refills which really doesn't help my case haha).

although i've always loved art and creating content, it's been a huge struggle from start up til now in a school setting, mostly thanks to my inability to manage my time and lack of effective school habits. process work and building up my ideas especially have been issues - i often find myself falling into the trap of ""due in 3 months? doesn't exist until then"" when in reality i should be developing my work. i know i've got it in me to do so much better, but as i'm sure you all understand, ADHD makes it difficult to bring that out. medication does help when i have it, but it won't take me far without enforcing good habits (which is, of course, much easier said than done).

this isn't limited to just school, i often start projects or have big ideas that i'm super hype about at first, only to fizzle out not too long after. it's aggravating, especially when i still Want to continue working on whatever project, but if my interest is shut off then i'm shit outta luck.

its hard not to compare myself to my peers, but it can be disheartening seeing them putting out great work, and a ton of it too, whereas i really struggle to keep up.

"I am in trouble Before I start, let me just say that I realize I have a serious problem and I know I will be told to see a doctor.  However I need support too.

I had a severe sleepwalking accident (unrelated to alcohol) last summer. They kept me in a coma for 4 days and I am damn lucky to be alive, bc I sustained a severe traumatic brain injury and had bruising on 80% of my body which led to rhabdomyolysis. In total, I was in the hospital for a week, but before I was released, no one told me about the effects or the recovery after sustaining a brain injury. 

It has been hell. And I have made some poor choices since getting out of the hospital. I am prescribed Klonopin, but am supposed to be tapering my dose as of this month. For a couple of months now, I have been abusing alcohol, phenibut and found a source for extra Klonopin. I am nearing the end of my phenibut taper, which has been tough. But I have stuck with it. However my alcohol use has increased to almost daily and last night, for the first time in years, I blacked out.  And I am still taking far too much Klonopin. This morning when I woke up, I didn't feel hungover, but I noticed my legs felt like they were shaking even though there was no noticeable movement. My anxiety was through the roof.  I had leftover hard liquor from last night and and even though it sounded disgusting, I drank some a bit ago to see if it would curb the symptoms I felt. When it did, I realized I was in BIG trouble.

At this point, I don't know if cold turkey is an option. I feel like I need to see a doctor but my pcp is only available on Tuesdays and Thursdays so getting into him will take weeks. I know I have to face this head on, but inpatient detox isn't an option for me. I live alone with a cat who relies  on me for everything and I don't have a friend I can call and ask to stop in to feed her. If I leave her and go into the hospital, I don't know what will happen to her and she has kidney and stomach issues. I am not trying to use this an as excuse. I know I need help and that I've likely permanently fucked up my GABA receptors. Should I go into a walk in clinic? The ER will keep me there, I am thinking and I don't know how my cat will survive without a caretaker.

Please keep any judgment to yourselves. I am asking for advice... In the last year I moved back to Canada after being gone 17 years bc my father has Lewy body dementia. My ex and I divorced after a 17 year relationship and I don't know what's up or down anymore. I think about suicide all the time but my cat keeps me here. I am sure that sounds pathetic, but it's true.

I don't know what to do. But what I am doing currently is killing me. I need some support and some real talk regarding this and I don't have a support network here in Canada.

Part of me thinks drinking myself to death is the best option. Surely with Klonopin in the mix, it can't be that difficult.

Now I kind of have the issue of getting too much into this (as always when I find a topic that catches my attention, even more so when it applies to me), especially into the concept of ""autistic aloneness"". And that concept makes me sad, and I don't want it to seem so true to me, but it does.  
It's basically that autistic people struggle with really truly connecting with other people because of our issues with being social.  
I have a few friends and close acquaintances, also have had several relationships in the past, currently have a girlfriend/boyfriend who I love dearly and a few friends with benefits-ish humans. So my social skills seem to be rather okay for the most part and I can see that other humans like me and feel connected to me. But sometimes I get this feeling that really I'm not in touch with anyone, not even my partner. This happens especially in moments of great closeness. I feel that I love her, and I feel that there is no issue in our relationship (she's an understanding, supportive and ready to accomodate/adapt person and I also try my best to be) - it's just an issue in myself that I get this feeling of being a singular event of a human.  


The author of the book I'm reading connects autistic aloneness with the ""Theory of Mind"", and applied to autism it apparently means that we are less able to think of other people's minds and thoughts as different from our own and struggle with knowing others' mental states, which can lead to confusion and isolation. For example, struggling with social cues or reading people's feelings.  
And that's how I feel with a lot of humans. I feel like I can't quite get ""into their head"", but rather I'm seperated by a tiny layer of something. This is especially frustrating as human contact and connectedness are very important to me and I crave it. But then those moments happen. I've also considered if this is just depression, dissociation, nihilism or other stuff I've dealt with before, but this feeling of seperation can get me even in moments of complete happiness, where I realise that I'm still this singularity in myself.  


I have no idea if this makes sense to anyone else, but it really resonated with me and made me very sad. Whether or not you relate to the feelings or agree with the concepts, I'd love to hear other people's thoughts or experiences.",autism,autism
"Athletics and drinking Hello,

I’ve Never posted here before but I thought this is the most apt community for my question.

I’ve been a fairly regular drinker over the past ten years since turning 21.  Recently, my wife and I are expecting a Child and we’ve made a ‘pact’ not to drink/take drugs during the pregnancy as kind of an act of solidarity. This worked for times we are together but when we are separated, like this weekend when she’s out of town, I get a “hall pass” to drink beer and go out with my buddies.

Anyways, I’ve noticed throughout my adulthood that when I’ve had a couple, I am much more focused and excel at individual athletics such as golf, bowling, etc. I’ve joked around in the past that I need my ‘aiming fluid’ in a shitty round of golf but alcohol really does help in these situations.  It seems to focus me in on my task and reduces performance anxiety.

I’m wondering if anyone has similar experiences and, if so, is there a way to mimic the calming effects of alcohol in these situations without drinking?  I’m sure practicing sober is the only real way to get better at a task or sport, but any advice from this community would be greatly appreciated.  I went out drinking then bowling last night with the boys and rolled a 145. The previous weekend I barely rolled a 100 when sober so I still feel there is something up with me when It comes to skilled tasks and drinking.

I understand this community is probably not the most appropriate place to ask such questions but I feel, from reading your posts, at least a couple of you all have been in similar situations.  Thanks in advance!",alcoholism,alcoholism

"My trauma (possible triggers, abandonment, drowning) When I was 15 years old my dad was killed in a boating accident along with two of his friends. They were missing for 6 days before their bodies were found. I was the last person to know. Even strangers knew before I did, as it had made the news, but my mom told everyone to keep me away from TV’s, so that I wouldn’t find out that way. It was the day after they were found that my moms best friend came and told me. In the months after this my mom abandoned me, she took off to live in the cabin we had, the last place she saw my dad alive. I was essentially alone in our house for 5 months, having to bike to the store to get food, relying on my friends to be there for me, but I didn’t want to burden them with my problems. 
For the next year I bounced around because my mom sold our family home, the one I grew up in, and I had only a few days notice that it was happening. I was angry and felt I could not depend on anyone, or trust anyone. My mom destroyed my ability to feel like I could depend on anyone. How could I? I needed her and she left me. 
It has been 25 years this year on June 18th, and I have NEVER told her what that did to me. I also don’t feel like I can, because his death traumatized her more than me. She’s still stuck in a denial faze, and has been abusing/using chemicals of some form since the day he went missing. I don’t know how to move past this without telling her, but I can’t tell her because I do believe it would kill her knowing she caused me this much trauma.",ptsd,ptsd

"Anyone working in the medical field while on meds for ADHD willing to share their experience? In undergrad I was diagnosed and treated for ADHD. It wasn't severe, but I was definitely better being treated than not. Since graduating, I moved away and haven't seen a doctor to continue treatment. I'm currently at home and just volunteering at a hospital. Anyway, I got into a masters program and will eventually work as an allied health professional. I'm considering whether or not I should seek treatment again as I start school and eventually become employed, but am hesitant because I'm unable to find reliable information surrounding the experiences of people in these fields who are on controlled medications.

"I'm starting to have issues at work. I work from home! Plush job, right? Well, it's a call center. The issue is, not only do I have crippling social anxiety, but a bad case of sciatica.

So, even if I wanted to work outside of my home again, I can't do a stand up job. That leaves receptionist or more call centers.

I've survived working in call centers for 6 years of my life. I have no soul left. Customer service and sales has sapped every bit of my soul out.

I don't want to go outside anymore. I don't want to interact with people. Accept the ones I know and trust. Every time I leave my house something bad happens. So my brain tells me to stay inside.

I know this isn't healthy. So I force myself to go shopping, things like that. But every time I think about working around people my hands start to shake. I worked as a cashier, the first time $20 EVER went missing from my register the manager pulled me into the office and told me ""we're going to go through this footage together. And when I see you taking money out of my register, I'm going to call the cops and have them arrest you."" Turns out another manager took the bill and stuck it into a different register for NO APPARENT REASON!!!

That's just one of a million nightmare scenerios that have honestly lead me from being a brave confident girl, to a nervous wreck in her late 20s.

So now, every morning my hands are shaking as I log in. The job isn't hard. People are my trigger. I don't want to be around them. I get that no matter what, my job will require some human contact. I get it. But I need something I can do before I lose it. I don't have time to get a degree, freelance jobs are not going to replace my 40 hour income. I've been searching for something to do for 2 years and I've run out of ideas. I can do light physical work. But anything that resembles a normal standing shift cripples me.

I'm an artist. I wish I could get a job making art. Or I wish I could learn how to run a tshirt business. But I need something soon. I'm waiting for a counseling appointment coming soon, but I'd like to solve as much of this issue on my own as I can.

"My mother says something offputting every day only towards me despite changing variables Wednesday November 28th.


Necessary backstory: my parents have custody of my oldest sisters children. Theres only 2, 8 and 2 years old. The 2 year old his dad earned his rights back but my 61 year old mother still will say yes to caring for the kid even after she for example.. had carpal tunnel surgery and had the baby over and gave me work all day for no real reason. Anyway

I arrive home from my caregiver job at about 2 10 pm. Trying to grab food before my 3pm. Firsts she asks if I can watch the baby while she gets my nephew at 3. I said no, i have a client every week day at 3. I say this because she creates her own negative opinion of why I do things unless I comment. Making a sandwich and the whole bag ripped at the seam upon my initial approach. Told my mom. When she said ""oh can you watch the baby 15 minutes so I can switch the bread at kroger"" I'm just like.. what no? I have to go soon I dont have the time to wait on someone. She walks away and says ""okay nobody talk to me today I am having a good day"" very passive aggressively. I told her to start with not talking to me and for good reason at this point.

This is my life every day within moments of coming home. I am a problem just because I didnt bend over backwards. I plan on posting at least once a week to further comment on the things she is doing.

"How long until I can sleep normally? Been drinking nearly daily for around 8 years.  At some point it became equally about enjoying the drunk state as it was about I just could not fall asleep without drinking.  And I mean like a fifth of whiskey just to get a good night sleep.  I was able to handle that for a while but recently, maybe because I'm getting older, that sleep just does not cut it for me anymore and I need like 14 hours of sleep a night to feel refreshed.  

I've been trying to quit for 2 months now, I went 2 weeks last month, but went back to the booze because I legit hadn't had more than 6 or 7 hours of sleep the entire two weeks.  I toss and turn, sweat buckets, feel hot and cold at the same time, etc.  Not to mention the other withdrawal symptoms.

So I like I said I went back after the first 2 weeks of last month but managed to drink only every other day.  I'm trying again now but it's so miserable.  I drank a fifth on Sunday evening, slept ok, got up Monday morning and had 3 beers to try to taper down a bit, and those were my last drinks.  But again, haven't had solid sleep at all since then, and actually I'm having withdrawal symptoms I haven't ever had before.

"Fasting and Schizophrenia What have your experiences with fasting and schizophrenia?

I've been looking at the literature and trying to square that with the actual experiences that people are having but am hearing conflicting stories.

According to this [study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/542b/4954547b280b2a12dcc3d0fa4525952cbda4.pdf), which seem more like an informal study, 70% patients (thousands) that were fasted for extended periods of time ( around 27 days ) and that further maintained monthly fasts of 3 to 5 days reported improvements in their condition. Further more 47% of these patients reported to have ""maintained their improvement"" over a six year period.

Modern experiments in a Keto diet seem to support fasting as a potentially effective treatment option as evidenced in this [case study](http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920996419301136?via%3Dihub). (While an active area of research, we believe that the benefits of fasting and keto reside in using fat rather than glucose the predominant energy source). This case study details 5 cases where the patients experienced severe schizophrenic symptoms that failed to be treated using traditional medicine found that they were able to experience complete remission of symptoms and regain independence when they committed a Ketogenic Diet.

However, the consensus in this  [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/5ho98i/does_not_eating_make_symptoms_worse/) on reddit seems to be the exact opposite at least in the case of failing to eat. One possible explanation is that people that naturally start skipping meals without deliberate attempt to start fasting when their psychosis is especially severe. So the relation is actually that severe psychosis causes you to start fasting as a compensatory mechanism rather than the other way around.

"Stress is the keyword I always thought about my problem as an anxiety disorder or an obsessive disorder, but something didn't fit.

Reading through the book 'Principles' by Ray Dalio, in the chapter where he talks about the mind I found d this (page 220):

'That damned amygdala, which is a little almond-shaped structure that lies deeply embedded in the cerebrum, is one of the most powerful parts of your brain. It controls your behavior, even though you’re not conscious of it. How does it work? When something upsets us—and that something could be a sound, a sight, or just a gut feeling—the amygdala sends notice to our bodies to prepare to fight or flee: the heartbeat speeds up, the blood pressure rises, and breathing quickens. During an argument, you’ll often notice a physical response similar to how you react to fear (for instance, rapid heartbeats and tensing muscles). Recognizing that, your conscious mind (which resides in the prefrontal cortex) can refuse to obey its instructions. Typically, these amygdala hijackings come on fast and dissipate quickly, except in rare cases, such as when a person develops post-traumatic stress disorder from a particularly horrible event or series of events. Knowing how these hijackings work, you know that if you allow yourself to react spontaneously, you will be prone to overreact. You can also comfort yourself with the knowledge that whatever psychological pain you are experiencing will go away before very long.'

This is exactly how I feel a lot, 'hijacked'.

I can not related it with another feeling but with stress. 

The 'fight or flight' feeling. Sometimes I feel a lot of fear, and sometimes I am confrontational to an irrational level.

I was badly hurt physically when I was very young, which led to some physical growth problems. Since then I really didn't understand why I could be so stressed all the time. I'm glad this group exists, and I'm glad there is a way out.

I've used cannabis with FANTASTIC results to treat them for over five years, with long breaks here and there for various reasons. I take two to three tokes before bed and sleep without waking up in fear and disgust, or feeling disturbed the entire next day. It's fantastic.

"Negative diagnosis for ADD/ADHD -- I don't agree. So, after years of holding off, forgetting, convincing myself otherwise I finally scheduled myself to get tested for ADD/ADHD. I've suspected I had it for a while, I check pretty much all the boxes, my mother honestly seems like she has it as well and so on. However, according to the diagnosis my grades aren't bad enough, I did too well on the test, checked too highly on the answer sheet, and was able to sit through the entire session without asking for a break, besides bathroom ones. 


It just doesn't make sense to me. It seems like there's no way I could've got a positive diagnosis unless I was either jumping off the walls or literally zoning out the entire time. Yeah, I get B's and C's, but why does that invalidate my account of consistent procrastination and the fact that i've been in school 8 years already?? Yeah, I did well on the test I guess....sorry i'm smart (I did average on working memory so that's the only one that threw me off)?? I checked too highly on the questionnaire....I guess my honest answers were ""too"" honest?? And I guess I fucked myself over by ""focusing"" too mcuh during the assessments

IDK, i'm just pissed over the diagnosis. I don't feel like the results of the assessment accurately reflect what I shared. We went over everything, she basically reaffirmed that i'm constantly late, forgetful, fidgety, spacey, and so forth but because the results don't add up, screw the rest. And to make it worst, the suggestions pretty much amounted to drink less (I hardly drink), smoke less (only started smoking a couple years ago and I shared that the issues go back to childhood), and ""try harder"" through....you guessed it -- time management/study techniques. I just feel like I was basically told to stop being lazy and doing stupid stuff and you wouldn't have any problems. I've had to deal with people telling me to ""try harder"" my entire life, and to get it from a formal diagnosis did sting a bit, not gonna lie. I just wanted some validation I guess.....

So, any recommendations? I think I have an optional followup appointment, but I don't know if it'd do any good? Should I go somewhere else? Has anybody else had a diagnosis they didn't agree with??

"can't cope. TW: miscarriage

I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2017 due to an abusive relationship that ended in 2015. Despite an occasional depressive episode, I was mostly ""rehabilitated,"" that is, my PTSD symptoms were gone but generalized anxiety remained. In June, I found out I was pregnant. My current partner and I were so excited, even though the prospect of becoming a parent gave me a lot of anxiety (the hormones didn't help). 

Unfortunately, my pregnancy ended in miscarriage in July. Now, PTSD is back in full force. I am having panic attacks for the first time since 2017. I can't sleep. I cry every single day. I have meltdowns about small things. I have to force myself to shower and go to work and eat. I think I'm about to get my first period since having the miscarriage, the cramping is causing flashbacks which send me spiraling. I never liked to drink but I find myself looking for wine everywhere.  I purposefully dissociate so I don't have to deal with real life. I owe hundreds of dollars in medical bills due to my miscarriage and I can't afford a therapist.

It feels so fucking unfair. I felt hope for the first time this year, that I could move past my PTSD and live a happy, fulfilling life. Now that hope is gone and it was replaced with grief, anger, confusion, and anxiety. I don't know how to cope with this. I feel such a strong urge to be self destructive.",ptsd,ptsd

"ADHD AND ANGER? I’ve been experiencing this side of myself for a VERY long time and I was hoping someone out there could relate so I don’t feel so alone in feeling like this. And also so I can maybe feel better about this potentially being an ADHD side effect and not something else.

For as long as I can remember I’ve always felt this overwhelming feeling of anger and irritability around certain things. Usually this feeling occurs when things aren’t going according to planned, according to schedule or things are out of place in some way. At work for example, im a prep cook and my days are pretty much based off of a set course of action, if things are thrown off in any way or I’m pulled to a completely different task I get VERY overwhelmed VERY quickly and that turns into anger and an inability to retain information/focus. It’s almost like I black out for a second and my memory is shit and I can’t pay attention to anything in front of me AT ALL.
I’m not talking like feeling heated for a moment, I’m talking full blown anger to where I have to leave the room and either wait it out for 10 minutes or so or sometimes it gets so bad I leave the room and cry or feel the overwhelming the need to punch a wall.

Is this part of the ADHD experience or am I just completely nuts?

I need as much help with this as possible, so any advice or words are greatly appreciated and encouraged.",adhd,adhd

"Can problem drinkers return to drinking in moderation? My partner was a problem drinker for about 5 years and slowly cut down and then went cold turkey when he saw how it was affecting our relationship. It's been about three months and he hasn't had a drink - our relationship feels stronger than ever and he says he made the right decision for our relationship and that he was ready to move on from that phase of his life.

I looked up the definitions for ""problem drinker"" vs. ""alcoholic"" and I do feel that he fits into the problem drinker category, based on how he was able to cut down &amp; stop drinking on his own without medical intervention/AA and how well it's gone.

I do know he has said that he would like to give drinking a break, let his body reset, and then introduce drinking back into his life in a more ""normal"" way. He thinks that he has the control and ability to do that, but it makes me very nervous that things might go back to the way they were, or escalate.

"My brother has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. What can I do? I’m 32, my brother is 22. We have never been very close, due to our age gap and never living in the same house as my parents separated. But we have always kept in touch and seen each other when I was in town. My family is extremely dysfunctional, to add some context.

Sadly he moved in with my narcissistic alcoholic father when he was 15, and since then has been down the wrong path. The last few years he has not worked, smoked marijuana daily and hung around complete losers while my father did nothing about it. His anxiety increased, and he has distanced himself from all of our family members.

1 year ago he was admitted to hospital with delusions while he was at my mums (escaping problems with my dad I believe), and spent 6 weeks there. Diagnosed with ‘drug induced psychosis’. On discharge went back to my father’s and has been doing nothing much, apparently not taking drugs but who knows.

6 weeks ago he was readmitted and spent 3 weeks there, and was discharged again, not sure where he went. And I just heard from my mum this weekend that he was admitted a 3rd time and discharged again. Mum got a call from the hospital nurse letting her know he had been admitted but was now discharged. It was the first she had heard of it.

My brother has never taken a call from me when in hospital, and never answers his mobile when I try to contact him. He refuses to speak to mum. I don’t know what his relationship with my dad is like, they fight a lot, but I think he goes back there because it’s easy for him.


My mother is losing her mind as she can’t do anything. He won’t talk to her. She can’t get updates from my dad. The hospital doesn’t involve her constantly. She is worried about what is going to happen to him because the hospital just keeps discharging him without any housing and he goes back to dads. No idea if they have started any antipsychotics the third time - the first they didn’t, the second they started oral only, and we didn’t get any info about the third admission,

I read somewhere that most people with schizophrenia reject their families. Is this true? What can we do?

I told her we need to just be calm, consistent and safe, and not have our own dramas and emotions be something he has to deal with. Is there anything more we can do?",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"What's in his best interest? I got married and and am now separated to someone who is currently in a psych hospital. I don't know all the details, but I do know he's being forced to take anti-psychotics.

I had to escape the relationship after a lot of emotional abuse and turbulance. I originally thought he had Narcissistic Personality Disorder, but I am hearing now that they are almost certain he is having schizophrenia symptoms. His friends and family are fearing for his life. Some of them have updated me on recent events. 

During the breakup he lied incessantly and said a ton of deplorable things about me to his friends to cover up his selfish acts. I was very confused for a long time, wondering how I could be certain of the authenticity of his love, and yet he could be so cruel on a whim. I had to eventually block him and go no contact for awhile. 

Before he was checked into the hospital he sent me over a hundred texts. Not all lucid, but the general gist was that he loves me and we belong together. He's since had his phone taken away. We are still technically officially married, but I have already completed the separation paperwork and am waiting for the 12 month term necessary in my jurisdiction to file the divorce. We haven't seen each other in 7 months.

My question is, should I offer to see him? He is in a different country. Would this help his condition or cause more stress/confusion? I have no intention of getting back together with him, but I still care about him deeply. Thank you for listening. ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"how to bring up possibly being autistic 
two years ago a past therapist of mine casually mentioned that he found it interesting that i shared some “traits” found in folks on the spectrum. he meant it as a compliment but it got me interested in autism as a whole as i didn’t know much at all. i did research for pure educational purposes and discovered i have a lot more than a few traits. i didn’t bring it up with him though, i didn’t want him to assume i was looking for something that wasn’t really there and i figured he already thought that considering i brought up a panic disorder once and he sort of shut me down- i was diagnosed with one a year later by my current therapist. 

i stopped with the research, like i said no one takes me seriously when it comes to my genuine concerns. i’m just seen as the kid who’s looking for stuff to blame my stuff on when that clearly isn’t it. 

but in my last session with my current therapist he out of the blue asked me if i have any sensory issues. when i asked what he meant he listed the basics, the ones you read about everywhere.

i got somewhat excited, he noticed something in me after talking about something not at all related to my theory and felt the need to ask me. i felt if i didn’t give him a quick enough answer he would just assume i was faking and shut me down so i anxiously blurted out that i had a noise sensitivity. 

i do not have a noise sensitivity- im a jumpy person but have no issue with sound.

i do have a touch sensitivity thing that i always struggled with. i prefer if people didn’t touch me at all but i have spots i feel most uncomfortable with. certain spots even ache like my ribs, sides and arm when touched. 

i couldn’t take my words back so i started talking about how i’ve always been a jumpy person. i feel like he looked right through me and dismissed it as what it was, a jumpy kid who had no issue with noise. 

i want to bring it up again, tell him the truth without it seeming like i’m looking for something in return. if i’m autistic i want to know, personally i think it would explain a lot and then maybe i would deal with my issues differently but if not that’s just as good, i can stop kicking at myself and just continue with my treatment.

"I might have ptsd, what to do? I might have ptsd and am not sure what to do. Who do i contact, where can i get help. 

Short backstory; i am a 23 old guy who studies molecular biology in the medical field. As a child I was often afraid of the dark and that just weren’t there, i was in fear so bad i was terrorising myself for as long as i can remember. I had psychological help for my fears from when i was 5 years of age to around 10ish years of age. It didn’t really help because i was too stubborn. Later panic attacks including seizures for bloody subjects start to form. Usually i try to flee, but when i cant i am having a hard time. I am basically 24/7 on tension. I know the triggers but none of the next is related to it. Need to know where the exit routes are and need to make sure i am not blocked. I get spooked when i don’t expect someone to be there. I need to know who is where in the room and what they are doing. My life is just starting to be giant control freak shitfest. it is going downhill and i cant get it to stop evolving. I need help.

While on elementary school i had a few knock-outs caused by stories of extreme trauma my teacher had, stepped on the head by a horse, pieces of plastic to close his skull... this was not really that bad,  generally lost conciousness for a few minutes. but the mental impact really was big. since then all bloody stories caused panic attacks. Had a few instances of lost conciousness after.

Fast forward since elementary, high school, got hit by a car minor brain injury (nothing to write home about). Few years pass; biology class lessons on vascular system, i get light in the head and lose conciseness, this time with heavier physical backlash than before, heavy sweating, tired for days, muscles remain sour for a few days. Had to have my wisdom teeth removed, while discussing the removal i passed out.. 

After highschool i went to “uni” and started studying molecular medical biology. Went ok for the most part until my third year. Medical microbiology class, got forced to watch cerebral injection because there was no way to get out off the college benches. I blacked out and had a heavy seizure again, my classmates (~100 persons) and professor thought i might have had a heart atrack. Making gorgling noises and flexing hands and arms in a hands up motion. Pased out for about 10 minutes. Medical staff on the way. This time the backlash was even worse. This really made everything worse while i thought i was doing a lot better and might have shed the trauma of elementary school. I feel ashamed and am afraid of large masses of people now..

A few months passed, was on the bus to uni and a story came on the ready about a guy with a tumor in the throat. Graphical explanation how they were going to save him. I got light in the had and had to lay down in the bus, literally no one helped me even when my borther asked for help. Almost passed out but this experience really spooked me. Now i just don’t want to go on public transport, i am so scared for another seizure.

Last year i had a seizure at home, my mother and brother witnessed it. An ambulance was ordered and drfibs where brought in. They thought i had a heart attack. Literally bathing in sweat, muscles where flexed, heartbead of 10-20/min and gorgling noises. My body kept sour for more than a week. Not even talking about the mental backlash, i am so so scared for it to happen again.

Tldr: i might have ptsd from childhood fears and blood related lost of conciousness/seizures. The fear i starting to lock down my life. I need help. What do i need to do?

Next week i have a colloquium i have to attent but injust can’t go there. Classmates will discuss their medical internships, which are to much for me now. I feel on edge already. If i go i get blacked out for sure. What to do?",ptsd,ptsd
"Is how you stim a definite factor of autism? So, I've been researching this quite heavily over the past couple of days and haven't been able to find proper clarity.

The thing that makes me thing that I have some form of autism is stimming. But it's incredibly confusing, because I only perform stimming typical to people who have autism when I'm very excited/and or happy. I only do this when I'm alone too and never let me see anyone do it; sometimes it is done subconsciously but the type of stimming that's highlighted in autism only occurs when I am very elevated and alone.

Otherwise, in public places such as University, I tap my foot, moving my leg up and down and sometimes play with a pen. 

The other symptom that makes me think I could be on the spectrum is that I prefer my own company and sometimes when I'm placed with people I don't know, I get very anxious (particularly in large crowds) However, at the same time I am very capable of social interaction when asked upon and am often the first to understand a joke.

"Dealing with yourself after a trigger (rape trigger warning) I've been working hard these last few years in identifying my triggers, but I'm still not all together in stopping them from ruining my thoughts and ability to feel much besides anger and numbness for days. 

Ex boyfriend contacted me. Told me he got a promotion and then shared a bunch of romantic texted messages his girlfriend sent him and how I never treated him so good. You can imagine how that would have hurt anyone, let alone someone with PTSD. I blocked him. Again. Hopefully I can have the strength to make it forever. 

Then I felt like I'm the reason why my fiance isn't finding success. My ex wouldn't have been where he is today if he were stuck with me and my two kids. This is definitely true about my SO as well. How successful and happy would this man be without me and the burden of these kids? But when I tried to tell him how I was feeling, he said that its ""Just me that thinks this way."" And then deflected my emotions by being rude in a ""playful"" way. So, I numbed up real fast. 

I woke up today angry. My SO has been wanting sex and I have had zero desire for it. In fact, I dont even want him nor my kids nor my dog to touch me. But I am angry when he distances himself and acts like I'm not there. So I snap and yell at the kids to clean the house. SO finally figures out that I'm not feeling good so he comes and gives me a hug. That makes me feel better for most of the day, but I know I'm still not over my trigger yet. 

SO still wants sex tonight. I figure I'd try, but I'm dry as a desert and there is not even a tingle of desire there. His attempts to get me ready only bring physical pain. He detects this and refuses to have sex. I feel like I let him down and am angry with my body for betraying me. It would have been better if he would have just had sex. I could have faked it. But no. Instead I do the weird sleep thing I do when I am experiencing sexual trauma. The same sleep thing that happened with my ex husband that lead to him raping me in my sleep. My SO would never touch me while I was unconscious, but he has needs and took care of them on his side of the bed while I was passed out. I woke up when he finished. Just like I did when my ex husband finished raping me. I feel... I dont even know what. I cannot sleep now. I want to abandon everyone. My kids, my SO, my dog. The rest of my family I have already since abandoned. I want to just live in a camper van in total solitude and be out in the wilderness sitting in hot springs and trout fishing and hiking.

I honestly just sought therapy to help with my depression and anxiety symptoms, but my therapist feels that if we can handle the root--the trauma--it'll help in a more lasting way than just dealing with things as they come up.

Has anyone been through this? What can I expect? I've been through CBT before and it's been helpful (I haven't had panic attacks since, for example) but we didn't get into the trauma side of things, just symptom management.

"Very pissed of with my psychrist interview, looking for adivces I hope I do not upset someone here with my bad english. I usually do review but I'm so irritated and anxious now I can't do it.

My currently status explicited in doctor's informations are symptoms pointing to depression, anxiety, diagnosed with ADHD and recently suspicious of autism spectrum, maybe behavior dependency too (like gaming). 

I'm being watched in a government health service specialized in dependency like drugs, sex and gambling. It's about 8 months going to a group meeting focused into non-chemical dependecy.

Before that I've being diagnosed with generalized anxiety by another doctor individually. At the first meeting he denied the possibility of ADHD and gave me sertraline and clonazepam, for 8~9 months I took the sertraline regularly and since the problems which made me search for help didn't get better, I've a few times about the result of my condition to him because my empathy of disappointment people feel deplates trough my skin instantly only by seeing their facial expressions of sadness. So after the 8~9 months I decided to stop taking sertraline and that gave some problems during the intake. That's how I went the place I'm now. I have some disruptive or addicted behaviors indicators during my life and reporting it resulted on this. The place I'm in also have a individual psychiatrist for 4 months before the change, I'm in the 4th now but they can and do use the previous notes of others psychiatrists. I had 2 interviews with the currently one that's the point I'll talk about being upset.

The first interview with her was ok. The second was terrible. There is a Chief Clinical responsible for the local. He has some discussion with those doctors and somehow help and supervise them.

The place is focused into addiction, since some hints point to not being addicted because I can not think into things usually cannot stop in different places, it does not fit their classical model of addiction. I do not complaing about it, I had a part of my life which I'd  had addiction to gaming (to the point of stealing to fullfill it) and it stopped more than 17 years ago at least.

During the 2nd interview, she asked if I do have/worry about hygiene. My answer - Of course, I always take shower beforing leaving home, wash my teeths, make the beard,etc. I was sweaty that they because it was hot, I was anxyous for being late for the appointment and took a REALLY crowded bus and I felt a bad smell I don't usually have being sweaty and that may be the source for her questioning me. I'm almost sure that the smell is not from sweaty but my cleaning machine doing weird noises when working mixed with athlethic clothes. The instant I weared it and felt something wrong but worsened when leaving home than started sweating. It's also being compared to other situations I had the same level of sweaty and it wasn't noticeable except by view. And me explainning all these stupid shits is result of these negative behavior spreading into my mind.

It's like having a F5 button running and looping the same episode in my head. I had it before for different reasons and it's HORRIBLE.

After that interview this question is on my head like all the time with negatives toughts reforcing it. Also, I had many experiences of people doing negative comments with contempt or disrepectiful with me or other and these situations are very remarkable the way the people talk, the way the face express it and the after answer behavior. I sincerely don't remember any situation which these comments where I consider the choice of doing such comment sounds exacly like a pre-bully behavior. All the time when the people really doesn't want to hurt someone but still need an answer, they do warn like ""I'll ask you something and take it personally"" or after ""Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you, it's only because other people would react different"" .   That's was  not my case. 

I also have a different way to thing, I know. All the rage I have right now is concentrated to the individual of day 14/03/18 which made the comment with disgusting face/tone when doing so, and reproval face/tone when I gave the answer. I'll not consider her as the same shitty person that made that comment because I thing people may have triggers or weakness that may lead to shitty comment's or attitudes. People can just be bad but I NEVER work at this point of view.

 Felt like someone asking to a big guy: ""Don't you worry about chairs accidentally breaking when you sit?"" The big buy ""Of course I do, I'm trying to change it condition(surprised tone with question)""  and  a reproval comment like ""uhum"" and changing the topic without explanning WHAT SHIT QUESTION JUST MAKE?

The fact that the clinical chief already showed directly and indirectly that I'm incovenient in that place for demanding their time and not exactly fifting the standart patients, by sometimes isolating myself quietly or leaving in the middle of group meeting without conflict. Those informations came to me trought that psychiatrist by questions she made like ""do you think is normal leaving during a meeting group"" (I returned) ""do you think is normal being isolated in a corner?"" FUCK off if it's normal, I didn't really mean to cause problem and didn't make noise or shake my body like hell.

So, I hope I can have some advices from here because reddit does provide the best answers/advices. It's like the user's here are a type of superspecies comming from secret places and sharing the content of book of wisdow their head possess. In currently state, the next time I go there and elegantly tell than to fuck off after explanning that I do separate things and don't care if they doesn't have that ability but I'm pissed so fuck off again and if it would result into dropping me out I sadly embrace it as necessary with no regrets. 
If they come with hypocrite speechs like ""you are misunderstading things"" I'll send them to hell again. I can't stand politics behavior when I expect sincerity. It's self preservation manipulation. They are not worried of our anguish, what they want is to remove the bad feeling they are having by taking out of our mouths ""Yea, it was a misunderstading"", ""I excuse you"" to make they fell better and go home sleep well with their self esteem/ego crossing the heaven watching unicorns farting chocolate while I struggle 24 hours thinking about that episode.  I think the correctly answer would be ""Sorry, I didn't really notice that and I'll not repeat such comment again"". I would be satisfied but the probabilty of it happening that way is like Pope Francis discovering a new law of quantum mechanics. 

That's the first time I made a crybaby like topic so forgive for this and if you still want to give me advices be welcome, that's why I came here. ",adhd,adhd
"I ranted about this on peach but apparently i feel the need to rant here too-- feat. imposter syndrome and ED ""goals"" I'm still not sure whether or not I actually have an ED-- the imposter syndrome is real here. Perfectly ""normal"" people engage in the same behaviors I do, and I truly feel like I could just stop tomorrow if I really wanted to. Naturally, that could also mean I'm in deep denial because I haven't admitted I have a problem. But what if there's no problem to admit to? This shit TORTURES me, guys.

The other thing I mentioned on peach &amp; feel like shit about is that I have a fucked up ED ""goal"". I want to faint from restriction/fasting. I feel so goddamn invalid because no matter how much I fast (record is 6 days), I've never gotten that dizzy might-pass-out feeling. Other people will collapse after 24 hours of fasting. I should probably be glad that my body adapts well to shit, but damn it makes me feel even MORE invalid somehow. Like I don't have a problem because I'm a-okay physically. So as fucked up as it is, I want my mental pain to physicalize. I want to pass out or something, and THEN I'll have a problem. Then I'll feel valid.

So between the imposter syndrome and the need to faint from my ED, I'm legit scared that I'm just doing this for attention even though nobody knows and I go to great lengths to hide my food issues. Basically I'm just neurotic as fuck. 

Thank you for letting me rant (again). I'm guessing quite a few of you can relate. ",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

He learned to walk and talk at around age 4, which is later than most children. However, doctors predicted he wouldn’t walk or talk at all.

The good spirits tell me to read the bible, exercise, eat healthy (I've never been religious until now), never give up, and they tell me to get a job and go back to college.

"[School Project] Autism and South-America/Asia // Help ! Dear Reddit community,

I, and 8 other colleagues, are working on a school project where we want to draw the most accurate and up-to-date map of autism awareness, autism diagnostic techniques, autism structures and patient pathways for South-America and Asia.

We are looking for any kind of quantitative as much as qualitative data, and as you can guess, for instance, to perform interviews.

We are as much interested as interviewing doctors and nurses as people who simply have somebody in their family going through this disease.

If you would have any suggestion of places to contact, people to connect with, it would be very useful to us.  


Additionally, we are totally open to share with you the output of our work and progress, as for us it is important to give back. For instance, we have done so far a couple of interviews of key players as well as a pretty detailed scientific literature analysis of autism in South America.

"Relapsed twice this month I have been struggling with my eating disorder since sophomore year of high school and i'm now currently a freshman in college (\~3.5 years) meaning my parents are quite aware of it. 

Before I went away to university my parents were very direct about reaching a weight they came up with my doctor and not fluctuating too far from it (I was allowed about 10 pounds of wiggle space) and my first semester I did fine, eating healthy and working out but not taking it to an extreme. 

This semester has been more stressful so I have been not only stress eating but skipping the gym for the library- I am now the heaviest I have ever been. This is horrible for my mental health, so I tried to go back to eating healthy and being an avid gym user but I am now just stuck at this disgusting weight and I can not get rid of any of it. 

Leading to the beginning of this month where I fasted for three days and then went back to normal. I figured it was a one time thing but tonight I just couldn't eat. It wasn't that I felt fat, which I now did but I didn't at dinner, I just couldn't will myself to put my fork to my mouth without feeling guilt. 

I'm sitting in my kitchen, surrounded by food that my roommates have left on the table including bags of chips and brownies and my stomach is grumbling and this has made me *proud.* I haven't experienced thoughts like this in so long, and I know it's normal I suffered from them being way too loud for years but I don't want to be thinking these things.

So, who am I. Girl of 25. Grown up in a dysfunctional family, I don't want to add too many details so I'll try to keep this short - father was violent, mother depressed, my older sister is in complete isolation since 18. 

I escaped that shithole at 23. However sometime I have this memory that torments me. My boyfriend doesn't know. My (few) friends never knew. My therapist doesn't know.
This memory that torments me is my mother, 7 years ago, that keeps calling me slut.
Why?
Because she was constantly having dreams about me and my father having sex.
She was rejecting me, and insulting me, everyday.
For something in her own head. Something so embarrassing and sad that I cannot tell to anybody.

"I'm terrified to talk about my trauma in therapy again I was sexually assaulted at 18 (that was in 2013). I was diagnosed with PTSD last year and I struggle with flashbacks of my assault constantly. It's like a movie playing in my head.

I started doing exposure therapy and it worked, though it was incredibly draining. I eventually stopped because life got in the way (a breakup, then finals, then I moved). I meant to put it on hold and come back to it but I never did.

I convinced myself I was probably over it and that I shouldn't give it more attention because I'd talked about it in quite a bit of detail. But I'm not over it, I think about it every day. And I mean every single day. I feel like I'm carrying a poisonous secret.

My therapist is on vacation right now and I'm psyching myself to talk about it again when he comes back. I know I need to do it, but it hurts just to think about it and I want to keep putting it off indefinitely even though I know that's a bad idea.

There's also a little voice in my head that still blames me for what happened. I had a crush on my abuser and I didn't even register it as abuse at the time, but I remember subconsciously having my guard up when I was around him because I thought he might do something to me again. Why did I keep seeing him after what he did to me? That's one of the things that makes me ashamed to talk about it. I feel guilty.

"Delusions - want to understand I would like to understand more from people who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

I have good reason to believe my long-term partner has a schizo-related disorder due to matching the symptoms. Whether or not they have schizophrenia or some type of schizo-affective disorder, they have been heavily invested for a few months now in what could only be called ""Delusions"". Delusions that the project they've been working on will make millions (while not really working on it,) delusions that different people are telling them what to do (take clothes off in public for example) and that they can easily arrange to meet certain famous people.

I am not judging because for a while I was completely caught up in many of these delusions. I found myself agreeing to move to another state with practically no thought behind it. I found myself saying ""yes, you are going to make millions on your project."" Does that mean I was encouraging the delusions? Have I done something wrong?

My partner is now hospitalized as an in-patient awaiting a diagnosis, because they were determined to be a danger to themselves and others and they are not able to care for themselves daily as far as getting themselves food, basic activities. Even though I wasn't actively encouraging these delusions (believed a couple of them) she has a couple of friends who REALLY encouraged delusions -- told my partner her head was full of sh\*t that was leaking everywhere? Then she wouldn't stop talking for days about how her head was full of shit that is leaking everywhere. I guess I wonder if that friend believed the delusions as well.

"65 yr old father has 3-5 drinks a day, should I be alarmed? Hello everyone. I am trying to figure out if I should have a talk with my dad about his drinking habits.

My dad works a fairly stressful job though its a lot easier now that he's working slightly less hours. His kids including myself are grown and don't really need the financial support but he is at the point in his life where he worked pretty much his life's entirety so he has no other identity other than work. One way he would cope with the stress is by drinking and its a habit that has also stuck with him.

The sad thing is even when my dad has days off, he knows no other way of relaxing other than drinking. So even when he's not even particularly stressed or in a relaxed mood he STILL drinks. Sometimes even more.

My dad turned 65 recently but that has not changed the amount of drinks he has daily. He can go up to 5 drinks on any given day. And he drinks everyday without fail.

He does not exhibit any behavior problems when he drinks though. No belligerence or poor conduct at work or home. He usually drinks either in the middle of a day off or at night after work. On any given week, I would say he drinks the equivalent of 15 drinks a week.

So despite the fact that my dad doesn't have any behavioral problems or misconduct from drinking would you say he has some dependency on alcohol? And if so how do I have a conversation with him about how he can cut down his drinking? I really worry about his health and the fact that he really has nothing else but work and drinking in his daily routine.

I told my parents about my intentions and basically got laughed at first and then they told me to just keep my job and don't do it.

However, I do want to do it. Its driving me crazy, knowing that I will probably quit halfway through... So my question to you guys is: What do you do to keep yourself motivated/disciplined enough to follow through?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading this far, I know it isn't easy to read a looong block of text, but Im happy you made it :)",adhd,adhd

"84 hours of being triggered but I'm doing better. 2 months ago today I finished being in labour for 84 hours. The pain of the contractions was similar enough to abuse I've suffered that I was triggered horribly. I had to have my husband talk to me through them so I didn't risk lashing out at the midwives in blind panic.

I know I'm not the only one that hates seeing a loved one having to see us go through that. He knows a lot of my history but until I was pregnant my husband had never seen a panic that didn't have an outside trigger. There was nothing he could do to stop it though he did admit after that if I had said no to the epidural in the labour room he was going to find a way to go around me, for my own sake. The midwife honestly looked like she would have been tempered to help especially since she told me to get one instead of suggesting it. Not that I needed convincing.

I hadn't slept in 2 days and still had to give birth.

It took a long while to shake off the feel of that panic and helplessness but seeing my healthy, happy bub helps a lot. I don't regret going through that for him, but I've never wished more that during that 84 hours that I didn't have to go through my abuse to begin with. Luckily, I'm doing better and am stable when dealing with my mother (abuser/enabled other abuse). 

The labour made me realize her behaviour put my son at risk and if I get blinded by panic and rage when even hearing about her she still controls me and that just gives the triggers more power.

"Not being able to determine what or who other people know I’m not sure if this is specific to autism (furthermore, I’ve never been formally diagnosed). I have a huge problem with figuring out what information other people know, and how that information can be shared to other people. In the back of my mind, I know other people talk to one another and have their own lives and social circles. However, when I mention things to people and they say, “I already know that, (other person) told me” — it’s always shocking to me. I’m equally bad at figuring out how people communicate with one another, or the closeness of communication.

"Finding alternatives to biting my lips and the inside of my mouth. I'm 25 years old and in the process of being officially diagnosed with aspergers.
(I have had multiple health proffesionals tell me they are sure about me being on the spectrum and currently am revieving therapy but waiting on a specialist to recieve a formal diagnosis).
I study, work and live by myself so I think I would be considered high functioning. 

Problem is that one of my most 'favorite' ways to focus and release stress is biting my lip, tongue and inside of my cheeks. I have done this since I can remember, I kinda 'peel' the skin of my cheeks and inside of my lip and bite smal pieces of my tongue. It gets worse when stressed and I am looking for alternatives that don't harm my body.
Only really good way to stop and calm myself is doing this other stimming thing I do that is rubbing a certain kind of fabric on my lips.
The reason I look for other things is that it 'looks weird' to other adults carying a piece of fabric around and rubbing it on my lips.

I looked at biting necklaces but wondered If they are more for childeren, are there any adults here that have used them and liked them as an alternative to biting?
I don't bite for the pain it is more a 'fidgeting' thing, are there fidget things for inside your mouth? 
Have people gotten a tongue piercing to fidget with?
Or have people found fidget toys that helped keep their hands busy, things that you can pick at or peel or something?

"A little help would be appreciated... Please. So, I'm *fairly certain* that I have autism of some kind. I'm 20 now, almost 21 and only just found out in the past few months. I haven't been properly diagnosed yet but I was going to ask my counselor about having me evaluated/tested/whatever. But for the sake of this post let's at least assume that I am because I'm at a loss for what to do.

My girlfriend, I've been with her for about 9 months, has finally gotten fed up with my autism, because I don't know how to manage it yet. She says I've gotten cold, but I'm not sure what she means or how to be ""warm"" like she wants. I repeat myself a lot and she can't stand that. And other things I'm not sure how to put into words because she won't tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm positive that if I understood the problems, I could be a better boyfriend for her, but she won't tell me because she ""isn't my teacher"". And she's right, she has no obligation to teach me how to solve my problems. But that means I have nowhere else to turn but you, and my counselor.

Another problem I have is depression, anxiety, and things like that. I'm not sure how to manage these alongside autism, as the strategies I've always used have never worked too well anyway.

And lastly, for any more Christian-minded people here, I'm also struggling to understand the Bible, and be a true, good Christian like I should. It's like reading another language, it kinda just bounces off my brain and does nothing. Please, don't comment on this particular issue unless you'll try to help with it, because it'll only make me upset and confused if I get a bunch of people text-shouting at me about atheism or whatever. I don't force you to believe what I do, don't force me to believe what you do.

Trouble retaining information after giving up alcohol I’m a 25 year old male I recently quit drinking in December and since then I’ve been trying to get my life back on track after 4 years of alcohol abuse.

"Books/resources for adults with autism? I am a 23 year old female and am currently trying to obtain a diagnosis for ASD. During my time at university I studied special education with a focus on ASD, and only after learning extensively about autism have I started putting the pieces together in my own life. 

I show many, many signs of autism that have been explained away throughout my whole life. I have very slowly begun to accept that I likely have autism, and looking at my difficulties in this way has already helped me greatly with coping in difficult social situations or in times when I feel overstimulated.

Because I studied special education, I have seen numerous resources regarding strategies for helping children with autism. However, as I try to learn more about managing my own struggles I can't seem to find good sources of information that are targeted at adults, especially those adults who have gone undiagnosed.

I cannot currently afford a diagnosis or therapy of any sort, but I just got my first full time job so I am working towards it. In the meantime, are there any good books or resources I could find to give me a better understanding of how to manage my own issues? I'm particularly interested in developing better coping strategies for overstimulation and learning more about appropriate social interaction.

"Could my lifelong response to stomping be evidence of mild trauma? I had an pretty unhappy upbringing, not like I was horribly neglected or anything, but my mom embodies a lot of the toxic and unhealthy behaviors in alignment with [narcissistic/emotionally immature parenting](http://parrishmiller.com/narcissists.html). In fact, we've been semi-estranged for 15 years; I ran away from home when I was 17 and basically never went back. Nobody really questioned my decision tbh, everyone understood why I'd want to get away from her, including my dad.

Growing up, the sound of heavy footsteps suddenly heading in my direction always meant that I was about to be punished for something, whether I deserved it or not. Despite it having been over 15 years since I've been around my mom, I still have a fleeting emotional response to the sound of stomp-walking that has never really gone away. When I hear sudden stomping, for a brief fleeting moment, I'm overcome with a sense of fear and that someone is coming to get me. This sucks because I live in a dense metropolitan area these days where stomp-walking is a normal aspect of apartment living. My neighbors regularly elicit this brief episode of fear in me and it stresses the shit out of me.

"Wife needing perspective My husband is an alcoholic. He won't say that, but it's true from my perspective. He has ruined us financially because he won't go to work, he has completely checked out of our 15 year marriage and 3 kids for a long period of time, and he is psychologically abusive (in my opinion). 

In October I had finally had enough after he told me on a Wednesday he would stop drinking and got black out drunk and pooped his pants the following Saturday. We have 3 kids. I can't live this way any longer. I told him he either had to leave or stop drinking. He chose to leave. 

He came back after a week with promises of going to AA and therapy and church, and no alcohol. I believed him. I even made him sign a contract promising to uphold it, because in the past, all the times we've had the same conversation, it didn't work. 

In the next two weeks he stayed sober. Traded his truck in, got himself a new used car, made a lot of big decisions financially (took out a large loan, when he only needed a couple of hundred dollars), and then suddenly one morning decided I was ""too quiet"", not affectionate enough, a nag, etc. etc. and he took his belongings and left again. Again!

He was only gone a day, but in that day he went to his mothers and got drunk. I asked if he was serious about his sobriety, then why would his first instinct be to drink? I try to be understanding. I know everyone has issues, we all have trauma. I know things aren't an easy straight line. But why? 

He said it's because he doesn't have a drinking problem, he's only sober to please me. 

Another month goes by. He was ok for most of it, but he never did any of the things he promised other than staying sober, but then he started getting mad at little stuff again. On a Sunday morning, he woke up, left for 4 hours, came home with his bumper popped off, and in a GREAT mood. I thought, either he's cheating or was drinking. Because he's lied about being drunk a million times. (Which he now says never happened.) He told me he didn't tell me where he was going because I was ""short"" with him, and I deserved it. He took his stuff and left again, under the guise on my unreasonable behavior. 

He went to his mothers and drank again. 

His Mom knows this problem and says she's never ""seen"" it as a problem there for she believes her loved ones when they say it's ok. Even though her brother OD'd and died from drugs that she claimed weren't a problem. 

He came home again the next day. Establishing again, that I deserved it, because I shouldn't have been mistrustful. 

Today, it's been 2 weeks. And he's gone again. Because this time I asked him to take out left overs to the trash. 

I keep begging him to help with the kids or the house, because he barely works now, and he still refuses. So this morning he started the day with, ""You're being unreasonable. We can't communicate. To build better communication skills, I think I should live at my mothers for a while.""

So I'm telling him I need him and his response is to leave. To build better communication, his solution is to do it less. And to build trust in the perspective of alcoholism, he needs to go live where he's had some of his worst moments? 

I think he's finding some way to turn me into a bad person so he can justify (to himself) that he should leave and in turn, drink. All the times he leaves, the first thing he does is drink. 

He blames me for everything in his life, down to once he tripped at work, and he told me it was my fault he tripped because I took up to much of his time thinking. If it weren't for ME he wouldn't have tripped. 

I feel like he is turning that same perspective into finding faults so he can find excuses to leave, and then drink. He is completely all over the place. Him saying he couldn't live with me and needed to leave, an hour later after me literally sobbing and saying ""If you'll just tell me how to talk to you I will"" because he says I'm \*too loud, then I try and talk calmly and I'm \*condescending, which then I try and \*email which he ignores, and then I \*text and he won't respond. So I'm out of ideas. I'm out of hope. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is never going to stop, is it? And am I at all justified in thinking all his issues with leaving me FOUR times in 2 months stems from him finding ways to fault me so he can go drink? Because he says that's insane. Even though that's exactly what he does. 

I never knew he had so much anger or hostility toward me, nor thought I was such a bad wife, until I gave him the ultimatum in October. And he has made my life hell ever since. And I feel so incredibly stupid because I keep thinking it'll stop or get better, and it just keeps repeating that same sick cycle. ",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Questions While recently thinking over the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, I began to wonder, what causes this excess dopamine in the first place? Is this known yet? Or is it extremely complex and we don't really understand exactly why yet and just know that antipsychotics block dopamine so we assume there is too much? 

Also does anybody have experience taking glycine transporter one inhibitors such as sarcosine or the even newer ones?

Does anybody have a good understanding of which areas of the brain are different between schizophrenics and non-schizophrenics and how they differ? If so, would it be possible to explain the regular function of these brain areas to me? 

For example, I read this paragraph earlier today:
The most consistent structural abnormalities found in schizophrenia include lateral and third ventricular enlargement; medial temporal lobe (hippocampal formation, subiculum, parahippocampal gyrus) volume reductions; and superior temporal gyrus volume reductions, particularly on the left. There is also moderate evidence for frontal lobe volume reduction, particularly of prefrontal and orbitofrontal regions, and parietal lobe abnormalities. Enlarged cavum septi pellucidi, basal ganglia abnormalities, corpus callosum abnormalities, thalamus abnormalities, and cerebellar abnormalities are also evident.

"Numbers of a dry drunk Did some counting the other day which was pretty revealing to me.

I haven’t had a drink in nearly two months (after nearly 7 years of mostly on, sometimes off heavy drinking). I had tried and given up on AA ( X 2) in the past three years. In any case, I was feeling pretty good lately, hadn’t had the old cravings and able to suppress any remnant urges. Made me question why I didn’t get my act together sooner.

Then I had a day where I was able to unexpectedly work from home. I didn’t drink, but I did have two separate, hour long porn viewing sessions and also called a phone sex line. Toward the end of the day after a nice long nap where I remember looking forward to not thinking, I took four sleeping pills and ended up smoking weed with a friend because I was so worried about not being able to sleep that night once I realized the pills weren’t immediately knocking me out.

I had a moment of clarity at the end of the day (while high on the amalgam of chemicals)and realized that wasn’t the day of a normal, sober person and had a better insight into what the dry drunk could be all about.

I realized that my porn/“legal”/“semi-legal” substance use had sneakily escalated the last several weeks and I was not so subtly replacing the escapism provided by alcohol with other activities.

"Dr Strange is on the autism spectrum   

I am not an expert in human behavior, but when you raise a child on the autism spectrum you learn to spot the marker behaviors in others (or even in yourself). While watching Doctor Strange I noticed a pattern in Stephen Strange’s behavior that was similar to several marker behaviors of people on the autism spectrum. Below is a list of some of the things that I noticed.

· Intelligence: Stephen definitely has a high degree of intelligence. He was quickly able to grasp advanced subjects while studying at Kamar Taj. He is the greatest of the Sorcerer Supreme, as stated by the Ancient One in Avengers: Endgame. And he was able to simultaneously earn his PhD and MD while in college due to his photographic memory.

· Interpersonal / Social: Personal relationships can be difficult for Stephen as shown in his complex relationship with Christine. Furthermore, Christine was the only person shown visiting him after the accident, possibly indicating that he was not close to anyone else, be it family or other friends. In fact, the aura of arrogance that Stephen projects might actually be an unintentional consequence of his inability to interact with others. He also has a certain disregard for other people’s feelings. In Thor: Ragnarök he kept teleporting Thor around the sanctum, regardless of Thor’s protests, even causing Thor to tumble down the stairs. He also left Loki falling in oblivion for 30 minutes.

· Sensory: Stephen’s senses are heightened, as evidenced when he was distracted by Dr Nicodemus West’s watch while Stephen was in surgery. He was very tactile as shown when Stephen was touching the prayer wheels while traveling the streets in search of Kamar Taj. In addition, he displayed a lack of eye contact with people with which he was interacting, although this one did not occur too often.

· Special Interest: Stephen’s knowledge of music, as shown in his opening scene, would be one example of something with which he was obsessed. He obsession with watches, which I assume was a metaphor for time, was another special interest. After his traffic accident his obsession with music and watches was replaced by an understandable obsession to heal his hands.

· Mimicking Behavior: Stephen’s high degree of skill as a surgeon may have been acquired from shadowing a particularly proficient surgeon while in medical school.

· Meltdown: Stephen is shown throwing his laptop and yelling at Christine when he is thwarted in an attempt to pursue his special interest, healing his hands.

In the end this is just a fan theory, and I don’t know if it was due to character choices on the part of director Scott Derrickson or actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Either way, I like to think that Doctor Strange is on the autism spectrum because the coolest people that I know are autistic!",autism,autism

"I [22M] Have A [32M] Colleague On The Spectrum, and I'm Not Sure How To Help Him. I want to make him feel more comfortable on the job.  

A little subtext to the title. Apologies if I worded that wrong, still new to this whole thing.

I work at a REALLY small radio station in the middle of nowhere, Canada. I really hope that's not a real place...

My colleague and I have been working together for almost 7-8 months now and early on, he told me he's autistic.

Frankly I don't see him as different, don't treat him differently than any one, but as the months have gone on, I've found it difficult to help him.

He's in charge of the station and often gets very overwhelmed by a lot of the stress and tends to lash out at me as a way to calm himself. That or he'll lock himself into his office all day, not speaking to a single person.

I understand that's probably a mechanism to help him cope, but my other Colleague and I are frightened by how quickly he can snap. We want to help him feel comfortable and safe, but at the same time, it's becoming a larger and larger challenge.

With that in mind [/r/autism](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism), I was hoping for your help.

Teach me how I can help him.

How I can explain to him how I'm feeling in a professional manner, and also have him understand our feelings.

Often it feels like it's him against the world, when we want him to be a team with us.

&amp;#x200B;

In short: 

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, due to the events that I observed around me, this is including activities on Facebook, the conversations that people had whilst I was with them, the conversations that I had with them on calls, I started noticing that they were indirectly referring to me. Though at first I thought certain things are mere coincidences only, I observed that it goes beyond to a level that I could consider as a coincidence, thus made me believe that my friends are talking about me. This kept on happening for a long time. And then later I observed people started referring to the conversations that I'm having at home thus proving me that my house has been hacked now(I observed extremely high number of synchronicities) yet I could not find any identifiable source for this leak of private conversations. These incidences created delusions in me such as my friends have fixed microphones in my house, my neighbors' are listening to my conversations, they see me through camera's etc..

I had lots of arguments with my friends but all the time, it became a surprise to them yet the very next day it kept on happening giving me evidence of lying by my friends about their involvement. This abnormal phenomena or the synchronicities simply fooled me again and again to think that my friends are indeed participating and they are listening to my private conversations.

Later, I observed that people started referring to my thoughts too. Again I had to conclude this due to high number of synchronicities only. Certain times, I tested if my friends could refer to my thoughts by thinking specific things and again, they responded just like they knew my thoughts. Therefore, at this time I had no doubts about my conclusions. Which made me to conclude that my friends are taking NSA's (this is another false conclusion) help in decoding my thoughts. I thought NSA could have this technology since so many people online was claiming the same. At this point, people in TV and Radio also started referring to my thoughts, I also got emails from companies like Microsoft, Guardian, etc.. where these email heading always showed a meaning to my life events, which made me believe that so many people around the world knows me. And their participating in this strange harassment. These events made me to completely stop meeting my friends cause I couldn't trust them any longer. The phenomena (synchronicities) created the trust issues.

However, later I thought I should directly handle this situation and I started having a serious conversation with one friend and he actually tried to help me. This made me to trust my friend and I knew this friend usually meet certain friends regularly and they would not lie to each other for something like this. Since, this phenomena convinced me that my friends are involved in this harassment, I created a chain of trust to understand this abnormal phenomena through him by asking him to clarify if others are aware of anything related to my life. To surprise me they also didn't know anything.

I started having deep thoughts, how I ended up in having such conclusions? What really happened to me? Why do I see a totally different world view now when I analyze this phenomena from trusted channels or trusted parties? Did someone fool me for such a long time on a daily basis? What could be the purpose and if so how? These events were real, I wasn't dreaming. To address these controversies I decided to check Facebook walls too. So I started checking Facebook profiles/ their walls, just to make sure that these statuses made by my friends, the things they shared on their walls in the past are still there and I could still find it. If so did someone hacks their profiles or did they actually made these statuses? But even if this is hacking, how can I find a logical reason for all my other observations? What about dreams? What about TV/Radio presenters? What about scriptwriters or these dramas. Emails that I got? News articles? Power cuts, the conversations that I had over calls, etc. Hacking itself cannot explain all the controversies. Having said that I still thought of talking to my friends and wanted to know if they have actually made those statuses in the past and if so what made them do so since this should give clues to understand this mystery. And I called them, there I found out that they have actually made those statuses and shared certain posts. Certain occasions, I found out that they had random thoughts to make a status or share a post on their walls. And on certain occasions, they had specific reasons to do so. So it wasn't hacking at all, they actually had thoughts in their minds related to these actions.

To make a status or to share a post, they should have thoughts in their minds and they should make a conscious decision. Even at this point, I cannot take any of these as mere coincidences only, cause, this is beyond what I could consider as a coincidence since this kept on happening for such a long time and I carefully observed it. I tested my assumptions too and observed the reactions prior to making a conclusion. This is why I had to question the meaning of reality too and I was looking for logical answers to this mystery since at times I clearly saw controversies. Therefore, by analyzing all, I had to conclude that their thoughts are being affected in some strange way although they never knew.This was the first time that I actually knew that these are extremely abnormal coincidences or synchronicities. By affecting their thoughts, their actions have been affected. And that correlated with my life events. However, this is completely invisible to everyone. This become apparent only by deeply analyzing my observations only. We can conclude this due to the extremely high number of synchronicities that I have faced with so many people around the world. I also realized that on certain occasions my thoughts also have been affected. For example, there were times I switched on the radio just to hear them talking about me (the synchronicities).  


This unidentified influence on human brains/minds is the cause behind the meaningful events or the synchronicities that I have been observing on a daily basis. My observations and the assumptions that I made to understand these meaningful events (synchronicities) made me end up in having false conclusions. This was the reason behind my delusions. Therefore, finally I started making sense of my reality and now I understand why my friends always rejected my accusations, why they got surprised all the time.  


It was almost like this phenomena had it's own mind that is capable of understanding my life and influencing the life of the people around me thus capable of fooling me, tricking me to end up in having false conclusions. Therefore, these are not delusional references as some people might think. By analysing everything, I had to conclude that not only my mind is being decoded, people's thoughts are being affected to create these synchronicities. At that time, even my family members got a little bit afraid thinking that I'm going through some mental problems, however, I was lucky to find out finally that synchronicities were behind my false conclusions. I found out that doctors had a general belief that these are delusional references which is another false conclusion only since I found out that these are synchronicities. Simply by finding the right way to challenge these beliefs we can take people out of these beliefs.

This is not all, let me list down so many other strange life experiences that I had. I found people around the world have been going through similar experiences:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Sometimes I would think of a song and then it goes in the radio.
2. Myself and my family is having a conversation and we were teasing my cousin and then the radio plays the right track out of the blue. We all started laughing just because of the timing of the song.
3. I see my friends in my dreams and they either would call me next day or they would change their facebook status that would show correlation to my life activities.
4. I was thinking of a person and then he would call me. (This is not an experience that I had before in my life)
5. Songs got stuck in my head and I couldn’t forget no matter what I do
6. I observed that my friends would spontaneous start talking about something but at these times, I was thinking the same topic.
7. My mother would say words that was in my mind. (someone could think that the family members also participate but in my case I trusted my family members more than anyone on Earth so I disregarded these experiences and I couldn't make sense of it)

&amp;#x200B;

Thereafter I did a massive research and I found out that people who claim that they get messages from TV/Radio, their thoughts are being broadcast, people are gang stalking etc.. are due to these synchronicities only. I found out that the reason for thought broadcast is due to synchronicities only. Since the origin of thought broadcast delusion goes back to 17th to 18th century only, does that mean, something started interacting with our brains/minds during this period? Or what could be the reason? That said, addressing trust issues will vanish certain delusions that people have. What are the implications of this? When I compare my experience with others I can clearly see the correlations. When you ending up in having a false conclusion or delusion, did you also observe coincidences but later that created a false belief in you due to the way it kept on manifesting? Nevertheless, hope this help someone! ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Help for Daughter  Brand new, never posted here but thank you in advance for taking the time... I have a question.  I'll try to make it short (there is so much to tell).  My daughter married someone who did not disclose their dx or mental health history fully prior to the very short dating period and subsequent wedding, all he told her is that he's had a ""history"", and some of his past behaviors - which I'm afraid he doctored to make sound less bad / violent on his part.  They dated around six months, and they've been married for about a year and a half now.  In that time period, she's had to suffer more and more consequences for his behavior, beginning with his damaging his mom's house (she was living there with him) so much that there are so many holes in the walls and windows broken that the house looks like it should be condemned, to his being arrested a few days ago for hit and run while intoxicated IN HER (DAD's) CAR (her dad bought her a brand new car a few years ago, registered in his name as he pays for it).  He's now facing many thousands in fines, and jail time, and since the car actually is registered in her dad's name (my ex), my ex will be the one to suffer financially for an un-drive able (possibly totaled) car to sky high insurance rates (and possibly being kicked off the policy all together).  Btw, her dad and I had already told her not to let him drive the car.  And actually, since this guy doesn't work my daughter will be the one to pay all these fines and help her dad fix the car.  This incident happened while she was at school and her dad was out of town.  He's damaged her vehicle lots of times before this, mostly small stuff like kicking the windshield from the inside (cracking it severely) and breaking mirrors, etc, but now she doesn't have a car at all.  She's going to nursing school and works part time in her field, so she's really busy with all of that, and now has this added to her plate as well, along with no car / transportation.

I don't know how to help her see that this relationship is really really bad for her life.  She insists that we should all look past his ""mistakes"" and see past his mental illness to the ""real"" him, but we can't do that at this point because we're so frightened for her.  One main reason we're so scared for her is that just before he wrecked her car, they got ""evicted"" from his mom's house for him choking the mom's dog and trying to throw the dog out a second story window.  It's been said that harming animals is not a stage, it's a rehearsal, so I'm wondering if he could turn violent on my daughter.  Am I being unreasonable here, as my daughter believes because we shouldn't be emphasizing ""things"" (cars, houses, dogs) over people (her husband)?  I'm so confused, I need help.  ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

I haven't got anywhere yet, and this is tough, just trying to ventilate something.  


I'm in my early 20s, I'm a male, I live in Europe and I have a girlfriend that tries to support me.  
I am struggling today with studies, my everyday mental state and doing what I think is required of me. But I don't seem to be able to carry all of it and sometimes it comes crashing down at me. I end up crying and downwards spiraling in my thoughts. I have trouble remembering stuff, I have trouble concentrating and it doesn't feel like I will ever get to where I want to be. I'm afraid, scared and it seems that I have gotten used to the feeling of it that I don't even notice anymore. My head is failing me and it was one of my best qualities about myself.  


I grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.   


My earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.  


I became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  
I had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.  


I remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.  
I was crying and she didin't take care of me.   


When I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.  


I never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.  


I finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.  
But it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.  


Then I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  


Then.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.  
 (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)  


When I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.  
I did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.  


7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.  
2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )  


I had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)  
I started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.  


I have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.   


I have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.  
I did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.  
It felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.   
(English is not my primary language.)

  
I'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)  
I try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.

  
I found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.  
I know, it's f\*\*ked up but thank you for feeling like this and thank you for sharing!",ptsd,ptsd

"Is this real? (Tw: child abuse and gas lighting?) Hi everyone. I'm new here and new to PTSD. I originally started getting help for what I initially thought was depression and anxiety. But after meeting with mental health professionals I now know those were symptoms not the problem. I've only had the diagnosis for about 12 months and had my first sit down with my dedicated therapist on Friday. I have been a rollercoaster emotionally lately and since it will be 2 weeks before I see him again. I was told to use crisis services in case of emergency but to keep him in the loop. 

Saturday I had what a crisis services operator described as a flashback. I had been thinking of my grandpa who we lost recently. When a phantom smell hit me and I remembered Charles my fathers father and what he did. Well I never forgot him but I remembered his actions instead of just happy times with him and my family. 

I'm shaken. My wife and I have long suspected that I had been a victim of sexual abuse. But I never could remember anything like that. I had a very emotionally and physically abusive childhood which led me to seek help initially. Now I have these detailed memories of Charles and I'm oscillating between being terrified that I'm just being over dramatic. That I'm just making this up for attention that this was all just a figment of my overactive imagination on one end. And accepting this and trying to move forward as best as we can. Mind you these abuses happened 17+ years ago as he has been dead that long. 

Thanks for reading this. I guess I'm just asking is it normal to feel like this? Do you all find that when things came back to you you doubted your sanity as well? I'm worried I'm just being a drama queen like usual.",ptsd,ptsd
Feeling embarrassed I have not had a drink in 35 days. Really proud of myself. My husband announced this afternoon that he is going to an alanon meeting tonight.

"Remembering traumas I forgot about I don’t know why I’m writing this tbh but okay, here we go. I’m diagnosed with PTSD but I think it would be classified as cPTSD if that diagnose was used here. I have over 10 traumas that I remembered when I first was diagnosed. 

The thing is, after accidentally reading notes the doctors at different ERs wrote when I was a kid, I remember a lot more. And not only the things they’d written about, but also other stuff that I had completely forgot.

I get flashbacks to traumatic events that I didn’t know about, but seeing them in the flashbacks is making me remember it all. I know it’s real, but at the same time I’m scared my mind is playing tricks on me. And I have flashbacks constantly nowadays.

"Job Problems Hey everyone,

Looking to vent and maybe some advice.

Im dealing with cognitive impairments from either the illness or the medication. Not very severe, but enough that I notice it in certain areas and am worried about it. My memory is bad and my mind is often blank. For instance, in conversations I have little to say and just generally slow thinking with bad memory. The problem is my current job is very sort of cognitive heavy/intellectual. I got a job in a Central Bank where I'm part of a team to supervise and regulate financial firms. This means as a team, we meet with and discuss with financial firms on the performance etc and the financial risks to their firm. My role is pretty junior so far so I havent been directly doing the hard stuff yet but I can see that my cognitive impairments will get in my way in the future. The work requires so so much study and knowledge which is hard for me to retain. And there's also a problem in meetings or in work conversations I struggle to keep up with the conversation and provide any input at all. Holding meetings with the firms is a key part of the job which Ill be expected to do in the future. I know theres a certain degree of being new and knowing less etc in the beginning but I notice this in normal conversations not just work related. I can see this getting in my way of progressing or even doing my job once the full responsibilities are given to me when Im not so new anymore.

This is affecting my self esteem and gives me a lot of anxiety in work. I hate being in meetings etc with nothing to say. I feel now that I should be doing a less sort of academic/cognitive heavy job and one maybe like a care assistant or a driver etc thats more hands on stuff. That would mean Id have wasted my time and money getting my degree and masters in business/finance though. Im considering  quiting the job but nearly everyone in my life will tell me not to I know because it is such a good job. 

The people are very nice in work and the job really is a great job, great holidays, good pay etc so it's very hard to give up and my performance reviews to date havent been bad . But I can see when Im expected to do the full role that Ill have difficulties.

Another option might be to disclose the illness or just the cognitive impairments and see what they say, maybe I can have a more tailored role. Or even if they knew about the illness I would  feel less anxious about contributing little in meetings etc. Its a public service job and they do claim to be inclusive of people with disabilities. I just didnt tell them in the when starting so I wonder if that would be a problem.

Im on the lowest dose of my abilify and have switched already from Risperdal and saw no discernable change so dont think a change in medicine could help.

"I’m so tired. Can’t tell if this is happening or not I don’t know if what I am experiencing is paranoia, shitty people or if my brain is building things out of context from what it hears but almost every time I am out in public people say rude comments, creep on me (staring, making comments about my appearance or the way I behave and hold myself), or think I’m creeping on them! And it is so weird I am making the effort to only have eye contact on my friend so I don’t go looking at people or staring at others but I’ve been accused of looking at people in the corner of my eye or being a creepy lesbian when nothing I’ve done is evident to that. Then I have people making fun of my dating life when I talk about my innocent dates with cute girls and start heckling me. It’s absurd. I know lgbt topics can be a trigger to random people to eavesdrop and talk shit but why on earth should I filter myself? I’m not being vulgar or disgusting in any way. And if I tell my friends people are talking shit about me then it gets worst! The heckling gets worst but my friends only pay attention to me and not their environment so they’ve never heard anything out of the blue and I feel so distressed. 

I do live in a hick town and I am a minority. I do not think I am interesting to people in any way unless they find a random lgbt person’s life to be some form of entertainment. I have asked people if I look weird or if I do weird things but so far the consensus is that I look and act totally normal. It is possible that my town has a lot of shitty people with nothing better to do but it happening all the time is weird. I am just so upset because some of these things I hear are hurtful and homophobic and I’ve done nothing to deserve such hateful things. I just want to eat or drink something nice in public and talk to my friends and enjoy our time together. I don’t want to sit somewhere and have people bombard me with their catty behavior. 

If it is any way helpful information I am taking risperidone 2mg and Effexor for my anxiety and depression. I do not have a family history of schizophrenia. I have heard random gibberish when I haven’t slept for a long time but it wasn’t anything ever offensive. I have heard bad things when I was on the wrong medication but when it was taken out of my system then I’ve stopped hearing bad voices. I don’t hear anything mean or hateful in absolute silence or from radios or tv etc. I just hear it in loud environments where I can hear people near me (e.g. arms length away). When my mood is low these things tend to occur more often but again I don’t know if it’s my brain or just me going out more frequently to talk to my supportive friends in public when I’m upset. I am going to see my psychiatrist and tell them about what’s happening.

"Using Beta Blockers to dull sensory oversensitivity (and a question about mdma) Hey guys and gals,

I recently tried Propanolol because I thought the effect it has for people with stage fright, might also work for people with autism. It's been a week of trying it out now. I study at university and I've always had a lot of difficulty attending seminars because they are too noisy to be comfortable to me and the university is huge too so that doesn't help either. Even as a kid, I have always been very sensitive to sound.

I can say that, for me, Propanolol has really worked! Beta blockers dull the effect that adrenaline has on the body. Has anyone else here tried Beta blockers and noticed a dulling of their oversensitivities to sound, too? 

Secondly, I've been collecting data on studies on MDMA and it's potentials for treating people that have had a bad time during their younger years. As we all know, autism can have a really large impact on social bonding, especially in our younger years. MDMA apparently makes the brain produce Oxytocine which is required to create new connections in your brain for social learning and, from previous experiences in my teenage years, I can say it's extatious(?) effects can really help easing social contacts too, though I've found that going to a good concert can put me in the same state of mind so that's more of a pleasant afterthought. 

I have made some really good friends at university and at my grappling lessons, including one very  good friend that studies psychology and is, generally, the sweetest girl I've ever met and she's helped me a lot with social bonding before by setting up a systematic plan we've been working on in the past months for getting me to be more social. We've been discussing trying to use MDMA in a controlled setting with just friends to increase my bonding as I'm still very aloof with my friends sometimes and when I'm not, it just feels unnatural to me.

Here's some links for studies involving MDMA and autism or conditions which might produce similar effects to the social problems autists run into:

"Please weigh in on my unmedicated friend's condition A good friend I've had for many years has schizophrenia. Early on she would be depressed, hurt herself, etc. She went to a doctor about 5 years ago when she was around 15, but they said she was too young to be prescribed?

 Anyway, I've helped her stop cutting and check in on her every now and then. Nowadays she seems completely happy and healthy, with a little crafting business where she sculpts the hallucinations she has into things like earrings and trinkets, along with paintings of these like, benevolent beings she sees on occasion. Her art isn't disturbing or red-flaggy at all, just a but off-kilter, and fairy-like. I believe channeling her psychosis into her art has helped a ton. She seems to be coping with her condition very well and is tremendously kind and caring- one of the best humans I've ever met.

However, I recently saw a YouTube documentary about an unmedicated man suffering from severe schizophrenia, things like communicating with god, believing the CIA was after him, in and out of police stations and mental hospitals, stuff like that. I watched someone who was already pretty wacked out degrade even further until finally it ended with him living on the streets and being hit by a train- an apparent suicide.

I never want this to happen to my friend, ever. The thought of this absolute flower of a human being even possibly ending up like that shatters my heart to think about. I brought it up to her and asked her if she took anything for what she had, but she thanked me and assured me she was fine the way she was and didn't need any medication, that her depression had tapered off and she learned to live with her psychosis- even showed me some nice art she made based off a person she had hallucinated. Given all I know about her, she seems... fine. I want to believe her, and I guess I do. She looks fine, she has a good relationship, a side business, she's never violent or has outbursts of depression or anxiety, all of this of her own accord, unmedicated.

I know this was very long winded and I probably sound foolish with how I've interpreted a lot of this, but I suppose I only want to know one thing.

**Can schizophrenia be left untreated? Or will her condition gradually get worse as she gets older, independent of her coping mechanisms, no matter how fine she seems right now?**

"The domino effect... where does it end? I've messed up, mismanaged my time, taken on too much, tried to find balance and I've failed-- miserably. Why does it take me SO MUCH LONGER than most to process/do/etc.?

**Background:** 
I'm a second year masters student, who barely survived the first year of grad school unmedicated. I was diagnosed in August and I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with all these behaviours and thoughts that are negatively impacting me.

**Situation**
I had an assignment. There were four parts, I completed 2 (fully proofread and ready for submission), with the third part of them half-assed and the fourth part untouched. I went to the TA's office hours to get some help and clarification on a few things-- but because her office hours are the day before submission, I didn't have enough time to implement changes and finish on time. I asked for an extension which was received very poorly, and then I got so anxious that I struggled to reach the extension deadline. Long story short, I got the assignment submitted, but now my midterm is tomorrow and because I spent all weekend working on my assignment rather than studying-- I'm screwed for the midterm. Now I'm overwhelmed and considering asking for a deferral as I haven't studied at all. On top of this, I'm behind on marking and the students need their assignments back like last week. I don't even know how to move forward.  

I feel so much anxiety, fear, guilt, and shame around this event that I've honestly started to just shut down. The anxiety is overwhelming. Last night I was so anxious, I woke up from a deep sleep at one am because I was going to throw up. I hate throwing up so much-- the last time I threw up was 2014 when I got food poisoning. I hate throwing up so much, so for me to come so close to getting sick, due to my anxiety and fear of failure is just so shocking to me. I've only been diagnosed with ADHD and I assumed that the anxiety was just from that but now that I'm literally paralyzed... I'm not sure. 


**TL;DR** - I got an extension for my assignment--which put me behind for studying for my midterm. This domino effect gives me severe anxiety and I have spent the last two days constantly nauseous. I think I need a deferral but I'm overwhelmed with fear of stigma within the academy/department. 

I guess I have several main questions:

* do you feel like it's unfair to ask for a deferral? 

* how can I prevent this from happening again?

* do others (who have not been diagnosed with anxiety) struggle with this level of anxiety? 

* is trying to stay in academia even worth it?

* can I find a solution, or is my life going to remain in a constant state of damage control?

I haven't had that issue before, but since I was attacked 2 yrs ago (and successfuly fled the attacker, fortunatelly) by a man, I have been living in celibacy. 
I used to have this crippling fear around men after that, like my limbs would feel cut by fear and I avoided them. Thanks to therapy, I no longer feel like that, however, a part of it shows up if I find someone sexually attractive.
Has anyone dealt with this? I would like to overcome it, but I get scared and just act totally disinterested and aloof.",ptsd,ptsd
"In need of advice from adults on the spectrum. (Concerning school placement) I have a very bright 7 year old son who attends school in General education.  My child has a lot of anxiety and sensory issues especially when it comes to noises.  At the school Christmas party we went to a couple of weeks ago, I was shocked to learn that they kept headphones on him the entire day.  He has never needed that before, and I was honestly surprised that no one had notified me, because they have been really awesome so far.  My question is, should I keep him in general education with headphones on, even though he seems to have a lot of anxiety and meltdowns? Or should I move him to a smaller classroom where it might not be as noisy and less stressful for him?   My heart wants him to be where he is most comfortable, but I also want him to be around his peers so he can learn how to interact with them.  I thought I would ask the adult autistics on here because you can give me more of a window into what it's like for my child.  Or at least something similar, (I know that everyone is different.)  I really can only guess as to what he's thinking because he is verbally delayed.  Also thank you for all you do for the parents of this sub.  I truly would be lost without you.  ",autism,autism

"Medication Effects and Hyperfocus - Wondering Whether Others Can Relate I'm not on an exactly low dose for adhd. in fact, it consists of two different medications (IR) at upper dosages. 

It feels like l-amp (Vyvanse) controls my mood and impulses in the morning along with improved focus - else I'm all over the place, my mind remains a nonabsorbent sponge which I can't remember or learn at all and have issues even taking care of myself. Hell, it's a chore to brush my teeth daily, and d-amp (Adderall or Dexedrine) makes me focused and controls irritation, frustration and impulsivity and ""giveupness"". I feel like medications for me improve uncontrollable emotions most, focus coming in at second, and then motivation. Another good part is during class instead of thinkin about women or other distracting things, it numbs that part and can take notes and absorb *some* of the things talked about in class.

Tho, sometimes I notice that sometimes it feels like I've gone like autistic on a task - no offense or ablism intended, and may become too detailed in completing a task - it has to be done completely properly and satisfactory to its standards. Normally unmedicated, I prob wouldn't even start the said task to begin with as I just *hate* the thought of ""there's TOO MUCH of it"" or ""this is gonna take a long time"". Other problems are sleeping and sleep cycle. I work terrible shifts - well until I can finish internship applications which I'm still putting off.

"I'm the alcoholic. Do I deserve respect, or should I expect to be judged and criticized by a partner? Make no mistake, I am a drunk.  I'm 37 and have drank since 18.  I've had periods of sobriety, none longer than 1.5 years.  I've been to rehab; I've attended countless AA meetings; I've taken responsibility; I don't blame anyone but myself and I don't make excuses.  I am an alcoholic and can't stop drinking. 

I married my partner 6 years ago.  When I met him, I had *just* started drinking again after a several month stint of sobriety.  We had fun, partied, went to clubs, etc.  I drank to excess then, and worse now.  Over the years, I've tried to explain alcoholism to him.  In short, this included a book on understanding the alcoholic family member, bringing him to a couple AA meetings (he didn't have much interest), hundreds of discussions (which typically ended in arguments), and exposure to other alcoholics with their collective wisdom.   He continues to conclude that I am weak and I have a choice to stop ""if I wanted to"".  My interpretation is that he simply does not understand the power alcoholism holds over me.  I tell him that I'd love to stop drinking, that I know how detrimental it is, that I realize it could have devastating effects on my health and our relationship.  ""So just stop"", is the response I get.  

Obviously the dynamics in our relationship are much more complex than I can detail in a post.  So, understand that he is a loving person, I am a loving person, he always looks out for my best interest and vice versa.  It is a healthy relationship with the glaring exception of my alcoholism.  

Aside from the obvious answer that I should stop drinking and that will solve all my problems, **here is my reality:** 

* He likes to go out and have cocktails, and wants me to have cocktails (albeit only one or two) and gets furious with me when I have more.  Every time, I explain that I can''t.  He doesn't believe this.
* I drink at home for untold reasons.  He tells me I am weak.  He tells me that it is my choice (is it?).  He gives me ultimatums, for which I reply that I understand.
   * I am a happy drunk - I drink to get away.  I go into my own world, and watch videos and smile, laugh.  I never get angry, and rarely get sad.  Any confrontation is almost always when he berates me with judgement and callous comments that I can only assume are driven by his inability to comprehend this disease, not by a fault in his character.
* I am born from a family of alcoholics - so that's fun.  He throws that in my face whenever I go to visit family.  ""Your mother will let you drink, your father likes to drink, have fun, don't come home"".  
* Oddly, he discusses our lifestyle in a hurtful manner, and this one really makes me bewildered:
   * When there's cause for argument, he condescendingly states that he is under my control because I am the breadwinner.  I have a good job that pays very well.  I NEVER tell him what to spend or how to spend it, but he will bring this up as if I do.  His profession is difficult and comes and goes.  I am always supportive as money is not an issue, so there is no reason for me to critical of his earnings.  It just doesn't factor with me, but it DOES for him when he wants to make me feel bad about my drinking.  I don't understand the association.

"Day 3 after my final bout of alcoholism Not sure where to begin, I just want to speak my mind on the past year of drinking. I have only been to the ER twice in my life and the first time was for a broken arm. The second was this past weekend after what I only feel was more horrific than the thought of death. 

About a year ago I experienced the most agonizing feeling of dread and anxiety after a 3 day bender. I woke up in the middle of the night with a ""strange"" hangover. My entire body felt numb and my head was foggy (way more than normal). I felt a panic overcome me, so some dumb logic in my head said to ""drink water and run a mile"". I did this, got off the treadmill, and walked to the shower. Every step felt as if I was distant in my mind  controlling my own legs. This caused more panic. I sat in the shower, water running, and began shaking. 

I started drinking water by the gallon. I felt massive hopelessness, like I was out of my own body. I was confused and my mind felt as if it was melting. I had my SO take me to the nearest ER, but didn't go in. We waited outside, the symptoms of whatever I went through lessened, then we went home.

Over the next few days, I stayed sober. However, there were aftershocks. My confusion felt strong for weeks after, the brain fog stayed heavy, and anxiety worsened. I moderated my drinking several days after, and was ""fine"" up until this weekend, where I went overboard like a year ago. I woke up Sunday morning to that same hell I experienced almost a year ago. This time however, I made it all the way into the ER. 

After Ativan and a IV bag, I began to feel better. The semi norm returned and my conciousness pulled closer from the void back into my head. This was decidedly the day I will truly go sober. I have made many disappointing and terrible decisions during this alcoholic life I've lead over several years. But sitting here, typing this out, and starting my new and true story with give me the faith and hope I need to regain my life, as well as the motivation to make everyday a challenge that is winnable. 

I pray that I can regain my cognitive faculties, a clear mind free of this ""fog"", lessened anxiety.",alcoholism,alcoholism
"Arrested and undiagnosed My friend has been experiencing what we believe but has not been diagnosed as schizophrenia with paranoia. It has been a tough six or so months and things have escalated. His delusions/beliefs have him convinced he is being targeted by a growing network of 200+ people using electronic torture and EMFs to frame him for all manner of things. He now believes my husband is being blackmailed into helping this network torture and frame him. His girlfriend is one of our best friends and she is blown apart by all of this. I have read the sticky post and have forwarded her the information, but I digress.

I’m posting because last night, our friend was arrested for criminal trespass. It’s the second time in the last few months that he has been taken in for this charge and it all revolves around the place he used to rent - the place he believes this all started. 

My question and reason for posting is ultimately trying to gain an understanding of what an arrest could mean for him. His last arrest, his behavior was more muted. Since then he has progressed significantly into his beliefs and has taken to a lot of behaviors that, frankly, scare us a little bit. 

He has not been diagnosed. He refuses to go to the doctor and we are not able to get through to him. I do not understand if the county can force him into observation or medical treatment. I do not know if this would be good or bad. Mostly I’m just trying to prep for what he needs when he is released. I realize that without an official diagnosis (and even with one), we may be of absolutely no use at all. But I’d appreciate if anyone of you have experienced a similar situation would be willing to share insight from any perspective in such a situation.

"New Here! Have a question :) Hey all! Just found this Subreddit today. My finance suffers from suspected PTSD due to childhood sexual abuse along with some other diagnosed mental illnesses (Narcissistic Personality Disorder, OCD, Bipolar Disorder, and one diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder but we’re not as sure about that one), and I had a question regarding his behavior I’m hoping someone might be able to help shed some light on. I’ve been especially concerned lately because there are some days where he seems like a completely different person. Some days he’s relatively cheerful and alert and seems normal and we have normal conversations. But some days he is so out of it that he can barely walk or stand without assistance. His speech can get slurred, he can sometimes fall, his driving skills suffer greatly. It’s like he’s heavily intoxicated, even though I know he couldn’t possibly be. Worst of all, he seems to have no idea he’s even like that. Whenever I ask him if he’s okay he just tells me he’s tired, and when I try to explain how he’s acting he has no idea what I’m talking about. It’s very scary for me and I don’t know what I can do to help other than keep him from falling and be comforting and get him to bed when necessary. I can’t discern any specific causes other than sometimes these days correlate to when he is tired or upset, but not always. Another note is that on the days where he is like this he seems more likely to wet the bed at night, which happens from time to time. Has anyone else watched someone experience this or experience it themselves? Is it potentially a symptom of PTSD or could it be because of any number of things? Any ideas on what I can do to help? I’m going to ask my therapist some questions about it during our next session, but I also wanted to hear from people who have experiences PTSD themselves or are close to people who have. Sorry, I know I just wrote a whole wall of text so I hope this all makes sense. If you have any clarification questions please don’t hesitate to ask, I’ll answer as best I can. ",ptsd,ptsd

"Need Help for my Sister Hello Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

My Sister suffered from brief reactive psychosis  2 years ago. Her symptoms included : Someone is tracking her, people are plotting to take her out of her workplace, There is camera in bathroom, Words are jumbled such that previously they meant something else and now they are meaning something else. She was 27 then and just got a new job. It was a shift job, she was in IT Security and something she got after a facing a lot of pressure, social isolation and not having a great health. Before she showed symptoms she complained of headache and her face was full of boils, she also liked a guy and that guy was just friendly, but she started considering him as boyfriend, getting insecure. She had She told him her feeling only to find that the guy never contacted. She was given riseperdone and was cured within a month though the treatment went on for a year. She was on neocalm plus which she stopped taking or took ""as per need"" because she didnt want to be on medicines. We thought, cool, she is cured now. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was very happy go lucky before this and after 6 month of taking medicines. But slowly she became depressive. Her depression was so slow that it was almost non understood by us. I felt she is not able to get on with her life and still stuck on same past. We tried talking to her, but she didn't take a step forward. She couldn't understand a word out of it. She then started becoming unresponsive and everytime I spoke to her I felt it was a ""lecture"" and not a ""discussion"". She sucked the whole energy out of me and my words didn;t even hit her. We all felt that way.

&amp;#x200B;

This slowly turned into occasionally making something said by others, she said that it was her experience not theirs. This slowly turned to same things, of people laughing at her, she randomly asked family members where are they leaving her? Is she a &lt;INSERT ANY WORD whose talks are going on eg: football, terrorist&gt;. Now she has auditory hallucinations and she frequently sees things which are not there. like why am I crying?(when I am not), why are you talking this way(when we are talking exactly the way we used to). Her sleep was abnormal too. She used to wake up every 2 hours saying why are people making fun of her, are you leaving. Me my father my mother we all slept together during this period. It was too scary for me to handle.  She was takne to doctor where he said she is experiencing mild schizophrenia. I was so shaken by this statement and I got scared for all her symptoms and her future.

Her medicines:

1. Piracetam(5ml syrup)
2. Risperdone(0.5 mg)
3. Escnx(10 mg) (as she had depression I guess)
4. B vitamins

&amp;#x200B;

My question:

1. I really want to know if this is schizophrenia and if it is then how long the treatment goes.  Her doctor said it will be a long treatment 2-3 years
2. Why did it come back to her? She stopped her medicines esp. Piracetam and escnx for 3 weeks. After that she got the second one. Does this happen to people when they stop medication? 
3. Are there any successful cases where they became OK after the course of medicines and are leading normal lives ? I am more scared for her future.
4. She is devoid of goal, how can I enrich her life again with things which make her busy/?  How do you guys live your life with enthusiasm? How to find meaning?
5. Anything I should know prepare for future? Articles listed on google are too scary to read. I found normality in the group.

"Nature of Reality Trigger warning as this type of thinking or contemplation may not be healthy for everyone. I know it certainly probably isn't for myself and I have no diagnosis of a psychotic disorder of any kind at this juncture. 

I have dealt with anxiety for going on a decade after dealing with a traumatic LSD trip. I think I experienced psychosis after the trip as I ""Tripped"" for about 24 hours or so before finally getting some sleep. It has shaped my personality, my life's path, everything. And though I have had good times, maybe even years, for the most part there has been an intense anxiety and sense of existential dread that has characterized my life since that point. Self medicating with alcohol and distractions carried me through until recently I dealt with the loss of my mother at a young age and it has all flaired up again.

I deal with intrusive suicidal thoughts that I believe may be characteristic of OCD, though I have only been diagnosed with GAD officially. However every day is a new challenge. Some days it's depression. Other days it's general anxiety about things. And then others I have what I believe may be delusional thoughts. Feelings, more so than beliefs. And often times worse at night or when I am in a ruminating cycle, spending a lot of time reading up on esoteric things, eastern philosophy, spirituality, nature of reality, other people's ocd or psychotic symptoms, etc. The central fear that runs through this all though is a fear that I will become psychotic, or lose touch with reality. Sometimes there is less anxiety than others and I almost just accept it. Not necessarily the thoughts, but the state of being and I am somewhat calm. This also disturbs me because I have sort of accepted that I may be dealing with a type of OCD rather than the onset of something like Schizophrenia or BiPolar.

The thoughts go like this;

When I tripped on LSD, everything seemed unreal. That cause and effect did not operate like they do in 'normal every day reality' we have come to believe in in western society. Synchronicities happened even on my trip and for a long time thereafter. I saw numbers frequently, or people did weird things and it tripped me out and gave me a profound sense of depersonalization/derealization. Now I am experiencing similar thoughts and situations again during this 'flair up' and am questioning the very nature of reality. A lot of times it's a sort of solipsistic belief that everyone is an 'actor' in my movie. I don't necessarily believe that to be the case, it just feels that way. Especially with people I grow close to. Such as my significant other. That somehow we are destined to be together. These are the type of thoughts I have. Or that my therapist is merely telling me what I want to hear. I still find grounding in reality based on novelty, learning new things, etc. But there is still this nagging doubt that reality is merely an extension of my own consciousness. And what makes that even more complicated is that eastern ideals of spirituality affirm this to be true!

So while dealing with these things form the perspective of having a mental disorder, I also am grappling with philosophical and spiritual ideals that go hand and hand with these very thoughts. Like, is everything someone is experiencing in terms of psychosis a glimpse into an alternate or just as real 'reality'? I'm really not smart enough to talk about all of this eloquently, but I am a seeker and feel like I can't just ignore it all and go back to normal living. I know if I stop ruminating and thinking about all this and checking by reading stuff online constantly it is a thought that will not continue to grow and flourish. But I seek certainty that I know I cannot have. And I think that is what fuels all of our OCD. It's hard when the very nature of it all is based on huge existential/basis of reality questions that even the greatest minds in history have grappled with.

The last thing I want is to go into a full blown episode where I am out of touch with reality. How do you come to terms with this stuff? Do you just listen to western medicine practitioners and the laws of cause and effect and accept that people who experience psychosis are purely delusional?

Some other 'thoughts', symptoms, whatever you want to call them;

\-Faces looking weird or foreign, may be a form of DP/DR

\-Fearing the pursuit of eastern spirituality as in my western protestant upbringing would make me believe that it is satanic and it's a path that will lead me to death/insanity/hell/etc.

\-Feeling like people like my therapists are playing a 'role' telling me what I want to hear or something

\-Feeling like my GF is just another player and I'm destined to be with her and if I leave her I'll be embarking on another path to doom

\-When I get to vulnerable with people like therapists I disassociate and everything seems unreal

\-Just feeling a general disconnect from those and everything around me. Even my memories sometimes seem almost unreal, foggy, or just colored by something mildly sinister

\-Fear that reality is just my own consciousness, solipsistic ideas like this terrify me

\-Seems like I'm on high alert always looking for little 'glitches' in my reality, still see synchronicities like numbers or coincidences which are like reality 'hiccups'. These aren't hallucinations, perhaps only confirmation bias is at work here but what if it's not? This is what other people who experience psychosis experience too. They're not hallucinating. What if it isn't just seeing patterns and they are in fact in tune with something else?

\-Anxiety can often be a trigger for my suicidal intrusive thoughts, making the connection that somehow my body is telling me something subconsciously or something. Often times it's fueled by a profound urge to want to escape.

\-Can I 'think' may way into something like Schizophrenia? If I continue down this path will it develop? I know that might be offensive at first glance to someone who is struggling with Schizophrenia, but isn't that the very nature of the brain, we create our reality with our thoughts? 

\-Feel out of touch with myself, I look weird in the mirror or in photos. Generally don't feel very embodied, like I'm always overthinking or looking at a screen

\-Thoughts go every which way, as creative as if I kill myself I'll be enlightened or stupid shit like that which I know is proposterous so usually don't even entertain them. But they do enter my brain and I feel like I'm always battling my thoughts just to stay sane.

I was diagnosed with C-PTSD during the seven(!) years I spent on and off cobbling together what is essentially a useless degree which I learned nothing from. I got really mentally ill, PTSD was the big issue, I couldn't work, blah. 

I've been in a relationship for nine years which we started very young and carefree and, as time has gone on, it's become more and more obvious that I am just not cut out for being a real partner to someone. I'm good at being a thing away from the world, not so good when you want to be in the world. He ran out of patience, and now we're just in this pattern where we don't know what to do, get frustrated and angry with each other, never know whether to break up or stay or whatever. 

I can't keep a job, I got a job two years ago after being unemployed for years and I was thrilled. I was doing subtitles for TV and I was really enjoying feeling like I knew something, but after about four months one set of managers started telling me I was doing terribly, I kept getting marked down for missing characters or forgetting pieces of admin, and I had to leave before they sacked me. I haven't worked since and I cannot even get people to interview me. My CV is a trainwreck of part-time or failed jobs and I couldn't even tell you what I want to do with myself. Every time I commit to something I panic and fail - I've just started a well-regarded distance degree and find myself in the same patterns of fearing work, not working, and then when I do read things realising that I am not learning anything. 

Last year I got my psychiatrist to give me an evaluation, and I honestly wish I never had. My bf was sceptical of her as she continually forgot why I was being treated and would need me to repeat that I had PTSD from abuse, and she also advised me not to get off anti-psychotics before I started my last job, which I had wanted to do as I felt I would be too foggy and fail on them (which I did.)

Anyway, I went along with my mum as the psych wanted a childhood history. I had never considered that I had ADHD except I kept seeing women online talking about things that I had always felt were just me, like I was just a stupid and sensitive person who had an ego far above my ability. I felt positive and like it would be difficult to confront this, but that I had to. 

Well, at one point in my interview she aksed me if I was able to stay in my seat at school and generally not be badly behaved, and I said yes. She then tapped her pen on her pad, closed it over, and said to me, ""I can tell you right now you don't have ADHD."" I was angry and devastated, I tried arguing with her but I didn't feel confident saying to her that, as far as I knew, that was an outdated and ill-informed interpretation of ADHD. I'm sure you know what it's like when a psychiatrist has any inkling that you might have researched your own health though, automatic problem. She also told me that inattentive ADHD is ""not a thing"" in the UK.

She suggested to me that I had a neurosis from before school about ""wanting to be a good girl"" and that I should get psychotherapy for that. It made me furious and I completely disengaged from psychiatry. I had already got myself off venlafaxine and quetiapine, which had made me so ill I was referred to a neurologist and for an MRI because the side effects were so appalling, and I just couldn't deal with people telling me that I'm wrong and I just have yet more shit wrong with me I haven't realised. 

I guess I'm really just coming here because it's been nearly two years now since I started thinking this, and I'm no further forward. Nobody in my family or my boyfriend understands how I feel, they get angry and frustrated at me and nobody depends on me. I'm devastated by the state of my life, my lack of achievement, and the state of my relationships. I have no friends, I'm 31, no job, no achievements to speak of except if you go back to school. I'm terrified the psych was right and I don't have ADHD, despite me having screamingly long lists of symptoms and traits, and that I'm just useless as a person. My bf tries to say to me that if I was just lazy I wouldn't be so devastated by where I am, and I guess that's true but I just feel so awful about myself. I've just spent my twenties ping-ponging  between being an impulsive and hurtful mess or sitting not talking to anyone and ignoring deadlines coming at me. I try to talk to my mum or bf about it and they always end up frustrated with me. The only people that seem to get it are my stepdad, who thinks he has mild ADHD, and my dad, who I am convinced has very bad ADHD which he's been forced to manage himself. 

TL;DR, my twenties were a mess and I'm suffering the fallout now. Totally hopeless about the future, psych says I don't have ADHD because I was well-behaved at school (except of course when I didn't understand things and acted out and people just got stern with me until I was small and quiet again) and I just feel so alone in the world. How do I get out of this cycle? Am I ever going to feel okay about myself? Can I ever be person people want around? ",adhd,adhd

It’s been going on for years now. I will also have full conversations while I slowly wake up, thats hard to explain but its kinda like my body is talking and giving my brain time to wake up and be alert without anyone knowing I was asleep.
On top of that, even though I sleep it isn’t restful. I haven’t had nightmares (or really any dreams) in years now, so thats not the issue.
I don’t know any way to deal with this. I am so exhausted throughout the day but I get a full nights sleep every night. Sleeping meds knock me out through the next day so I cant take them.

"First Time Taking Any Kind of Amphetamine (Vyvanse) Analysis. I took a 50mg Vyvanse the other day after being prescribed and this is basically what I experienced from my first time taking any kind of amphetamine for the matter. So I took it at about 10:20 am and had a class at 11. I was actually surprised because it was a real gradual come up, at around 10:50 on my way to class I could start to tell It was working and I felt just a natural sense of clarity, I felt literally normal. That's the best way I could describe it. After my class at about 12, the clarity was even more profound and I felt focused, motivated, and happy. To really put it in perspective, especially for me, I felt normal and alive, I couldn't stop thinking about how this is how I really wish I could feel all the time or this is how I should feel. My mind wasn't rushing with thoughts, I was direct with everything I did, I wasn't worried about what anyone else was doing or overthinking myself, I could focus on what I was doing and what I needed to do. After class I did some homework and got pretty into it for about an hour and I was focused and determined while doing it. Then I decided to stop and do something else but all the while I felt good and alive. However, I didn't really get ""lost in a trance"" reading necessarily or doing homework as some people report, especially with adderall (I don't know if that was because it's a different drug and/or I didn't take enough mg). Besides that, I would say strong effects lasted around 4-5 hours and then after that it was a subtle come down. Overall, I think I had a great experience for my first time and could go to bed no problem that same night. 

EDIT 1: I also forgot to mention me and my ex-girlfriend are going through a pretty tough time together and for some reason I just did not want to fight with her and I just didn't care about arguing (which is completely the opposite because I'm trying to make things right)...I just wanted to continue being happy and didn't want anything to impede that. So that's interesting to me.

EDIT 2: I forgot to mention in one of my classes later in the day I felt slightly irritable. I felt as though everyone around me was ""coughing"" and I was trying to do work and multiple people were coughing loud as hell (at least it seemed like it to me) and I wanted to tell them to shut up.  

EDIT 3: Just wanted to add that while walking places or to class, I felt very euphoric, so much so that I just wanted to go up to strangers and tell them how happy I was lol (didn’t actually). Things were more clear to me and I felt a sense of vibrance.

EDIT 4: I didn’t have that many actual one on one interactions while on it just because I was studying for some of the time and in class some of the time as well. But I will say that when I did talk to someone one on one I would normally react with slight nervousness fidgetiness, rapid thoughts and anxiousness, and it would be harder for me to have a good conversation. But while on it all of that was gone and I stood there and talked with confidence and had pretty clear straightforward thoughts. It definitely helped in that aspect from what I could tell.

"Are these delusions I should be concerned about? So for my entire life I have things that could be delusions. I am bipolar but a lot of this doesn’t really seem immediately related to that. How concerning is this? 


When I was six I believed that the guy who build my house was a bad doctor who had died in the house and was haunting it. One time I went into a closet and paper towels fell on me and I thought it was the doctor throwing them at me. Another time when I stayed up late on New Years I saw a white mist on the shape of a person walk down the stairs and down the hall, which I believed to be the doctor. 


When I was eight I fake confessed my sins at church and everyone praised me thinking I actually confessed. I felt super guilty and thought that God was super angry with me and was going to punish me and my family. I stayed up several nights after that crying and apologizing to God. Also for a while after that I constantly felt Gods presence and like someone was watching me but that person was God. 


When I was ten I watched a show called “I Shouldn’t be Alive” where people tell their story of being trapped in the wilderness. In one episode these people are trapped on a raft and one guy drinks seawater and goes crazy and jumps into the water and gets eaten by sharks. I believed that the ghost of that guy was haunting me and was mad at me for watching the show which disrespected his memory. 


Also some time around this time I hallucinated the sensation of a giant millipede squirming in my bed. I also thought that I may have some small power of prophecy, somewhat as a joke, idk how much I actually believed this but more than none. 


When I was twelve I watched The Truman Show and did not immediately realize that it was fiction. My dad quickly told me that it was, but I was still afraid after that that there were cameras hidden around the house or in the mirrors. I tried to act very normal in front of the mirror incase anyone was watching. 


When I was sixteen I accidentally saw a photo of a dead girl (a dead decomposing body) on the Internet. Putting that picture on the internet seemed like an extremely disrespectful thing to do to the girl since the way she died was far from flattering. Similar to the “I Shouldn’t be alive” incident I had the feeling that her ghost was haunting me for disrespecting her by seeing the image. I didn’t fully believe  this was true I just had the creepy feeling of it. 


I also have had a couple incidents w hallucinations, audio, visual, along with smells. This seemed to be a bipolar mixed episode which gave me the hallucinations. I was on an antipsychotic for a while and it seems to have gone away, even since I’ve stopped. 


I also get really paranoid when I have panic attacks, like believing that my parents are planning to lock me up, or that my mom hates me so much I have to hide from her.

"Girlfriend has Schizoaffective I recently moved my gf in who has SA and isn't on medication. It has been a rough time, to say the least. She behaves like a child.

So if I joke and say something dumb like I think I'll keep your dog, she'll burst into tears and start wailing, till I tell her I was only joking. She says that I cannot under any circumstances joke about books because they mean too much to her. If I say something about the plot of a book she will go off the deep end and lose it. 

She doesn't know any social cues so she doesn't understand how to talk to people or interact with people. If we stop at a gas station and there is people there she says she can't go in because she's scared of people and she doesn't want people looking at her. When people walk by her she winces and curls up like they are going to hit her. She also has a phobia of leaving voice mails. She refuses to leave a voice  mail with the doctor because it scares her to know that her voice is being recorded and someone has it. I joked with her one day and said that I thought she left me a voice mail once and she went berserk demanding I delete it right then and there if it was true. 

I don't know what to do because it's like living with a child with a temper who has all these phobias. She has no friends at all because she says that she doesn't know how to make them.

"Sims 4 giving me weird motivation I bought sims 4 out of boredom and it got me out of binge mode. I made a sim that looks like me, a sim that would look like me if I was thinner, and a sim that I desperately want to look like but will never look like. For the two sims that look like me, I also selected the traits glutton, gloomy, and clumsy. So I started playing and my sims’ lives started mirroring my own life. The fat sim would constantly be crying because of loneliness (I kept her in the house for days and didn’t let her talk to people much. Literally, she started talking to plants for social interaction). But the 2 skinny sims never had that problem and I realized I was more social when playing them. I also had them form romantic relationships with other sims, but I kept the fat sim alone because I felt like she would look weird with normal sized sims. I even rejected a date because I just felt she didn’t belong in a relationship. Overall, I treated her more poorly than I would my other sims... not intentionally, but I was thinking about it today and realized how unconsciously biased I was because of their weights. But she’s also my most successful sim career-wise (she’s a style influencer/beauty guru) and I put a ton of effort into leveling her skills in comparison to my other sims.

But she’s so fat” even though I know it’s just a frickin game. Idk where I’m going with this...

Her mom didn’t have schizophrenia, and she never knew her father. However, she had me when she was 16, and after that regularly engaged in dangerous activities, such as frequent LSD use, PCP use, Stim use, etc. She also did smoke weed extremely often, and studies now are showing that smoking weed chronically or at an early age can affect the onset of the disorder.

So with that being said, was cannabis a part of your daily routine? Did you have a schizophrenic parent yourselves and you resorted to things like marijuana to cope, and eventually ended up with the disorder yourself?

&amp;#x200B;

I have had PTSD since I was about 7 yrs old.  It took me into my thirties to realize what it was because I couldn't remember the traumatic event and my mother never told me what happened, she just told me I was crazy.  The memory began to surface when I was grieving from miscarriage.   I checked the story with my aunt and she confirmed it.  The memory was that my dad was drunk and threatening to kill me, my sister, my mother, and my mother's fiance with a gun.  I still only remember fragments, but I can tell you it was terrifying to me at that age.

Recently, this is what happened.  

Our beloved cat passed on last week, it was a very peaceful natural death, and last night we were watching a movie called Rachel Getting Married which has some very intense themes.  I had seen it before and there was a scene where a woman confronts her mother and they get into a physical fight. The mother reminds me of mine.

 I started having a flashback of waking up screaming some time after the trauma with my father and doing this on a regular basis as a little kid.  My mother's solution was to come in, slap my face, scream at me, and finally cover my mouth and sit on me to the point I felt like I was suffocating.  I honestly think if she could get away with it, she would have smothered me to death.  I think I was an embarrassment to her.  She has narcissistic traits.  I vaguely remembered this before this flashback, but it always seemed muted, gauzy, and far away.

Any way, last night I had this flashback in the living room right where our kitty passed.  Weird.  I start to wonder if going through the grieving process can leave someone with their guard down and some of these memories come up.  

I am doing ok, but still horrified at my mom.  We have been no contact for about a year for other reasons.  This just confirms for me how toxic the environment growing up was.  Thanks for listening.  Telling my story really helps.",ptsd,ptsd

"From gifted to autistic I’m a mom of an 11yo daughter. When she was very little, she was bright, happy, loving, cuddly, funny, well-mannered, and full of empathy. She also had a speech delay, and received therapy via Early Intervention until age 3, then private speech therapy until age 10.  

By 1st grade, she had some issues keeping up with schoolwork and had a tough time holding a pencil. Our pediatrician ordered a full neuropsychological eval, which was done at age 7 - right before entering 2nd grade. The doctor concluded that she had dysgraphia, a bit of anxiety, and an IQ of 131. We immediately started private OT therapy, which continued until age 10.

After evaluating CoGAT and MAP test scores, our school district invited her to join the gifted classroom beginning in 4th grade. However, by the end of 5th grade she began falling behind in her studies. She started 6th grade this fall, and it feels disastrous. I asked the pediatrician for another neuropsych eval, and I just met with the psychologist to discuss his findings. I’m now in a bit of shock.

He diagnosed inattentive ADHD, to which I agree. Then he said she has autism. *What?* He went on to say that since she’s struggling to get her homework done on time (which I blame on ADHD) that we may want to consider bumping her from the gifted classroom into a gen ed room, plus get writing assistance from a reading teacher - or perhaps a qualified special ed teacher, depending on our school’s resources. Oh, and she’ll need writing therapy and ABA therapy every week. *What?* He also said her IQ score dropped 14 points, saying maybe her test at age 7 wasn’t accurate. *What?*

I am so confused. She had an autistic boy in her 2nd &amp; 3rd grade classrooms, and their behaviors are nothing alike. She just finished the winter MAP testing and scored well above average, plus her Lexile reading level is now 1600 (average is 1000 for her age; she’s at college level.) 

I’m having a hard time understanding how a child that scores so high on tests would be better suited back in a standard classroom. I also am having trouble agreeing with this diagnosis, but then I tell myself that I’m just in denial. I haven’t yet talked to my daughter (or her teachers) about any of this.

"I need help talking to an autistic roommate about health. Ok so I have an autistic roomate mid 20s. He is increasingly morbidly obese and I think pre diabetic. I'm not positive about the prediabetes but he has the symptomes, most notably the neck and joint rashes, he needs to see a doctor and check. He actually has active weekends (larping), but he eats by my estimation 6-8 thousand calories a day when i try and track it. The raw sugar intake is an issue in itself, he is going through a 1lb bag of sugar ~weekly. He heaps it in every drink even if it is already something high in sugar like pop. 6-8 continuous hours a day (sans bio breaks) at the kitchen table every day, youtubing, scripting(stimming)? and intermittently eating/drinking, is the general behaviour.

My SO tried to talk to him about it once and he raged (meltdown?) to the point she cried (you're not my mom etc), I still feel like I should try myself because it is honestly just watching someone kill themselves and you could say it is not my business, but if I don't try there is nobody else and it kinda isn't his fault either. *From my google fu obesity is supposed to be an autism linked problem because of difficulty communicating and the impulse/sensory stuff, but the strategies I found always assume you`re a parent or guardian. This is why I'm reaching out. I can't physically change his diet or cart him to a doctor, I need a subtler way to push him to self parent or get help that does not backfire and I don't even know what to google to find those answers.*

We have free healthcare here and he has long term disability, so cost isn't an issue. He might listen to a doctor if I can get him there? What I'd say to a non autistic person would be something like ""hey, I think you should go get a blood test"" or ask ""has anybody ever talked to you about calories?"", but are there coaching resources or a tack I could take here tailored to autism?

"Autism Scientific Research &amp; Treatment I am interested in the research surrounding Autism and autoimmune disorders. I've learned quite a bit of new information over the last few weeks researching. Here are some interesting things I've been putting together:

1. ASD may be a blend of neurological damage through autoimmune or physical factors
2. A mother's nutrition does have an impact
3. The father's nutrition does have an impact
4. Low Vitamin D correlates with higher rates of ASD
5. MTHFR genetic mutations correlates with higher rates of ASD
6. Abnormal gut microbiome correlates with higher rates of ASD
7. Some babies experience direct triggers from vaccinations that tip them over the edge or invoke ASD
8. Mercury may cause ASD, but safe levels may be different depending on genetics
9. Autoimmune disorders have increased significantly over the last 30 years alongside ASD
10. Glysophate, herbicides, insecticides, pesticides correlate with ASD,  potential impact on gut?
11. Breast feeding for longer periods may reduce the risk of ASD or symptoms
12. Low IGF is correlated with ASD
13. Chelation therapy may help ASD
14. Candida / Fungal overgrowth may impact ASD
15. Gut therapy may help ASD
16. The brain develops 80% by age 3, and 90% by age 5. ASD treatment is the most important during this time

"Part of being schizophrenic is (something) trying to take away your ability to choose what you believe Your head was a safe spot to believe whatever you wanted your whole life. A place you could think about your own ideas or other peoples. A happy place where thoughts are just thoughts. Thinking about whatever you wanted, hearing your own voice in your head.

Suddenly there's another voice in your head that's not yours, putting ideas in your head that cause you to feel different.  If you believe that voice.

If it's a bad voice in your head, it'll want you to feel fear, paranoia, trapped, helpless, annoyed. I believe it gets stronger the more you believe it. The voice, and your feelings.

How to defeat this bad voice so it no longer controls how I feel? Well we got to make sure we know why it's there.  Think about all the things it causes you to feel, it doesn't go away after you feel that way. It persists. It's there for control over how you feel. If you didn't believe in the voice would you feel paranoid? Would you feel scared? If you believe you are weak by the voice, isn't that what it would want you to believe? So it maintains it's control over you by what you believe. Isn't that something every schizophrenic has, a **belief** that something not normal is happening. 

What if a schizophrenic has the power to manifest his/her beliefs? At the same time ""something"" is fighting for control of what you believe? To keep you in the weakest position.

Believe you are strong. Believe that whatever's thrown at you, you get stronger. Believe that bad voice is just a tool for you to get stronger.

Make that bad voice suffer, don't let it make you suffer. It came to you. You didn't come to it. It's a tool. A tool to overcome fears that just exist in your head!

That bad voice that I had conversations with in my head all day long, that use to tell me to burn, that said it was Satan, went away the less I believed it. In the end, I believe it was my brain attacking me, and me defeating it by putting it in a position of less power. I put that voice down to be more pathetic than me with sound logic. Eventually I just called it bad thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

 I transformed my belief. I have control in what I believe in. Believe in yourself. Don't give away all your power. Even a simple belief that the voices will always be there puts you in a less powerful position.

I no longer hear voices.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"I am so frustrated and feel so alone. ADVICE PLEASE!!!!
I was diagnosed in 2009 when I was 28 with ADHD and put on Adderall XR 20 mg.  It was like a haze lifted and I could see clearly.  All those years of wondering what the hell was wrong with me, (asked by myself and people close to me) was answered.   It didn’t make my life perfect, but I could actually stay on task.  My house wasn’t spotlessly clean, but I didn’t have to fight with myself to do the dishes.  I was able to keep appointments, help my kids with school work and plan my wedding.  I didn’t feel like I was such a failure at everything.  In 2014 my dose was increased to 40 mg, doctor just suggested I had built up a tolerance.  I ended up needing a new Doctor since we moved.  Somewhere in between 2014 and 2016 I started taking more and more of my meds, gaining weight and spinning out of control.  I ended up abusing them and physically addicted.  I’m trying to make this short.  I went through treatment and have been off of them for a year now.   Last year I started going to a new Dr. (the old one just wanted to increase my doses, obviously that wasn’t going to work) I was completely honest with my new dr. about the abuse to which he prescribed non stimulant meds.  I was on Strattera over the summer and ended up really depressed and miserable.  Went off of the Strattera and he suggested I go to Mental Health professionals.  Which I have done and have seen a Nurse there.  She put me on Wellbutrin three months ago.  I went back yesterday, told her how I am just miserable.  My house is in shambles, I might feel motivated to do something, but when I go to start doing it, I just feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start.  I try the stuff I used before I was diagnosed, like just doing a little at a time.  But it isn’t working.  I’m back to being tongue tied, rambling on and losing the point of what I am saying.  One of the hobbies I enjoyed while on Adderall, was gardening.  I want to, but I can’t even get myself to start planning.  I am behind on training at work because it requires reading boring things and I can’t stay focused on it and my fidgeting and leg shaking when I am sitting is starting do drive my husband nuts (he just gives me a gentle reminder when I start). I keep procrastinating things and end up forgetting about them, leaving me feeling like I am being inconsiderate and a failure.  I tell her all this during the less than 10 minute visit and all she does is increase the Wellbutrin from 350mg to 450mg and tell me to come back in 8 weeks.  I don’t necessarily want to go back on Adderall, and just want relief, I would be happy to try something else, or go back to the Adderall even if it was closely monitored.  And I swear if I hear one more time “go to the gym” I am going to scream.  (I do work out 3 days a week)

TL;DR
Looking for advice
I have ADHD, ended up abusing my Adderall,  been off it for a year, really feel I need to be on something for the ADHD I am miserable feeling back to my old pre Adderall failure self.  I feel like honesty has not been the best policy in my case, I am at the point that I just want to go to a new Dr. not disclose anything about my abuse and try to get back on it.  I really feel like I can’t handle stuff anymore.  I don’t want to get high, I just want to feel ‘normal’.

"Question about meds I don’t know if this is the right place to ask this question. If not, maybe someone could point me in the right direction. 

I’m 32 and have never really sought treatment for PTSD related to childhood abuse and neglect. I developed some dysfunctional coping skills along the way, but as I’ve learned in therapy (I just started) those strategies are no longer working for me. 

So my question is about whether it’s worthwhile to pursue medication. I have an intense amount of anxiety about seeing a psychiatrist. I’m worried that I won’t be taken seriously or that I won’t be able to express myself properly or that I will be seen as a hypochondria or a drug seeker. 

Right now my symptoms are pretty intense. Something will trigger a negative emotion and I will feel a sense of agitation and panic for hours or even days before the tightness in my chest loosens and I feel like I can breathe again. This will usually lead into a depressive episode.

"My brother has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. What can I do? I’m 32, my brother is 22. We have never been very close, due to our age gap and never living in the same house as my parents separated. But we have always kept in touch and seen each other when I was in town. My family is extremely dysfunctional, to add some context.

Sadly he moved in with my narcissistic alcoholic father when he was 15, and since then has been down the wrong path. The last few years he has not worked, smoked marijuana daily and hung around complete losers while my father did nothing about it. His anxiety increased, and he has distanced himself from all of our family members.

1 year ago he was admitted to hospital with delusions while he was at my mums (escaping problems with my dad I believe), and spent 6 weeks there. Diagnosed with ‘drug induced psychosis’. On discharge went back to my father’s and has been doing nothing much, apparently not taking drugs but who knows.

6 weeks ago he was readmitted and spent 3 weeks there, and was discharged again, not sure where he went. And I just heard from my mum this weekend that he was admitted a 3rd time and discharged again. Mum got a call from the hospital nurse letting her know he had been admitted but was now discharged. It was the first she had heard of it.

My brother has never taken a call from me when in hospital, and never answers his mobile when I try to contact him. He refuses to speak to mum. I don’t know what his relationship with my dad is like, they fight a lot, but I think he goes back there because it’s easy for him.


My mother is losing her mind as she can’t do anything. He won’t talk to her. She can’t get updates from my dad. The hospital doesn’t involve her constantly. She is worried about what is going to happen to him because the hospital just keeps discharging him without any housing and he goes back to dads. No idea if they have started any antipsychotics the third time - the first they didn’t, the second they started oral only, and we didn’t get any info about the third admission,

I read somewhere that most people with schizophrenia reject their families. Is this true? What can we do?

She is on no meds at all and progressively getting worse and worse with delusions of demons trying to tell her to kill people but also some angels have been helping her out.

"Advice on imitation? I was hoping to get some advice regarding my baby boy. He is 7 years old and was diagnosed with autism when he was 2. 
    For the last several months he has been randomly saying certain things in a different tone of voice. For example, if he got in trouble for something, he would say “I need to go potty.” I assumed he was just trying to escape the situation so I didn’t think anything of it. If a door was left open, he would get upset and constantly repeat “close the door, close the door.” Again, I didn’t think anything of it. 
We were at a school event and I met one of his classmates, let’s call him Matthew. Matthew was upset at the time and was saying the same things that my son has been saying. I heard Matthew but I thought it was my son because he sounded exactly the same.

Should I be worried that my boy is imitating Matthew so much? Is there anything I should be doing or saying to stop this behavior?

Dear Tom
It's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.

I wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.

Peace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.

I also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask ""how's school?"", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than ""good"" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.

So you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be ""normal"", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be ""normal"" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what ""normal"" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.

The affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.

I have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.

My anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say ""What's wrong with you?"". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.

My depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.

Since my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.

I'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.

You have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.

You used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line ""you're destroying this family"" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.

But now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said ""you're destroying the family""; what you meant was something different. ""Family"" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, ""Family"" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was ""you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear"" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.

You'd also say ""I put a roof over your head"". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. ""I did my job, so now you owe me"". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the ""family"".

You aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.

I could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The ""zig-zag"" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.

Words can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that ""my kid is dying"" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.

You might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your ""gifts"". The toys were a way of saying ""sorry I bashed your head the other day"", or maybe ""please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute"". The car was a way of saying ""please disappear"". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was ""destroying the family"" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a ""bad investment"" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple ""grudge"" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your ""gifts"".

Sometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. ""Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years"", ""nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?"", ""nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?"", ""nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?"". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in ""raising"" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and ""destroy the family"".

Another inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.

I tried to explain what it was like to be ""raised"" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.

Moving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.

I'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.

On days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.

I think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.

It's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.

This letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to ""destroy the family"".",ptsd,ptsd
"Will I seem drug seeking if I go to a doctor for ADHD? Can a regular family doctor prescribe the meds? I feel like all of the symptoms of ADHD apply to me.. I was forced to go to therapy when I was 12 and was diagnosed with severe depression but I wasn’t open with my therapist about all of my symptoms and how I was doing, because I didn’t want to be there. Therefore, I never had the chance to be diagnosed. (also antidepressants just made everything worse for me) I feel like if I had actually opened up about everything and how school was really going, I could have been diagnosed. I don’t know if that’s worth mentioning, I just feel like depression and ADHD are often intertwined. 

I graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA, but this was ONLY because I was a cheater. I cheated through everything.  I am ashamed of that, but I just could never focus on the work. I procrastinated everything up to the hour it was due, I copied others homework, found keys for tests and aced them. I’m 18 and in college now.. 4.0 GPA but that’s because I’m in online classes and I can easily find the answers to tests. 
Because of my great academic record I feel like the doctor will just dismiss my symptoms, because I know ADHD is normally associated with bad grades. I feel like he’d just be like “Well you seem to be doing fine.”

I just feel so hopeless and scared to go, and I wasn’t sure where else to post this. I’ll finally get a medicaid card in a few days and I’d really like a professional diagnosis, but i’m not sure where to go. There aren’t any psychiatrists in my area really that accept my medicaid, and the doctor that I would see has ADD under the list of things that he sees people for. Does this mean that he can diagnose and prescribe medicine? Or will that first require a diagnosis from a psychiatrist? I’ve tried to google this but I get mixed answers: some say you have to see a psychiatrist first, some say their doctor prescribed it. 
If I go, when the receptionist asks “What are you here for?” what do I say? I don’t want to seem like I’m self-diagnosing.. I’ve just researched as much as possible about ADHD and feel like I’ve identified with symptoms my whole life. 

I don’t really like the idea of being on medicine to “fix me”, it’s part of the reason I got off of antidepressants. Plus antidepressants ruined me. I gained 80 lbs over the years, they made my appetite unending and I started binge eating, my depression got worse, and I was extremely impulsive, non-empathetic, and careless. 
However, I’ve heard of ADHD medicine really improving the lives of those affected by it. I know it’s not a miracle drug, but if it can help me to function better I want to at least try getting on it. 
I’m just tired of being tired, I’m tired of being the last one to understand things, people being angry at me for how forgetful I am, not being able to focus even when I try, I’m tired of having no motivation.

Sorry for the rambling and questions, I know a lot of it was irrelevant, disorganized, and just me talking about how I feel. I just don’t have anyone to talk to about this stuff, I hope someone here can maybe understand my situation. Thanks for listening. ",adhd,adhd

"EMDR therapy for help with panic attacks? Some backstory: 

Three years ago I experienced a random panic attack while I was driving. I didn't know what it was at the time but I thought I was about to die (heart attack or suffocation)

It took me a bit to get back in the car and drive anywhere. I transferred schools and lived away for three years without a car and I didn't think anything of it anymore. Now, I am out of school and living back home and I am severely limited by where I can drive and I still don't drive in the same place anymore as where I had my first attack.

So I started seeing a CBT therapist in August and just went to see a psychiatrist last Saturday. My psychiatrist treated veterans at the VA suffering from PTSD. He asked me if I've ever had a near death experience or been through something traumatic. I told him no and that I didn't know if I could call my first panic attack a traumatic experience but it was to me and I've never felt so scared in my life. He told me that counts.

That's when I sort of reassessed what I've been dealing with. I've been sure I've had panic disorder, except I only ever get them when the variables are the same as the first time. (Me driving, hot day, etc.) I haven't ever suffered a random panic attack since then.

It's for this reason why he suggested EMDR for me. I was wondering if anyone here has had success with it and could share a little about their experience with it?",ptsd,ptsd
"How can I know if I'll be able to start drinking again after a period of abstinence? I've been abstaining from alcohol for four days now, because I've started noticing problems.
I was making excuses for my drinking, tried to hide it from friends, used it as a pastime for the evenings. I probably had around 4 pints on average each day. I definitely felt psychologically dependent on it, in the sense that I couldn't say no to a drink offered to me or if I felt like one, even if I wanted to have a drink-free day.
However, I haven't felt any physical withdrawal symptoms since I stopped, but I have lots of cravings and have to convince myself everytime not to have a drink.
My plan is to stop for a month, because I know my problems would only get worse. 
But I don't want to stop for good, I'd like to be able to drink like I did a year ago.
Is it possible, without a physical addiction, for the psychological addiction to subside after some time? Or is it already too late for that? Or will I only be able to find out by trying?

I am a sexual assault victim, when I came forward there was retaliation and stalking against another victim, he always made bail, after 2 years at the sentencing he was put on suicide watch. It has been a really intense time for me. I also believe I was assaulted as a child... I tried emdr therapy but I couldn’t do it anymore I panicked and stopped going. I finally sought help from an psych APRN. She referred me to the medical marijuana program and prescribed me klonopin originally just at night and an antidepressant. The antidepressant was horrible, I felt like I was in a bubble and even more sad. Like this really sad film over my life. She decided that my anxiety is too high and that I should try the klonopin during the day to in the am to see if that helps. So I’m doing am and pm, the goal is to just do medical marijuana and be on no meds. I’m just terrified I’m getting sucked into something that’s hard to get off of.

"A little encouragement... So, as I've mentioned several previous times, I was raised by a Cluster-B (Narc-heaviest) and an Antisocial Personality disordered step-monster.

My disorder completely destroyed my life, eventually, taking away the only entities on earth that mattered to me at the time, and I'd had them full-time for 7 years after their mom abandon them.

im currently sixteen and i work in an acting summer day camp and recently there was a seven year old enrolled that is high functioning on the spectrum (no clear diagnosis, and im not gonna diagnose him myself) . his mom brought a book (fantastic beasts and where to find them) and a beanbag for him if he gets overstimulated and needs a safe place to go to.

&amp;#x200B;

it's the second day and while he is slightly disruptive, he's a real sweetheart and obviously has no ill intention. my older brother (18 now) has high functioning aspergers. because i have prior experience because of my brother, and im the most patient with the 7 y.o. out of the camp counselors (they tend to get frustrated with him because he speaks out and isn't good with social cues, and he's also really touchy, which i don't mind but others do) i've kind of been put on the job of looking over him and making sure he feels okay and is following directions well. today, he must've been overstimulated, because when we asked them to line up for a game, he ended up putting one of the girls in a choke hold (not anything damaging, just shocked her more than anything) and then also put his hands around a boys throat (one of his friends that he's known for a while) and the boy started coughing, but seemed fine after like, thirty seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

he didn't seem openly upset or angry before or when he was doing it, and he seemed like he was just messing around and didn't realize he was hurting them. i took him to his beanbag and lectured him for a bit about how he can't hurt the other kids, but he seemed like he didn't really understand. so then read his book to him (he can't read yet) until he was ready to go back and finish camp. we obviously told his mom what happened and she said he hasn't done that in a long time.

are there some signs i can catch before he possibly does this again, so i can stop it before it happens? what are some ways i can discipline him, or making him realize what he's done is wrong without overstepping my boundaries because i'm not his parent?

"Dating someone with PTSD Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this was the right place to ask, but I've started a romantic relationship with someone who has PTSD from combat situations. 

He struggles a lot with it, and some days are much worse than others for him. He withdraws and does not want to talk about anything, responding with short snippets. He pushes me away, believing he is a burden and will only drag me down. He sometimes asks loaded questions that indicate this. He has a self-sacrifice mentality for sure. He finds it very hard to trust me, which is okay. I do my best not to push him to talk about things he doesn't want to. He won't help me help him. We talk about how we can better communicate and figure these things out, but I'm not a mind reader. When he withdraws, I don't know how to approach him. 

He's extremely alert all of the time, jumping at slight sounds and disturbances. I remind him it's okay every time he apologizes for this. His nightmares will wake me up sometimes, and I try not to make him feel guilty and be supportive. 

I just don't know what behavior is a result of PTSD and what is his personality. He's a great person, and I don't want to give up just because of this. I understand that it's something no amount of love and care can just fix, and telling him to get over it isn't helpful either. It seems to me that there's a lot of guilt he carries, and it's hard to see that I can't convince him he's worth helping and fixing.

"My roommate had a suicidal outburst last night Hi everybody, I'm not sure if this belongs here but I figure there's no shame in trying. My roommate is a 29 year-old statistician pursuing a PhD in our town's university. He's always been a withdrawn introverted personality. Over the last few months, I had noticed he'd been building a bar in our food pantry containing concerning amounts of hard liquor. 

Last night was the first night I saw him sloshed. He revealed to me that he's had previous problems with alcoholism and that past roommates had to intervene when he was considered a threat to himself. He revealed he'd gone to AA meetings in the past, not recently, and that he had been going to therapy. This was all new to me.

He gave me indications that he might try to harm himself. I honestly don't think he was serious, but I'm not sure. He seemed to be crying for help to see who would respond. I listened to him, did my best to calm him down and cooked him some ramen. I tried to get him to talk about some of trips and projects he had planned that are coming up to get him on back on positive ground. I told him that he can always talk to me and that he doesn't have to go through this alone. He also mentioned that he had set up a Monday meeting to see his therapist and that his boss at work had reached out to offer her support.  

My roommate seems quite troubled. I met his mom earlier this year and she seemed like a shell of a person. He only refers to his dad in past-tense. I'm not sure if his dad is still living, which really concerns me. He seems really insecure about who he is and has displayed needy and clingy tendencies towards other people he goes to school with.

"I Interviewed at an ABA Facility  

This after-school organization for autistic kids had a kiosk at a career fair I attended a couple weeks ago, so I walked over, handed them a resume, and stuck around for a bit to specifically discuss my misgivings about ABA (and about the whole principle of delineating autism in terms of ‘functionality’). I think, at least at the time, my concerns were well met— the woman at the booth obviously worked with advocacy/outreach as opposed to on-the-ground clinical cases, so she shared some of my skepticism about behavioral therapy, although she felt the merits of the organization outweighed the potential for individual abuse. Her manner (paradoxically, her ambivalence about ABA) set me at ease, so I told her she could add my resume to the applicant pool for 'therapy assistants' at their behavioral clinics.  

So, I got the go-ahead for an interview at a facility which happened to be on the third floor of a bank. As I arrived, there was this reception area next to a hallway opening into seven or eight retrofitted classrooms, each of which was supposed to correspond to a different ‘aptitude level.’ One of the managers found me just sitting across from the front desk and invited me to ‘shadow’ some of the classroom activities while I waited for my interview- initially she led me to what I think was one of the lower-aptitude rooms, where there were just, like, three or four kids sitting unresponsively at separate tables, while counselors hovered around to maintain calm. There were homework-adjacent math handouts and that sort of thing littered around, but no one seemed to be paying much attention to them. Also, all the buzzy flourescent office lights were switched on- I asked one of the counselors how the kids felt about the harsh lighting and she sort of stared for a moment and said it hadn’t occurred to her to wonder.

Eventually the same manager came back for me and led me into one of the ‘higher aptitude’ classrooms, which was mostly full of teenagers, with a desktop computer pushed up against one corner and some maps on the wall.  It was actually kind of difficult to distinguish the employees from the inmates until somebody ‘misbehaved’ and they had to spring into action. They were all supposed to be doing multiplication tables. One of the counselors actually drew me aside and started blithely explaining how some of these teenagers are chronic masturbators, so they need to be supervised on trips to the bathroom. Rather than launching into a metaphysical discussion about the consequences of pathologizing masturbation, I was led at this moment out of the second classroom and into the manager’s office for my interview. She asked what interested me about the job and right away I brought up the fact that I’m autistic- I didn’t really examine my own motives at the time, but now I wonder whether there wasn’t part of me that wanted to impress her with my relative normalcy. In fact, that’s definitely what I was doing. Just for a moment, my subliminal strategy for getting the job was presenting myself as a model autist (who had presumably benefitted from some form of behavioral conditioning), in contrast to the dysfunctional subjects of her program.  

The guilt didn’t really set in until a couple hours after I walked out of the interview- I’m ashamed to say that initially I was just elated not to have made any major social blunders. And then I forced myself to keep thinking about how the counselors didn’t really pay attention to the kids they were supposed to be counseling unless the kids were fidgeting or shouting, which was the ‘misbehavior’ they were supposed to discourage; how they trapped these children who already have difficulty communicating in a harsh and repressive sensory environment without making any attempt to understand how this might impede their functionality; and how they pathologize the sexual habits of 16-year olds to an extent which would be outrageous were it not for the fact that those 16-year-olds happen to be autistic. I talked it over with some friends and it hit me that I obviously can’t accept this job if it’s offered to me, and as it is I took my morbid curiosity way too far. Part of me is still kind of grateful to have had an inside look at the whole process. Simultaneously, I understand that what I was flirting with was the possibility of grossly economizing my privilege as a ‘passable’ autistic person and I’m still guilty about how comfortably that role fit me.",autism,autism

"New Triggers Causing Another Side Of Me Hi,

I am new to reddit and stumbled across a post that I found helpful about living with ptsd in a relationship. I was in a previous relationship where I was verbally and physically abused. We were together for far too long. I finally grew the courage to escape. I changed my job, address, phone and cut off any friends that my ex and I had in common. I needed a fresh start.

I took some time to heal my heart and soul. I eventually found a very understanding, caring and loving man that accepted me, even with my broken wings (what I call my major relationship baggage). We have been together now for 4 years. We have been doing well with our normal relationship bumps, even with my constant panic attacks/ anxiety/ bad days.

But we are planning a major move and found out I have some triggers that I didn't know existed. Moving is so stressful, especially cross country. We have had 2 bad arguments which lead to him saying certain words that my ex would say when we used to fight. My current boyfriend is so good to me and not remotely abusive (mentally or physically) but when he unknowingly said the words that my ex would say to me I have found myself being taken over. I feel like I am back in a fight with my ex. I have shoved my current boyfriend and slapped my boyfriend yesterday.

I am so incredibly ashamed! He reacted by leaving our apartment each time to get space. I literally ran him away. He would never hurt me and I know he is not my ex. I can't believe that I ever laid my hands on him. There is no excuse for it. I don't know how to explain this to myself let alone him. I am a peaceful person that avoids confrontation at all costs.

Has this happened to anybody else and can anybody please give me advice on how to deal with these new triggers?! I love my boyfriend so much and don't want to run him away!",ptsd,ptsd

"For the most part, I hate movies; is this the norm? 50-something guy. I've never been formally diagnosed as ADD, but I am. Prescribed meds by my g.p.

As a kid and teen I liked television well enough and watched plenty. This was before the days of computers, though! I can remember subscribing to TV Guide and finding the 5 Star classic movies being shown during the week and trying to watch them. This was the era when you might only get one chance a year.

But for most of my adult life I haven't much enjoyed movies. This has been a bane for wife, who constantly wants to go to a movie house or watch a movie at home. I do like an occasional movie, which I'll get to later.

Here are some of my problems with movies. First, I'm slightly hard of hearing, and my wife refuses to use the close captioning. I can understand most of what's said, but I have to work at it. But the second thing is that the people who make movies have gotten better at their craft. One of the goals of movie makers is to create comedic, dramatic, or suspenseful tension. The tension is just overpowering. Even the comedic tension puts me on edge because of the extreme awkwardness. And, of course, I don't like sitting still, but at home I can solve this by just standing up.

I should note that not all movies or TV shows affect me this way, but my wife seems to gravitate towards those that do. I liked a movie called Cider House Rules that my wife has steadfastly refused to watch when we've been on vacation with the kids. I liked the Sixth Sense, the Harry Potter movies, Ordinary People, and some other stuff. I realize some of these are old. I don't watch many movies.

Anyway, just curious if many people find movies almost painful to watch.",adhd,adhd
"Silly question. My first psychiatrist I saw determined I had a “prodrome” phase of I guess schizophrenia, he didn’t specify he just said “you have a prodrome”, this was after a couple appointments. I knew something was up but I didn’t expect a diagnosis of psychosis. 

Anyways the very FIRST day I saw him (this was about 3 years ago) he gave me an anti psychotic, risperidone. I’m on a pretty high dose of amisulpride now. I should also mention I randomly have positive symptoms pop up, and I forget that most of them happened, so I don’t know how he got the idea to give me meds. 

The second time I went to hospital I asked (none of my admissions were from positive psychotic symptoms), “why did you give me an anti psychotic the very first day I saw you?” And he replied “because you weren’t communicating well” he said I seem to be doing a lot better now (I haven’t seen this psychiatrist in 2 years.)

"Helping a friend Hi all so I am helping a friend that has autism and other issues including depression. He is an Adult capable of making his own decisions.

 I have noticed a pattern of behavior that is trauma based due to his dysfunctional family. He is an adult but at the core I see his behavior as attention seeking. 

How without being insensitive tell him what his family is to afraid to tell him? This being

That he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his actions and stop wallowing  in self pity. That yes his trauma is valid but he needs to move past this to heal

 He has a trauma centered identy,that is not healthy for him. It triggers the depression when the focus is off him and he gets jealous of other family members when they receive positive attention. 

He has always attracted negative behavior due to Alcoholism in the family home. He was the "" Good Child"" but is suffering from the abuse from  Alcohol in the house.

The are afraid to tell him in to grow up because the mother in the situation will have know one to rerescue she would have to face her own issues.
Yet the only way he can heal is hearing someone to tell him to grow up and get help. 

In my location their is a scheme called the Ndis (national disability insurance scheme )
He is able to make simple phone calls but percives he isn't disabled enough to deserve help or puts it into a to hard basket. 

So he needs to access the help but sometimes I get frustrated because he won't ask for help until it is to late.  The core of getting him to grow up is to get him access to the help he needs to stop the family over care.",autism,autism

"Mental and physical hunger, fullness and appetite in Anorexia Recovery? \*Just a little warning of numbers and possible triggering info\*

Hey,

I've got a couple concerns and questions about appetite and hunger in anorexia recovery and would really appreciate any advice.

Just some context: I'm a guy in my late teens currently recovering from anorexia - started just over 3 weeks ago. Right now, I'm on the taller bit of 5'10 (nearly 5'11), I'm a guy in my late teens, and a few days before deciding to recover, I was about 47kg. So yeah... that's a preeeetty low BMI. Since being in recovery, I've gone a tad bit crazy on the eating side of things and eaten a lot of food - and I mean A LOT. I was terrified of being admitted to a hospital and agreed to being treated by my family. So back in late 2017, I was quite chubby + overweight. I was around 75kg-ish (didn't really pay attention to weight but recall once being weighed a little while before deciding to lose weight) and quite a bit shorter than I am now. Anyway, at the beginning of 2018, I decided I wanted to lose weight was still eating pretty normally, maybe just a little less and being mindful to not snack on a whole family size bag of crisps on the way home from school, etc. as well as going to the school's gym every now and then but not really enjoying it. I really just wanted to be lean and muscly. Nearly a year ago exactly, I kinda started restricting my food intake quite a bit more than usual - eating a tiny breakfast and having some tiny snacks throughout the day, then eating dinner with my family. At that point, I didn't really think anything was wrong. I got to a lower weight that I was happy with but was terrified of gaining weight again, so further kept restricting. It got progressively worse and worse and by the beginning of October I was at 52kg. My parents intervened at that point and I agreed to eat more, but was terrified of the sharp weight gain and went back to restricting (my parents still under the impression I was eating lots). To cut a long story short, since then my restricting, walking quite a bit and doing body-weight exercises in my room to try look toned, and calorie counting (plus some binge-restrict cycles) got to a terrible point and I had all the telltale signs of anorexia (bad hair, skin, bony as hell, constantly cold, irritable, anxiety around food, etc. etc.) and was at 47kg at 5'10-ish. I knew I couldn't really go on like this.

Like I said, since starting recovery just over 3 weeks ago, I started eating a bunch. In hindsight, it was SUPER dangerous to instantly hit my system with that much food and I probably could've died from refeeding syndrome, but I'm here now I guess. I was just so desperate to eat and although I was aware of refeeding syndrome, didn't think it really applied to me and didn't care at that point (pretty stupid and very dangerous, I know), though my parents were worried sick for the first couple of days. Since then I ate all the meals my family made me, plus quite a bit after. My eating is now a more structured and don't eat AS much outside of meals as I initially did - trying just eating what I'm given right now.

Anyway, I was a little bit scared of my desire to just continue eating, despite often physical fullness. I've tried now only sticking to what I'm given on my plate and no more. I sometimes find it hard to understand my fullness and often I will be physically full but not satisfied and want to keep eating until I'm really uncomfortably full - but I don't want to feel so bloated and uncomfortable after.  I also don't want to keep gaining weight this fast. I don't know how much I weigh right now but I have 100% gained a bunch and can see my face is puffier, my belly has a bunch of fat, etc. etc.  About 2 weeks after starting recovery I was around 55kg when I saw the doctor. That of course is pretty distressing but I guess it may be water weight...? Anyway, I may really have gotten to 55 or even more after just over 3 weeks of gluttony, but I can't do anything about that now. I'm terrified of the lack of definition on my body but trying quite hard working on the whole body image and self acceptance thing, trying to stop looking at myself and comparing myself to others.

I'm not sure if the ""extreme hunger"" is over and I'm simply emotionally eating, or not. I'm not sure if eating has turned into my new coping mechanism as I'm still a bit depressed and am struggling with the things that come with recovery and don't have much else to do. I feel as though I have the ability to just keep eating to infinity a lot of the time, and it's not always physical hunger. Sometimes it is, sometimes it's more mental or just a desire. I really don't want to get into any overeating habits or anything... I'm pretty worried and don't know what to do. There's no going back to restriction but should I just stick to the meal I'm given (no seconds, etc) and my appetite will normalise, or keep eating despite often feeling a little physically not great? I honestly can't recall how I felt after eating pre-ED. I don't know how a normal person feels while eating or about their appetite or fullness/satisfaction and if they even feel like eating more.

Any experience or knowledge and advice would be super appreciated! Thanks!",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

"Should I go see the doctor? Ever since I was 8 I believe I've had schizophrenia, at my old house (8-9 years old) I once saw a confederate soldier staring at me upstairs so I had my brothers cousin bring a rifle upstairs because he thought there was an intruder and demons moving around my room talking to me. Once at my mothers I had a few fleas on my leg and I started having a psychotic break and was saying that the demons from a few years back sent these bugs to kill me, this was four years ago.

"I just started learning about my ADHD at the age of 18 and I’m struggling with life Heyo, I’m an 18 year old who was diagnosed with ADHD ever since I was a young boy. My mom was an occupational therapist and got me checked out and prescribed to a medicine. I’ve been taking Concerta since elementary school. 
I didn’t understand ADHD completely. I’ve always known the basics of ADHD. My brain is different and I can’t focus and I do things without question. I thought that was all of it. 
Now, after getting into a serious relationship with a girl that I really love. I started noticing things. My head would go crazy everyday. I felt like I had so many problems and I couldn’t find an explanation or a solution. I thought that I was insecure, low self esteem, over thinking, anxiety, and many more. I couldn’t pin point it and then I remember that I have this thing called ADHD. I started to research it more and more. I found out that the blame I would put on myself countlessly over the years had a reason to it. I felt a huge relief for about a week. I felt so much joy realizing that It’s okay that I’m different. It’s apart of my life. I still have a lot to learn and it’s fun finding out reasons for things I’ve done in the past. ( Like why I was the biggest trouble maker in our whole school because all I did was impulsively wrestle with my friends and I would hurt them and get punished. I am a pretty big guy and always have been. I’m 6’ 3” and 280 pounds and a Division 1 Offensive Lineman. Sorry I had to brag). 

But after awhile I hit a bump. I felt like complete crap over the things I do. Like every mistake I make. I feel terrible for my girlfriend to have to deal with me and my ADHD and the problems it will come with. I learned about emotional dysfunction and more. I learned about all this worrying that goes into my head. All the negative thoughts I have to deal with And when those negative thoughts come into my mind. I act different and I feel like I put it on my girlfriend and then that just leads to guilt. I feel like every thing I’m doing can lead to more and more problems. I feel like I don’t have a control over my thoughts. I feel discouraged when I read about all these problems that come with ADHD and how hard it is. 

And the point of making this post, ( My first post so sorry if I didn’t do something correct lol ), I feel like I need to talk to some of you. Hear what you guys have to say. I don’t have any friends who have ADHD. The only person i feel like I connect with is the girl on YouTube called How to ADHD. I’m looking for a therapist right now and my parents are helping. I just need someone to talk to and give me something reliable. I read too much on the internet and I haven’t had an actual real conversation with anyone. I’ve talked to my girlfriend but I feel like telling her every bad thought in my head is something she doesn’t deserve to hear. And she can only do so much. She can put my worries to rest but new ones come up. I don’t want to have to rely on her. I want to better myself. I want to be happy and content.

"What's it like being on the ""High-Functioning"" end of the spectrum? (I'm looking to simply understand how you perceive the word. How you found out you were high-functioning and how life was before knowing, if you were diagnosed later in life.)

Some things I'd like to know, but not limited to:

* Do you lead a normal/typical life? 
* Do you stand out? 
* Did finding out you had ASD help you cope with your differences?
* Did the diagnosis come as a surprise? (For those diagnosed later in life.)
* Do people treat you any differently?

I'm completely ignorant to the autism disorder as I've never actually met anyone (that I know of) that has had the disorder. I've only seen it on TV, but TV shows usually only depict genius savants or kids with extremely uncontrolled autism, as it aids to the drama of the series. But I know it's not always like that, likely not even the majority of the time.

Why I'm curious? I've always been curious about this ever since I was told by my psychology teacher that I showed a lot of signs of ASD. This wasn't a diagnosis nor a professional opinion, but simply the observation of someone who knew a thing or two. I never thought it was possible though, as everything I'd ever seen pertaining to the disorder was on TV where they amplified the symptoms for the sake of drama and I clearly didn't act like any of those people.

"Anxious/Scared I'm in prodromal phase of schizophrenia? Hello r/schizophrenia, I hope you're all doing well and that the subject matter of my post is not alarming.

I have come to the subreddit to explain how I'm feeling, and how worried I am. I basically think I'm entering the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, and I'm extremely scared.

I've not heard voices, I've not hallucinated, and I'm not deluded - I don't think the government's out to get me or that people can read my thoughts, but I'm scared that other parts of me are becoming affected. I've become really tired and lethargic in recent weeks, I'm not eating much, I've noticed that while I'm still laughing, I'm nowhere near as happy with doing things as I was before. 

The two concerning symptoms I have is my memory and a general brain fog. I used to have an amazing memory - I could remember stuff out of the blue and would hardly ever forget ANYTHING, much less simple stuff like I am now. I'm not forgetting to grab things when I need them, like if I'm going out, and I'm not forgetting things like my birthday or other important dates. I'm just feeling generally forgetful. In addition, I am also having problems with speaking coherently - I'm not jumbling them up word salad style or going off on freaky, unrelated tangents, but I'm often having trouble keeping track of what I'm saying - I'm losing focus when speaking, if you will, which I can recognise and correct. 

I am not having focus issues when reading, I am not being clumsy, I am not suspicious or paranoid of other people, I'm not neglecting friends, family, my hygiene or responsibilities, but I feel like I'm constantly on the lookout for any potential symptom of schizophrenia that I can find. And I want to know why I am constantly doing this.

If this information helps, I am 19 years old, Male, diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome but no other mental health condition, I have a distant relative (great aunt's son) who is a diagnosed schizophrenic, and I have recently quit a 15 month cannabis habit (not daily but some periods of daily use followed by 1-3 day breaks in between. This 15 months began October 2017, shortly after I turned 18 and finished on the 7th January. I never used more than around a gram to two grams a day during this habit, and occasionally I used less than a gram. I have quit for 12 days as of this post.). None of these symptoms were present before I smoked, or during, only after. I think these symptoms are to do with weed withdrawals sending my anxiety into a tailspin, but I'm honestly not so sure at this point.

Is anyone able to provide me with any reassurance that I am not going, or even possibly going, schizophrenic? I am seriously worried about developing it and the consequences of it as such, so any advice is widely welcomed. Thank you so much for reading and understanding :) ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"Yesterday I managed to humiliate myself, lose the respect of my mentors, and jeopardize my job and education. I'm freaking out   

Hi. I also posted this on r/stopdrinking for more support. I’m sorry if this is long or irrelevant, but I have been having a panic attack over this for the last 8 hours and I Really need to hear/talk to people who have also been close to destroying their lives with stupid alcohol. 

For background, I am a graduate teaching assistant for the summer and also work in a research lab. 

Unfortunately, one thing that is really freaking me out is that this is my second strike. My boss for my lab pulled me aside about 4 months ago to comment that he feels alcohol has been heavily affecting my productivity and that he can smell it on me sometimes (note that he is a very strict man who is also a Mormon. I’m kind of afraid of him). He told me that I needed to see the school substance abuse counselor. I complied, and the councilor recommended me for intensive outpatient therapy and gave me a number. Honestly, I completely blew it off. I didn’t understand how my health insurance worked and didn’t feel like figuring it out. However, the topic never came up again, and I ceased having a morning beer before I went in. 

Currently I am TAing a late morning lab. Tuesday night I had WAY WAY too much to drink (first time I’ve vomited from alcohol in almost a decade). I woke up in time for my class (Definitely still probably kind of drunk), and went in. I was admittedly pretty useless as again, really hungover and probably still kind of drunk, but I thought I made it through pretty okay.  

Today, the chair of my department pulled me aside and asked to speak with me after my lab. When I did, she mentioned that she had concerns- someone (no idea who) had raised concerns that I might have a neurological issue because I was stumbling. She then told me that she had called my lab boss to express concern, and he told her about our previously conversation. She expressed to me that she is concerned about me, and that I need to be more responsible and to please just call in next time. 

Needless to say I was pretty frazzled by all of this, which is where I maybe fucked up and could have saved things? The thing is, I did/do have a neurological disease. In my early 20s I went about a year where I couldn’t walk without heavy assistance, and then spent the next several years with a pretty severe limp. I’m basically recovered, but I never regained all of my balance. Stone cold sober and not tired it isn’t a huge deal and isn’t really noticeable- I kind of sway a bit, I definitely trip, crash into things more than normal people, and don’t always walk in a straight line (I was in addiction treatment for a DUI right around the time that I was diagnosed with this disease, and it took a crazy amount of convincing, including being breathalyzed and drug tested, to convince the councilors I wasn’t inebriated). I also lean on things and stand in a certain way to minimize falling over.  When I’m drunk, hungover, sick, whatever it gets way way worse. I thought I was doing pretty okay yesterday, but I Wasn’t concentrating on it nearly as much as I would, so I was stumbling more. I SHOULD have disclosed this to the chair. I really should have, but a mixture of me hating talking about it (I was told I would never walk again) and being totally blindsided, it didn’t really cross my mind. 

Anyway, I apologized profusely for my unprofessionalism and assured her it wouldn’t happen again. Within two hours of our meeting I had figured out my healthcare insurance and had an appointment with a therapist for their earliest possible appointment. I then emailed the chair to apologize again and let her know that I was taking appropriate action to remedy the situation. 

I’m kind of considering telling her about my disease tomorrow, but at this point I worry it may look like I’m making excuses, PLUS I want to talk about this as little as possible. 

What I’m now super concerned about is my boss. Again, this is my second strike with him and he is also very image conscious (he likes that his is the most prestigious lab). He is on vacation until next week, so I have like a week to stew over this. I don’t THINK he will fire me, but I have definitely lost a lot of his trust so that doesn’t bode well. Either way it is going to be a very uncomfortable and painful talk as he really is the ‘lecturing’ type. 

So, there you go. I’m freaking out. In 1 hour I managed to apparently humiliate myself, lose the respect of three of my mentors, and put my job and education at risk. 

This is all still very fresh, but I don’t know what else I can do.

"I believe my SO has schizoaffective disorder and I’m not sure what to say or do My husband (23M) has told me that he has hallucinations (voices, seeing black shadows of people that aren’t there) and since I have known him he has exhibited childlike behavior (claims it’s just his “personality”) but can act normal 50% of the time. I didn’t think much of it at first, but I’ve realized these are symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. I’m not sure how to nicely ask him to get help or ask him if he agrees that he shares a lot of the symptoms associated with the disorder. I truly want to help him, and his childish behavior is starting to affect our marriage as I feel like I married a 12 year old boy. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

"Question about weird feeling when not taking Vyvanse or Adderall for a day or two.

"I am in serious danger of failing all of my classes. Hi. I'm in 11th grade, and I'm worried I'm about to fail all (4/4) of my classes.

Last year, I failed half (4/8) classes and the year before that I failed 2/8. I have theories on why I'm getting progressively worse at school but it is not the topic of this post.

I have at *least* twenty overdue assignments. I could get about ten of them done overnight if I had the attention span, but I don't. I am willing to stay up all night to finish my assignments, though I have a sports competition I can't skip tomorrow.

I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. The assignments NEED to be submitted by Monday or I WILL fail all of my classes. I have a five hour long sports competition on Saturday evening that I can and will not miss (even for school). 

On top of this, because I go to a semestered school, I have finals all next week. I am not ready for any of them except for one. 

I have to do this alone. My mother (who is a therapist) doesn't think I even have ADHD. My father gets frustrated with me very easily. I can't do work with either of them because it always results in me throwing a stupid tantrum, them getting very angry with me, and me being tired, frustrated and embarrassed from my behavior. They don't even know I have overdue work.

So with that, I really am here asking for help. I need some way to study and I know a lot of you have study tactics that help you. I've tried almost everything I've seen here, and my therapist has even suggested stuff, but nothing has worked so far. This is my only way of asking for help. I know at this point I should just accept failure and I know I'm being ridiculous, but that really isn't helpful advice.

"Evaluation confusion First time poster, been a lurker for a while. I'm in the midst of my diagnosis right now. My therapist and I believe it's schizoaffective depression type plus some issues from suffering horrible trauma. I have frequent hallucinations, especially during stressful times. I suffer from horrible paranoia and delusions, especially of reality not ""real"" and my husband or other people close to are just copies of the true people and they are out to get me. 
I had a breakdown over weekend and talked to my therapist today to get some medication. I brought it up with my psychiatrist who is doing my evaluation and he said no, hold off right now because he instead thinks I have frontal lobe damage and wants me to see a neurologist first?? 

I dont think I can make it another six months without antipsychotics. I seriously listened to my radiators screaming to set them free and to kill my husband all sunday night and I had work the next morning. I cant take the fear of ""dont go out there or it will get you"" every single day. Or freaking out about if everything is real or not, questioning myself. 

I read my eval results today and my schizotypical was high, along with paranoia and depression. Schizophrenia itself wasnt. Also apparently one of my results were extremely high and atypical but was common with people with diagnosed psycopathology??  So I dont know what that means. I'm really confused right now because I've never had anyone mention anything about brain damage in all my years? Is it not schizophrenia? Do I have to suffer without meds even longer now?

"Appointment with Psychiatrist for possible ADHD diagnosis tomorrow after waiting a year. I'm nervous. We've thought that I have ADHD since I was 6 but never checked up on it. When I was 18 I went to a psychiatrist about it (after my psychology teacher made me an appointment for it) and he was sceptical the moment I walked in after looking through my NHS records and seeing that I'd had councillors for various never diagnosed mental problems in the past. After about 10 minutes he told me that I couldn't have ADHD because I ""did well in school"" (I didn't).

So went to university years later. Age 22ish had some really weird exam results so went for exam feedback, the lecturer asked me if I had learning disabilities, I said idk, he told me to go to the learning disabilities people at uni, I said ok, I didn't go. A year later same thing happens again. 3 months later I go to the university disabilities people. They invite me for a test and whatever.

At this point I should point out that my university is a world top 1% university that specialises in medical, psychology and pharmacy, they still make a lot of breakthroughs and stuff in the modern day. The people that worked in the learning disabilities bit were highly qualified dudes but since they weren't doctors they couldnt officially diagnose me with anything.

So I go for my tests. He asks loads of questions, I do about 6 or 7 different tests. I'm in there for 3 hours. He eventually tells me that he ""has enough evidence to diagnose for ADHD and dyslexia"", gives me a letter to give to my doctor and gives me advise and stuff. He said at one point that it was so severe he was surprised I haven't already been kicked out of uni haha.

So 3 months later I go to the doctor, she takes me seriously because of the fancy letter from the medical university and gets me an appointment with psychiatrist. Cancelled. Rescheduled somewhere else. Cancelled. Rescheduled somewhere else. Cancelled. Rescheduled at an autism centre?? Fast forward 9 months and my appointment is tomorrow.

"Has anyone's appetite actually increased after PTSD? TW: ED I had an eating disorder as a teenager that ran until I was around 21. It went from restricting myself at 14 to only eating \~1000 calories a day to binging and purging weekly for the next 8 years. 6 months before my trauma, I decided to end it. I started eating more and healthier and lifting weights instead of the \~80 minutes of cardio a day I was doing. I felt amazing.

Then the trauma happened, and fitness was one of the interests I lost when the depression and PTSD hit. I couldn't sleep and had a very busy schedule, so I relied on (mainly junk) food to get me through all-nighters and long shifts. This turned to a comfort thing where I would down Ben and Jerry's and blame my depression. I couldn't even go back to doing cardio because an elevated heart-rate felt like a panic attack. Unsurprisingly, I gained 15 pounds, which is a lot on my 5'1 body.

It's been a year and some months, and I'm safe again. I have my degree, a job, my own apartment, and stability. Yet all I want to do is lose this weight I gained. I associate it with the worst year of my life and everything in me wants to just go back to the ""old me"" before the trauma and, in hand, the weight gain. Yet I'm so scared this restriction is going to lead to my eating becoming disordered again.

I have tried dieting, but I can't get myself to use calorie tracking apps and when I get too hungry I just...eat. I don't think about my allotted macros for the day or if I'm above or below my protein goal or if the food I'm eating ""fits in my macros"" anymore. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating with no restrictions and I still have my daily fruits and veggies. I'm also still very into weight-lifting and go to the gym 6 days a week still. I guess I just don't have the passion to diet and exercise like I used to for weight loss, though.

I hear all the time about people with PTSD not eating and withering away because of the traumatic event they had to endure. Has anybody else experienced the opposite, though- relying on food to cope? It's hard for me to relate to most stories about PTSD because so many talk about experiencing nausea and an inability to eat - but the only thing I cared about after my trauma was eating. Maybe my history of heavy restriction caused my appetite increase after the trauma as a way of preventing myself from going down that path again. I don't know.",ptsd,ptsd

"PTSD and the Police My parents are Mexican but moved to the US in the 80s. We used to take trips to Tijuana regularly because it was about 4 hrs away from our home. My first negative experience with figures of authority involved border agents sending us to secondary revision because my father didn't understand English very well and responded incorrectly to one of the questions. They asked if we brought anything from Mexico and he said no but because we had grocery bags in the back that was enough to cause suspicion. We were let go eventually but I still remember the dread of the event. Recently, I've had to deal with police officers coming to my residence looking for someone claiming to have an arrest warrant. The three times they were here I felt insulted, violated, subhuman. The police have insulted my disability. They've forced their way into my home while claiming to be willing to talk outside. They've threatened to break down doors. I've reached out to friends in activist circles and they've helped me deal with some of the trauma and given me information about organizations to reach out to.

I've been with my partner for 8.5 years and I just realised today, connecting all the dots, that he might very well be on the spectrum. This would explain a lot about his behaviour and our most serious arguments to date.

I'm not sure whether it's worth possibly insulting him by asking him to get tested. Did you all find it beneficial to finally get a diagnosis?

7 years ago, when I was in elementary school, my friend's mother, who suffered from paranoia and schizophrenia, had a bad episode and killed my friend and his sister, due to the belief the sister was raped, feeling it necessary to protect them. The day he was killed I was going to call. Try to hang out, try to reconcile. I pushed him away, I abandoned him, and I hurt him. But I didn't, still holding onto the idea that I was too cool to be his friend, even though he was there for me when I needed. I even noticed something was wrong. His mother was acting even more off than usual, more paranoid. And he had stopped smiling, the boy who always smiled, wouldn't. That day him and his sister missed school, they weren't sick at all the day before. I knew something was off. But I didn't care. And the next day, it was too late. He was gone. And I wasn't there. It was only a street from my house.
I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD but suffer from major survivor's guilt, especially in my choice not to reconcile, and for ignoring that something was wrong. How do I deal with this. Also, is PTSD a possibility? I was 10 at the time.

"I look 'sick' and it's annoying (rant) tw lots of mental health talk

I'm a fairly private person when it comes to my health. I've always struggled with anxiety and was diagnosed with depression when I was still in middle school. I've mostly been making things worse but over the last few years it's manifested this ED and really dramatic manic→depressed→manic cycle of episodes. 

I don't sleep, I don't eat, and school and work and having no money is kicking my ass.

So yeah my eyes are bloodshot all the time and my skin looks like hell and I'm visibly exhausted. *However* I still keep my business to my self. So you can imagine my frustration when now I've got one of my instructors emailing me and trying to corner me in the hallways to ""talk"" and other students fucking texting and snapchatting me to ""check in"" and it's like, I appreciate the concern but bitch I've been doing this for years without you, mind your damn business. 

Anyways, I've just been agitated about this all, I know it's out of kindness and care but I really don't feel like being backed into a corner and made to explain my health because suddenly you noticed I don't always look so good.

Not to mention I cry when confronted about myself lmao.

"S**ual repulsion, but also sometimes not? TW TW

       I've gone through kinda intense sexual trauma, and never ended up metabolising it because I've always refused to talk about it, which I guess is a me problem. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar to the following.
       When I'm around people, it doesn't matter where or how many people, I am completely sex and touch repulsed. I hate thinking about it, if anyone touches me without asking I flip my shit, and I don't even let my family touch me. When I get intrusive thoughts about sex I have to leave the room some times. 
        However there are certain times, only when I am completely alone, where completely shift from that and resort to touching myself, fantasising etc. After I'm done with those episodes, I feel super gross and awful about myself. I have to curl up and try not to think about it, and when it comes up in my head later, I cringe even worse than I normally do.
        I just don't understand, Its like I will become two completely different people and it really gets to me a lot obviously.

"Was prescribed Desoxyn(methamphetamine) a few days ago, here is what I think so far. Ive been prescrivbed focalin, ritilan, adderall, vyvanse, and dexidrine. Dexidrine was the best so far, but it still came with quite a bit of anxiety. Desoxyn releases serotonin as well as dopamine, which makes it work quite well as an anti anxiety medication. 

So far, desoxyn has almost none of the negative side effects of the other medicines. I can easily get to sleep whenever I want(even when its peaking), It doesn't suppress my appetite at all. I still socialize just as if I was off of the medicine, and I have no problems with hyperfocus. I also noticed that I am perfecty fine with doing nothing while on the medicine, but have no problems focusing on a task if I realize that it needs to get done. Its not like other amphetamines where you feel the need to be doing something while the medicine is working. It just helps you focus on the task at hand. 

The only downside Ive seen so far is that it makes my pupils pretty damn big, and that's due to the serotonin release. Other than that, it seems to be a great medicine for those who get anxiety and over stimulation on other medicines. 

Desoxyn is not neurotoxic at FDA approved therapeutic doses(15 mg a day iirc), and you wont end up like the ""faces of meth"" people unless you abuse the drug and use it to stay up for days on end. 

It only comes in 5mg tablets, and the average recreational methamphetamine dose is 20-40mg smoked/snorted, so anyone taking Desoxyn as directed is perfectly safe from the classic meth abuse symptoms. 

Its actually funny that this medication, seen as the most dangerous stimulant, is the one that makes me feel the least ""high"".

TLDR: Pharmaceutical methamphetamine in therapeutic doses is quite safe, and has been much more effective than other medications at treating my anxiety as well as my ADHD.",adhd,adhd
"How do you Male ASDers feel about crying and expressing emotions? (Females ASD welcome to discuss as well) I ask because standard NT Men usually withhold their feelings, but it's said those of us on the spectrum emotions run deep.

I can say that's true for myself and I cry often, watching movies or restore faith in humanity vids on YouTube etc.

I'm unsure though how much of this is Autism, being sensitive to a lot more and how much is from CPTSD.

I used to have the usual Autistic Meltdowns when I was a kid, then at one point, I became numb. Never cried. Stone face etc. Now as an adult though and having put effort into expressing myself and expressions, I like crying. Sure it can be a bit too much at times, but I dare any man to call me a pussy or a woman or something, because I'm more than happy to put them in their place and educate them.

Do you cry? How often? Do you accept it's an important part of stress relief and feeling connected and not ending up more and more in your head?
Do you try to avoid crying? If so why?
What makes you cry?

ASDer females are welcome to talk about crying as well and any understandings may have had, experiences or struggles with tears.

Id love to hear if any of you have put in conscious effort in expressing your emotions as well.

I do use exaggerated expressions myself, because it's fun, entertaining and people actually like expressive people. Goes particular well if you're interested in humour!

"Is my husband an alcoholic? This is a throw away account due to the sensitivity of this topic.

I think my husband might have an issue, but I’m trying to not be judgmental or nag him, especially considering I occasionally have a few too many. He doesn’t drink a whole lot, or at all, during the week (Monday-Wednesday). When Thursday night rolls around, he’ll get drunk but is still able to get up and be functional at work on Friday. Friday night rolls around and he will get absolutely hammered, to the point he is still drunk in the morning when he wakes up on Saturday morning. He’ll then find a reason to start drinking in the morning, whether it is football watching, golfing, etc. he’ll start drinking again. He usually passes out around 5:00PM, but if he doesn’t pass out, he’s not much fun to be around because he is absolutely destroyed and it can become embarrassing. He’ll wake up Sunday and find a reason to have mimosas in the morning. This is repeated every weekend. During the holidays, if he has time off work, he’s been drunk for 72 hours (maybe even more) straight. 

This has been going on for 15 years and seems to be getting worse.

"I did the thing we all want to do, I outed myself to a stranger who clearly has an ED I'm a server at a restaurant. Almost every week, this TINY  old lady with a BMI just over 13 comes in and orders a glass of Chardonnay that she never finishes, and a HALF order of nachos which we have to ring in special. She never finishes her nachos. It's obvious she has an ED. One time I even said to her ""I wish I could get full that easily"" and she kind of laughed it off. 


 Today, she sits in my section but my coworker took her order cause we were confused on the shift change. I was like ""nachos?"" And she tells me ""No, she wants a side salad with chicken and fat free ranch. She says shes gained 6 pounds and she's upset about it."" 
She was super non-chalant when she told me, probably cause she can tell I have an ED too. My BMI hovers under 17, mostly fat. Thin enough for people to question it.


Well, I took that chance. 
I went up to her and said ""my coworker says you're upset that you gained 6lb, me too! Those holidays screwed me up bad."" And she just started opening up, telling me how she ate too much for the holidays, and has been eating too much ice cream at home, etc. But that her family really wants her to gain weight cause it's so dangerously low. But no more ice cream. I asked her if she had tried Halo Top. Never even heard of it. She's in her 80s and I'm sure she doesn't use the internet like us.

"DH thinks I overreact to health issues **TW - very serious health issues**


Years ago I had really bad ulcerative colitis due to stress from long-term abuse, and I ended up having to have my colon removed, which meant having an ostomy bag. At the end before I was hospitalized, I was literally dying of malnutrition and dehydration, and was suffering horribly.

I met DH 2 years later, so he’s never seen me that sick. I did develop fibromyalgia a year after we got married though, so he has seen me in excruciating pain 24/7. 

When someone has no colon and an ostomy bag, getting a stomach bug or food poisoning (diarrhea) *can be fatal* because we lose liquid and electrolytes faster than our body can absorb them. So if we take an Imodium and it doesn’t stop the diarrhea within an hour, we have to go to the ER for IVs of fluids and electrolytes *or we can die.*

Once about 5 years ago I got a bug and to go to the ER, but DH has some memory problems and doesn’t remember. 
 
In May 2015 I had a revision surgery that gave me an internal intestinal pouch that I empty with a catheter (look Ma no bag!) and last night I had bad stomach cramps for the first time since my revision. I was able to go to sleep but was woken up with even worse cramps this morning, and when I emptied my pouch I clearly had diarrhea. I got scared because I didn’t know the protocols for my type of ostomy, and my number for my surgeon was no longer a working number.

(Normally)D(ear)H was going on a hike with a friend this morning, and I quickly figured out (and confirmed) he thought I was overreacting. I got triggered and frustrated, things got uncharacteristically ugly, and he clammed up and left. 

And I’m I’m a fibromyalgia flareup and can’t drive, so if I needed to get to the hospital or go pick up a prescription I’d have to get a Lyft. 

Finally reached my surgeon and he said he’d call in a prescription for me, as well as telling me that with an internal pouch we don’t need to worry unless I have it for 24 hours. 

So here’s the deal: DH has PTSD for emotional trauma, and sometimes definitively reacts to situations in ways that someone who doesn’t have PTSD would think is an overreaction — but he still can’t seem to grasp that *I have that around health issues.* He’s tired of me “crying wolf over every little thing.”

I got so frustrated by his attitude this morning I told him to fuck off (for the first time in 12 years of marriage) when he tried to give me a kiss — before he walked out on me and after making it clear he didn’t believe me about the potential risk of a stomach bug. (We didn’t know yet so apparently my reaction was totally overboard.)

**Hello, that’s fucking PTSD!!**

At least he’s willing to go to my counseling session with me tomorrow so he can hopefully figure out how to handle these situations differently, hence why he’s a true DH.

"I might have ADHD. What next? So I tutor weekend classes and was told by one of the parents that their child had ADHD, which was what prompted me to research it. What was striking for me was that he (the child) behaved in almost exactly the same way I did when I was his age. I'd interrupt my teachers, get out of my seat, and in the times I sat still-ish I was actually daydreaming. Looking up the symptoms online I realised I checked off most of them. I thought nothing of it at the time though - I was attending a university where lectures were all recorded, so I could just go back and look through them later even if I didn't pay attention the first time. I also had a friend who would help me with notes and stuff. Sure I needed to beg my professors for project extensions - lots and *lots* of extensions, but I made it through eventually.  

The problems started to become apparent when I was learning how to drive. I'd usually do ok the first couple rounds around the training track, but the moment I got 'used' to it I'll start losing focus and making mistakes. I'll forget to put the key in the ignition, forget to change gears, etc. More lessons didn't seem to help, so now I'm taking a break from driving lessons. I'm also struggling with my masters program at a decidedly more 'traditionalistic' university, being unable to keep up with lectures. 
 
I love learning, and I want to be able to drive. If ADHD is the problem, I want to fix/surmount it. But as a grown-up (heh) it costs a significant amount to be diagnosed/treated in my country.

"Is this ptsd? Hey guys, forgive me for not doing a lot of research before posting this here. The thought just popped into my head, and I've got to get back to work so I wanted to ask while it's on my mind.

My previous job had me on call 24/7 for a little over 3 years. It was in the medical field, and if a patient or nurse called me any time, day or night, I had to respond to the call. I would work my 9+ regular hours at the office or in the field, and then several more hours a day after hours on call, not to mention every weekend.. It was a good job, but I absolutely hated that part of it. It caused me to lose a lot of friends and put a lot of hardship between me and my family because I was ALWAYS at work.

After my last day, I changed my phone number, ringtone, etc. I needed to be free. Since leaving, I have noticed that almost everyone has that ringtone. When I'm out shopping or at a restaurant and someone's phone rings with that ringtone, an almost overwhelming amount of anxiety washes over me to the point that I almost feel sick at my stomach. After 10 minutes or so, and as quickly as I can distract myself with something else, it's mostly gone but I still feel ""off"" for a while. I even still hear ""phantom"" ringing a lot, where I will be alone and think my phone is ringing but it isn't. Typing this all out makes me feel like I'm crazy or something.

"Morning Routine? I will preface this by saying that I am not a morning person AT ALL. Does anyone else find that getting to work/school in the morning early/exactly on time is absolutely impossible? I am in grad school now and somehow always seem to be 1-2 minutes late to EVERYTHING. It's not that I plan to be late, I try to plan in my head to be 10-15 minutes early to allow for delays/distractions but it never seems to work. When I was first diagnosed, my doc recommended turning my morning routine into a ""game"" with the objective being to make it to work/school EXACTLY on time without being early or late in order to ""win"". I've tried that for awhile and it helped at first but now I can never seem to ""win"" the game anymore. I think I need new strategies. 

Normally in the morning, I set a million alarms on my phone and it doesn't matter when I start them because I can't make myself get out of bed until the last possible second. Which means I'm rushing out the door and if ANY little thing goes wrong or causes me to be delayed, I'll be late (aka I can't find my phone, I forgot my watch, don't have time for breakfast, didn't account for scraping the windshield on my car, couldn't find a parking spot, got stuck on the elevator, hit every single red light, etc.... ) and all these tiny little delays add up and I can't account for them.

"Can hospitals force injection despite no history of noncompliance? Last summer I was hospitalized in Torrance, CA and the hospital really sucked. I remember going to a hearing for if I am going to be discharged or going to be stuck there. The social worker started reading off the notes in my file and there were several things that I have not said or done. For example it said that I said I will never have a supportive family when I indeed have a very supportive family. Despite that I was ordered to be kept for treatment because of my history of suicide attempts.

Anyway, before they discharged me, they really pushed me to get the Invega Sustenna injection. I have been perfectly compliant with my medication, never refused to take the meds or anything. The psychiatrist said it absorbs better than the oral pill, and will help me think more clearly. I ended up getting the injection because they made it seem like they won't discharge me if I didn't get the injection.

Out of hospital at the pharmacy, I found out the injection costs thousands of dollars ($3000 I think) and is not covered by insurance. The hospital did not reply to any faxes either. That's okay, I ended up going back to Canada. The psychiatrist in Canada stuck with the Invega Sustenna and had to fax a letter to my insurance saying this is the only treatment plan. And it is only $700 in Canada with no insurance. 

As of now I got over with all the side effects that come from injections, like pain in the site of injection and when I walk. It doesn't hurt anymore after almost a year on it. But I'm wondering if it's common for hospitals to require patients to get on an injection before they get discharged.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"victories for today cw: meal/exercise plans (but no numbers)

initially planned to start ""recovering""/eating more normally from today onwards, but chickened out last night and made more meal plans. so today I was supposed to eat berries for breakfast, have small portions of safe foods for lunch and dinner, exercise a ridiculous amount, and have fruit as ""snacks"" if necessary.

this morning I woke up craving the package of bread that my friend gave me yesterday though. after a loooong time agonising I thought, ok, I'll eat a bit of the bread and save the berries for tomorrow. but I ended up eating the berries first, though, and still got through a decent chunk of the bread. i actually felt kind of awake/energised for once! 

lunch was with my family. the veggies were some of my safe foods, but I still ate a lot more than I'd planned to. I even had a small serving of rice, because it went well with one of the dishes!

I deliberated over exercising for like 2 hours. literally. I ended up going, though, but stopped at 3/5 of my originally intended workout. which is probably why I'm not as exhausted now as I usually am this time of day :"") 

dinner was supposed to be just a small serving of the safe veggies from lunch. but I was cooking for my dad as well, and by default he wanted noodles and sauce to go with it. I wanted noodles too, even though the disordered part me of me didn't. so I thought about tabitha farrar saying that when the ed voice tells you something, the only choice available is to do the opposite. so I made some noodles for myself too. and even a bit of sauce. 

it's 11pm now and I'm kind of anxious too but I'm proud of myself. and I'm so glad that I didn't binge (because no, brain, today was relatively normal eating, not bingeing!). I'm a little hungry now but I don't think I'll eat any more tonight, *but* I will try to eat a good proper breakfast tomorrow morning.

"What methods have you used to better cope with ADHD from a physiological / biochemical perspective? Looking for ways to cope better without medication. Hey everybody,


I thought I could get a discussion going around coping mechanisms for becoming healthier with ADHD. 

Personally, I do not take medication, although I do think it is a great option for many people and see its validity.
I want to talk about things we can do to do and feel better with ADHD and have more focus and motivation for completing tasks.


I know Russell Barkley has said that cardio as well as sipping on a gatorade are helpful for people with ADHD to increase their fuel tank. I have also heard things like the Ketogenic diet and getting consistent sleep can help as well.


Some other things that might be more dubious are getting more sunlight. That's something I've been trying to do lately but I have no idea if that will help. I also struggle with depression and I've heard it is good for that.


Anyway, I want to hear your thoughts. Preferably, I want to hear about more physical things you have done that you think have an effect on your neurochemistry. I have done all too much reading on mindset stuff and think I would benefit from a more concrete action plan in the future.


Thank you so much for your time and hope to hear some cool info!",adhd,adhd

"🙃 I live with my fiancé and his whole family (mom, dad, older sister and younger brother)

His mom gifted me a rocking chair in hopes that we will have a kid and I can sit in this rocking chair and just be pregnant idk. I probably can’t get pregnant and she knows this but I love the chair. 

Hi younger brother broke it (it’s okay shit happens) but it’s still sitting in the living room and I guess yeah technically you can sit on the chair but it may fall apart. His dad is going to fix it soon, which I’m super grateful for. 

His older sister is small. Like 5’3”, skinny with IBS and disordered eating habits. I try not to compare myself since we are the same heights, but my PCOS and Endometriosis make me hideous compared to her. Not to mention huge. 

She was sitting on the chair the other day and it creeks but it still held up. I was talking to my fiancé about this, 

What I was going to say to my fiancé was “do you think I can sit in the chair? Your sister sat yesterday and it was squeaking a bit. If not can you scoot over so I can sit with you” ( he was on the couch)

What I actually got out of my mouth was “do you think I can sit in the chair? Your sister-“

And he cut me off to say “well she is like 20 pounds and you are not so....”

Ah.

I may or may not be crying in my room finding the motivation to restrict for the next 5 days nbd.

"I feel like I have no one to relate to I have PTSD from my parents divorce which happened last May. They fought a lot leading up to it, but I was never involved. Most nights I closed myself in my room and cried myself to sleep listening to them yell.

After the divorce, my mom and I moved into an apartment and I had to get rid of a lot of my stuff in the downsizing. We also had to let my dad keep our dogs, but I was never too close to them.

I feel like no one understand what I’m going through. Divorce isn’t usually the kind of thing that gives people PTSD. I don’t have flashbacks or stuff like that. I used to have night terrors but they went away. My therapist and I talk about it sometimes. She said my main symptoms are avoidance and anxiety.

I just feel really invalid because I don’t think anything bad really happened to me. Divorce is a pretty common thing. I feel like PTSD is for people who were assaulted or abused or something. Idk, thanks for reading. I just needed to put this out somewhere.",ptsd,ptsd

"I’m so confused I guess. I’m sorry if this is long. So I’ve rejoined this group.  I initially couldn’t handle the messages. 

So I’m as some that post here are, drunk. But not falling down, messed up drunk... just I’m going to check all of my social media drunk. Ya feel me? 

I’m an alcoholic. I admit that. I’ve been to AA (and all m not up for it) but I know better and I lie to my AA friends on social media. I know that. It isn’t a question. My kids hate it. I know that too. But here is the thing... my hard drinking husband , can’t admit my alcoholism. He can’t see it. He thinks I should just control it like he does. And I try but can t make him understand. 

Cut to today. I told my kids (yesterday)... who don’t mind drinking but want to micromanage mine that I wanted a few drinks while we spent several hours in the Texas heat. My husband didn’t mind. 

My husband completely through me under the bus. For full disclosure... he doesn’t give two shits if I’m a drunk, just handle my shit and if I can be his drinking BFF then life is good. 



But... no argument... I wasn’t aggressive... my daughter lost her shit over the fact that I drank more than she expected. My husband and I were talking. We were hanging out. Next thing I know... I have an impromptu intervention after hours working in our yard. And my husband was conducting it. I have a felony DWI. I’m incredibly and honestly so sorry. I understand the ramifications of this and please do not beat me up for it. I also understand legal ramifications. 

So my son told me how I felt. My daughter, who I  fought with prior to this incident, gave her two cents...  but it didn’t stop there.   He attacked me. (Remember , we were good...)I should have known better blah blah blah.   Right or wrong, I am a victim of his ex wife attacking me, because we are together. And I was previously diagnosed with PTSD.  But he basically just said he was leaving me. 

I guess the kicker is this... I’m a black out drinker. And as a black out drinker, I’m mean as fuck. Like hate. But I’m blacked out so I don’t remember. But he, as a heavy drinker, does remember.  But I am held accountable no matter what. And I still accept that. And I have not blacked out in a good bit. 

But my hubs, is all on board with me sober. Ok. I can accept. I asked for this one day, (which he is fine with because he wants a drinking buddy and we worked out doors all day! ) . I don’t want to ruin Easter. I told my kids as much.   

But I have. And he loves me “but he is leaving me” and this is a narc game he is playing.  Which is rare for him but it’s still a narc game. Because you  “(I)” caused this (not I want you to drink but control it) thing. And we fought about the reasons I drink including some of his abuse while I black out... but I am wrong no matter what. He isn’t normally that way... maybe because we are always so YES together. He doesn’t see how his drinking is an issue for me.  

And on top of that... my severely narcissistic  ex husband wants to play games.

During this... my husband got more beer and is playing his music so loud on the porch.  And I’m not invited and I have to beg him to put together Easter baskets with my already pissed off daughter/.

"Should I Get Therapy To Have Sex? (tw possibly) I(f18) got therapy three years ago when I finally told my parents about my incident. I went for one year and it's helped me think better of myself. I was molested when I was 7, and always felt out of place during my late childhood/early teens.  When I got therapy I was diagnosed with PTSD (I don't know if there's severity levels but I would think its considered a small level). After I went I didn't feel out of place as often.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had two episodes where I was triggered and I just shut down. My responses were delayed, and I was depressed for a few days. I was never depressed outside of these two events. I coped with PTSD before therapy by doing a lot of art and keeping myself busy with different things when I was in elementary.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm almost finished with my first semester of college, but I feel like I haven't accomplished much. I did a lot of activities during high school (wrestling, band, clubs) and went out of state twice. There was a lot of things that I did, but I guess socially I feel like I didn't do much. I never had sex before and I can't watch R-rated movies because I fear it'll trigger me. I know I was comfortable with an ex in high school to be willing to do it, but it never happened. I did try to have sex multiple times with other guys (after the relationship), but I couldn't handle it after they did a specific move during foreplay. I would start laughing or I'd hesitate long enough for them to get annoyed and stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I want to be comfortable enough to be willing to have casual sex, but I don't know how to proceed going along with this. Should I find a therapist for myself or wait until I get a boyfriend/SO/someone I trust and get some type of couples counseling? Or do some self help?

"Stimulant medication, masturbation and sleep (serious question) This is embarrassing but I’ve wanted to ask this for awhile. Does anyone know why this may Be happening?  Or has this happen to them too?  I’m too embarrassed to ask my doctor he is great but we have more of a professional relationship than doctor-patient because I’m in a similar field. 


Alright here we go: 

For the last two years if I masturbate before going to bed, and I have taken my meds within the last 8-12 hours, I can’t fall asleep. I’m talking after being awake for over 24 hours, being dead tired, even after taking trazadone/Xanax/any other sleep aid.  Sometimes I’ll doze for an hour and then I kick back awake. This effect can last at least six hours if not more (that’s about when I give up and get up).  Doesn’t matter how tired I am. It will even happen if I masturbate several hours before bed trying to avoid this whole thing.  

Afterwards two things usually happen, I start thinking a mile a minute but my thoughts get kind of out of my control, or my mind will feel like it’s racing but no verbal thoughts. Almost like my thoughts are just buzzing. I can’t relax enough to fall asleep. The second gets really uncomfortable because typically I’ll get caught in this 1/3rd doze where I just toss and turn all night without ever really sleeping.

Does this happen to anyone else?  Is there something about orgasms that can re-kick the remnants of the meds?  I know I could just stop getting myself off when I take my meds, but I keep hoping this will stop happening because orgasms are the best sleep aid I’ve found.  

Details on me/meds: 
I’m a lady in my late twenties, 2 years back on vyvanse 50mg with 20mg adderall IR to extend effectiveness (after a year break). Try to put at least 8-12 hours in between vyvanse doses, and 4+ between adderall.

"Potty training! And it’s not getting better! Hey everyone,

As I type this my wife and myself are trying our best to potty train our 4 year old son who has autism. Just a few days ago he took his pamper off and doesn’t let us put one on. He would start having a meltdown when he saw it. He will scream and kick us. The only time that he let us put one on is when it’s time to go to bed. So we thought maybe he wanted to do it on the potty. We guess wrong. We started with baby steps. So he only wants to peep in the bathtub, we have tried everything. I’ve even let him see me use to potty. Now it’s getting a bit worst as he is holding on doing poop. And on the second day of him hold it, it starts to come out because he is back up.

"I think I may be autistic but I have pretty good social skills Let me preface by saying I'm in the process of finding a psychologist to be properly diagnosed. 

I actually met someone who has aspergers who seemed pretty succesful, at least career wise. It got me to do a little digging on some medical research on adult autism and wow. It's like they were describing me specifically. I am 28 with a job, house, family, etc.

One key difference is that I am able to interact and pick up on social cues. I'm even a decent public speaker. I had to work hard at those things though. Years and years of practice and studying how others expect me or others to act. It's worked out pretty well and I'm used to it at this point, but it is exhausting. My wife can't understand why I get so stressed out being around people or having company for long periods. Even if my interactions seem normal and stress free.

"No Health Insurance and ADHD help Hi guys. I've been lurking in here for a while.

I think I have ADHD. 

Growing up, my family was very much of the ""you can push through anything"" approach to mental health. And it served me well for a while. I definitely feel I have 'mental fortitude' or whatever you want to call it. I could maybe go into more detail some time but the truth of the matter is I'm at work, and on short-ish time. I don't get health insurance at work, but I've suspected I've had some for of ADHD for a while now. I feel like an imposter but whenever I come in here everything makes sense in some sort of twisted way. I'm constantly losing my keys/wallet/phone. I can't stay on track. Yesterday I missed out on getting my dogs meds. I was cutting it close on closing time at the Vet, and totally just drove past my turn and kept driving for 10 minutes in my own world before I realized. I just feel stifiled. I want to do creative things but then when I start I get 1 inch in before stopping and switching gears to something else. 

I've watched some friends who have similar feelings to me get help, and actually improve their day to day life but for some reason I've had this block of going into a general practitioner or psych and saying ""I think I have ADHD"". I guess my general fear is that they'll say ""No you don't"" and this is just how I am. I dropped out of school a few years ago, and have an okay job, but I'm going back. Its yet another unfinished story in my life, but I really, really want to do it right this time. The kicker is that right now I don't have health insurance and I'm not eligible for special enrollment. Mark it down as another avoided task once I lost insurance from my last job, oh the irony.

My question is this - Am I better off just going to talk to someone without insurance and paying out of pocket? Most short term plans aren't very broad in their coverage and run high deductibles but I'm curious if having set co-pays would help offset some of my other costs. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I really don't want to wait anymore, so I will pay out of pocket, I just need to try and take care of myself while I still feel motivated to try and self help.

"Can't Follow Through with Anything I've been diagnosed with ADHD by a couple of psychiatrists but I'm not currently on any medication. I'm reaching the breaking point with a certain problem I have. I can never follow through/finish anything. While this applies to most things in my life, it is incredibly frustrating when it comes to furthering my education or developing new skills. For example, recently I decided I wanted to learn how to program. So I find a website with a free programming course and I start chipping away at it. The problem is, within 20 minutes of doing the course, it feels like someone is approaching my brain with a motivation vacuum and I eventually lose all interest in what I'm doing. Even with less mundane things it happens. I can play the guitar, though at a mediocre level and I decided recently that I want to improve my skill. I found a guitar teacher near me and started taking lessons. I wouldn't do my homework and didn't really feel like I was improving so I stopped taking my lessons. I then tried to find some online tutorials, and I even learned a couple of new techniques but like with everything else, I stopped caring about it and couldn't focus anymore. It's not like I just go back to playing video games or anything, because even with that I lose interest quickly. I used to read a lot when I was younger, but now I couldn't even pick up a book to save my life. The only thing I can seemingly do is mindlessly surf the internet, watching random videos, reading random Wikipedia articles, developing an entry-level knowledge of many different subjects, but never actually learning anything beyond that. Is this because of my ADHD or am I just completely fucking broken? It's making my life really difficult because I know what I need to do in order to escape the situation I'm currently in, but my mind/body won't fucking let me. Even writing this post was difficult because I kept getting distracted by nothing other than my own damn thoughts. All this is on top of my inability to keep jobs for longer than a month, my constant forgetfulness, and my apathetic attitude towards everything in life.

Hi. I also posted this on r/stopdrinking for more support. I’m sorry if this is long or irrelevant, but I have been having a panic attack over this for the last 8 hours and I Really need to hear/talk to people who have also been close to destroying their lives with stupid alcohol. 

For background, I am a graduate teaching assistant for the summer and also work in a research lab. 

Unfortunately, one thing that is really freaking me out is that this is my second strike. My boss for my lab pulled me aside about 4 months ago to comment that he feels alcohol has been heavily affecting my productivity and that he can smell it on me sometimes (note that he is a very strict man who is also a Mormon. I’m kind of afraid of him). He told me that I needed to see the school substance abuse counselor. I complied, and the councilor recommended me for intensive outpatient therapy and gave me a number. Honestly, I completely blew it off. I didn’t understand how my health insurance worked and didn’t feel like figuring it out. However, the topic never came up again, and I ceased having a morning beer before I went in. 

Currently I am TAing a late morning lab. Tuesday night I had WAY WAY too much to drink (first time I’ve vomited from alcohol in almost a decade). I woke up in time for my class (Definitely still probably kind of drunk), and went in. I was admittedly pretty useless as again, really hungover and probably still kind of drunk, but I thought I made it through pretty okay.  

Today, the chair of my department pulled me aside and asked to speak with me after my lab. When I did, she mentioned that she had concerns- someone (no idea who) had raised concerns that I might have a neurological issue because I was stumbling. She then told me that she had called my lab boss to express concern, and he told her about our previously conversation. She expressed to me that she is concerned about me, and that I need to be more responsible and to please just call in next time. 

Needless to say I was pretty frazzled by all of this, which is where I maybe fucked up and could have saved things? The thing is, I did/do have a neurological disease. In my early 20s I went about a year where I couldn’t walk without heavy assistance, and then spent the next several years with a pretty severe limp. I’m basically recovered, but I never regained all of my balance. Stone cold sober and not tired it isn’t a huge deal and isn’t really noticeable- I kind of sway a bit, I definitely trip, crash into things more than normal people, and don’t always walk in a straight line (I was in addiction treatment for a DUI right around the time that I was diagnosed with this disease, and it took a crazy amount of convincing, including being breathalyzed and drug tested, to convince the councilors I wasn’t inebriated). I also lean on things and stand in a certain way to minimize falling over.  When I’m drunk, hungover, sick, whatever it gets way way worse. I thought I was doing pretty okay yesterday, but I Wasn’t concentrating on it nearly as much as I would, so I was stumbling more. I SHOULD have disclosed this to the chair. I really should have, but a mixture of me hating talking about it (I was told I would never walk again) and being totally blindsided, it didn’t really cross my mind. 

Anyway, I apologized profusely for my unprofessionalism and assured her it wouldn’t happen again. Within two hours of our meeting I had figured out my healthcare insurance and had an appointment with a therapist for their earliest possible appointment. I then emailed the chair to apologize again and let her know that I was taking appropriate action to remedy the situation. 

I’m kind of considering telling her about my disease tomorrow, but at this point I worry it may look like I’m making excuses, PLUS I want to talk about this as little as possible. 

What I’m now super concerned about is my boss. Again, this is my second strike with him and he is also very image conscious (he likes that his is the most prestigious lab). He is on vacation until next week, so I have like a week to stew over this. I don’t THINK he will fire me, but I have definitely lost a lot of his trust so that doesn’t bode well. Either way it is going to be a very uncomfortable and painful talk as he really is the ‘lecturing’ type. 

So, there you go. I’m freaking out. In 1 hour I managed to apparently humiliate myself, lose the respect of three of my mentors, and put my job and education at risk. 

This is all still very fresh, but I don’t know what else I can do.

"Advice needed on helping an alcoholic coworker please. So I manage a coworker, a friend for 10 years, and he had a relapse earlier in the year. Called in sick on Monday and Tuesday, then called an admitted it was a problem and he'd fallen off the wagon. 

He did a seven day residential course and went on anti-alcohol meds. It seemed to be working but I'm now worried. Last Monday he called in to work from home because he had a migraine. This Monday he called in sick with stomach problems and turned in very poor work indeed.

I worry he's relapsing and don't know what to do. If I call him out on it and tell him to sort this out do I risk sending him into a shame spiral? On the other hand, what if I'm wrong? I don't want to hide any problems but I need some answers - my boss is getting suspicious and I'm running out of excuses. What would be the best way to approach him about it?

"Had a confusing/upsetting experience with getting evaluated for ADHD. Is this a normal-ish way for a diagnosis to go? TLDR: Was told high WAIS scores indicated that my symptoms of adhd were probably the result of boredom. Not sure how to feel about it as symptoms continue to cause problems.

Brief backstory: I'm in college, have family history + symptoms of ADHD, and am usually labeled as a ""smart"" kid (is relevent, not trying to be a douche-nugget). 

I've been struggling with classes much more recently than in the past, and had to quit my part time job. I just didn't ever sit down to do work, so I  ended up unhealthily stressed out and never got my tasks done. During that same time, I barely passed several of my classes.

So I went to get evaluated because of the family history, work, school, and other, lesser symptoms. The conclusion was that while I posses a range of symptoms of ADHD, ""it is common for individuals to present seemingly pathological tendencies under conditions in which there is an over reliance on one or more particular strengths."" In context, the ""strengths"" are my high IQ scores (again, not trying to be a douche- sorry). The analysis basically goes onto say that none of my WAIS results were below average, even if some were lower than others (27 point spread). They recommended the book ""Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnosis of Gifted Children"" by Webb and said I was probably ""just bored.""

That was upsetting, but I tried to take it in stride and accept it.

Fast forward to now: Despite a much lighter schedule, I'm failing half my classes (the ""easy"" ones, primarily) and getting more and more unhappy.

I know they're medical professionals and I'm just some kid, but I'm increasingly questioning that diagnosis. Have any of you had or heard of similar experiences? Do you think it would be fair to seek a second opinion if I'm still uncomfortable with it?

Thanks all!",adhd,adhd
"Is it possible that i have a mild form of schizophrenia? Hey everyone, so I had a few symptoms that match up with those from schizo so I was wondering if possibly I have a mild version.

This happens sometimes where I'm thinking about something private and I suddenly try not to think about it in case anyone sees. I'm aware that it's completely irrational but I feel like my head is leaking. 

Also, when I was younger, I frequently confused my thoughts with dreams. Even now, when I try to remember something, I can't figure out if it's a dream or not. 

I also sometimes get the feeling that I'm in a simulation and that I'm being watched for no apparent reason.

I also sometimes ponder the possibility of things like me being insanely retarded, too much so to realize it and my friends only play along because it's funny.

I occasionally get dissociative episodes where I feel like I'm watching myself from a third person view, like I'm playing a video game and I'm controlling my avatar from behind the screen.

I do have a particular person I’d take a bullet for without a second thought. He’s my fiancé. We just got engaged after dating for 7 years, and he was my best friend prior. He tells me I can talk to him whenever I’m afraid (his brother has schizophrenia, so he understands) but I’m terrified I’m going to mess up.
My paranoia has eased off slightly. I used to not be able to look in mirrors or use the computer because they would watch me through it. I’d get hives and panic attacks whenever I was in public. Since getting on lithium there’s been improvement.

The full story:

Not our first time to this show but, a few weeks ago I talked to my husband about his drinking which was getting out of hand. He claims it was just the one time (I know, I know, it wasn’t one time) but agreed to get help and said he’d stop drinking again. But he won’t tell any one else about this. For instance, he told his brother he wasn’t drinking because he’s on a diet with me. 

Yesterday he had his first appointment with a therapist, and told me he felt really good about his sobriety. Tonight he got sauced. After some incoherent chatter and adamant insistence that he hadn’t drank a thing, he passed out and I went hunting for evidence that I wasn’t crazy . Ive found several garbage bags full of empties. I realize it’s worse than I thought. 

Is it ok for me to tell his family? I have a 10 month old baby and I can’t take care of her and him all by myself. I know he’ll be furious and I can accept that but I don’t want to undermine his recovery and therapy. Is it only his story to tell?

"In the psych ward right now :( any words of encouragement? I need them. I'm currently in the psych ward. We are allowed to use our cell phones for 2 hours every day, so this is from my phone.

I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia a few years ago. I basically had a psychotic break at school. I still don't fully understand what happened, but I was called out from class and the police took me to the hospital. I asked my fiance what happened to me, but he said I don't need to worry about that now and he'll tell me once I'm more stable/in a good state of mind. 

They got me stabilized after a few days. I'm feeling much better. They were late on giving me my cogentin for the first few days so I had to deal with the tremors and muscle rigidity etc. but now I'm on track.

It is just so depressing here. I tend to sleep all day. And there is this one guy here who will NOT shut the fuck up about some ex ""girlfriend"" whose house he broke into 3 times, all the times they had sex, etc. He just never shuts up about it, even though me and the other patients have told him to cool it.

"What to call myself / my mental illness? So I had my first psychotic episode last year and ended up in the psych ward but I did not receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia despite being put on an anti-psychotic for about 8 months. Now that I’m off medication my life’s improved, however I still struggle with what I’d describe as negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as cognitive issues. If I smoke weed I get pretty fucked up and depressing thoughts rushing in and none of the enjoyment I used to have before my episode, so I’ve stopped that, especially being off antipsychotics it’s too risky. Although I maybe wouldn’t call it a voice (and I have had voices so I know what that’s like) I pretty much live with this impulse — or maybe it’s like an intrusive thought? — to attack people when I’m in social situations or even just walking past people on the street... it actually makes me flinch when it happens and I often feel like I have to clench my fists or put my hands in my pockets. Goes without saying probably but I would never act on these thoughts. I also get startled on occasion by things in the corner of my vision, but my “hallucinations” are extremely light, more like momentarily misreading things around me.

So that’s me, and I know I don’t have it nearly as rough as a lot of people, but I do feel I’m living with something that impacts my life. But without positive symptoms rearing their heads unless I’m high or worse tripping, and without an actual diagnosis of schizophrenia, I don’t really know what to call myself. I thought of “psychosis survivor” but it sounds more than a little dramatic, and to be honest it really would just be easier to call myself schizophrenic or mildly schizophrenic, but then again I don’t want to be diminishing the experience of schizophrenic and schizo-affective people who’ve had multiple episodes, live with frequent voices and visual hallucinations, are taking heavy doses of medication, dealing with tardive dyskinesia from said medication, etc.

I guess what I’m asking is, is it okay for me to call myself schizophrenic? Also, I’m wondering what you guys think of using the word “schizo” to refer to yourselves/ourselves. I’m a poet and have used the word in something I’m writing, and I think that’s maybe where some of these insecure identity thoughts are coming from.

"my dad has ptsd that he won’t treat and i don’t know if i want a relationship with him anymore. i’m in need of some advice regarding my dad. 

here’s a bit of a backstory:
my dad has been a volunteer firefighter for about 9 years and as a result he was the first responder on scene when his best friend died about two years ago. he also was a victim of a hit and run about five years so needless to say he has a lot he needs to work through. on top of this, he was recently caught cheating in an emotional affair (at least he claims that’s all it was) and after months of my mom trying to save the marriage and getting nothing in return from my dad, she filed for divorce. since then he has been an absolute nightmare to interact with, every phone call with him ends in me crying, he calls me names and claims that i don’t care about him or love him, he has cut me and my brother out of his will, tries to guilt trip me about things out of my control/things i never did, spends all of his free time trashing my mom despite my pleas that he stops, etc. 

in regards to his ptsd, he was diagnosed right around the same time my mom found out he was cheating. he went to two, maybe three therapy appointments and took meds for about a month then claimed he was “fine” and quit all of his treatment cold turkey. this was when every interaction with him began to go downhill. i tried in the beginning to bring up the idea of going to therapy again, asking if he’s feeling better or worse without his meds, etc. and always get the same response that he doesn’t have ptsd and has no issues, yet his flip in behaviour says otherwise. forgive me if this isn’t correct in terms of symptoms of ptsd, i’m only going off of what i know, which is admittedly not a lot (hence me asking for advice). 

in short, i don’t know how to have a relationship with this angry and belittling man who is a polar opposite of the dad i had when i was growing up. i don’t know if it’s worth fighting for this relationship anymore and if any of you have been in similar situations i would really appreciate the input.",ptsd,ptsd

"Ok fellow autism parents, I need advice This is going to be a long one so bare with me. 

I have an 11 year old autistic son (kiddo). He is almost to level 2, but diagnosed officially with level 1. He is in ABA-inhome therapy which is helping immensely. The therapist and I have worked out a weekend schedule that works. She says I have come so far in learning how to handle kiddo. My husband (DH) on the other hand, trying to train him is like banging our heads against a brick wall. So I was the one primarily taking care of kiddo.

Due to the government shutdown back in December I have had to get a job. I am working the 3pm-11pm or 9pm-6am shift at the gas station a block from my house. During the week DH has been pretty good about sticking to the schedule for kiddo. The only fighting is over homework or eating dinner. 

The weekends are a complete disaster. DH tries to make deals with him about chores and reading. When I point out the schedule (which is printed and posted on the fridge) kiddo throws a fit saying that DH said he didn't have to do xyz chore. DH yells at kiddo for not listening, doing what he wants, shutting down, and throwing a temper tantrum which in turn makes kiddo shutdown even more and DH starts yelling louder. It is a complete nightmare. 

This is an every single day thing. DH tries to cut corners and kiddo plays one parent against another to get his way. So when this happens DH and I start arguing and kiddo is off doing his own thing. 

Ok, so here's an example. 

Kiddo's schedule for Saturday: by 10am he has to make his bed and start his laundry. 11:40am he eats lunch and puts his laundry in the dryer. At 1pm he folds and puts away his laundry. At 3:30pm he takes his medicine and eats a snack. At 4pm he gets the mail then reads for 30 mins. THEN he can have his tablet. 

So apparently yesterday while I was at work, DH tells kiddo that he has to read only once this weekend and that he can have his tablet after he eats breakfast. 

So I didn't know that and DH didn't follow the schedule. When I woke up at 8am this morning kiddo immediately asks for his tablet. I asked him if he had made his bed or started his laundry. Kiddo blatantly lies to me (the laundry room is right next to the living room where I am sitting and I can see the washer door is still open) then tells me that DH said he didn't have to do any of that this weekend. I tell kiddo he has to follow his schedule, no matter what anyone else says. Kiddo starts having a meltdown and asks for a break (one of the best things the therapist and I have gotten him to do). While kiddo is sitting on the couch taking a 3 minute break I am sitting here dumbfounded wondering why the hell DH would say that. 

During kiddo's break DH comes downstairs to go to the insurance company and kiddo starts throwing a temper tantrum. I turned to him and said that kiddo has to follow his schedule no matter if it is a long weekend or not. So now I'm the bad guy because I am making kiddo stick to the schedule. DH leaves to go to the insurance company and ***OMG*** kiddo starts following his schedule. I would say I am shocked, but I'm really not. Kiddo knows that momma won't put up with his bullshit. There is a schedule and rules for a reason. Kiddo knows that his life is much smoother when I am the one mainly taking care of him. 

So here's my dilemma:

1) should I continue working. We could use the money to catch up but we don't NEED the money. During the hours I work I know that DH will continue to cut corners and make life hell for kiddo. 

Or

2) quit the job that I actually like and go back to being a stay at home mom. 

I have no idea what to do.

"Drug induced hallucinations Hi everyone, I've never been diagnosed as psychotic, but the other day I had some weird but not super scary hallucinations. In my periphery I saw a hand draw back a shower curtain. Later I heard my ringtone but when I found my phone no one had called. 

For context, I'm taking Adderall, Lexapro, and Abilify for ADHD, anxiety and depression. I had some restlessness in my legs, and was prescribed Cogentin to counteract the jittery feeling that might have been a side effect of the Abilify. A few days later I had the hallucinations, a possible side effect my psychiatrist didn't mention.

I guess my question is, since hallucinations are a fairly rare side effect, do I have an increased likelihood of psychosis later in life? I've always been scared about developing a severe mental illness, since my dad's sister is a felon with schizoaffective disorder, so I'm genetically predisposed. And a lot of my symptoms overlap with the schizophrenic prodrome. Should I look into preventative medicine?",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
Requirements of ptsd. I am applying for a medical card and I put down I am diagnosed with severe depression but the women with the cards said I would need it to be ptsd based depression. I’ve never been diagnosed with that but could very much believe I would be a candidate. When I was eight my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and I watched her go through treatments and have a allergic reaction to those treatments. She ended up in the hospital for a month and almost died. I then had a big fight with her when I was 14 and I found out she had a heart attack the next day and needed major heart surgery. ,ptsd,ptsd

Cant make an appointment or follow through to save my life Ive got ADHD SAD ASD and sleeping issues (because why not) i have health insurance and even dental insurance but my ability to use it is basically non existent. Right now im extremely depressed and borderline suicidal all because i cant eat and need two root canals....that ive known i needed for two years. Everytime I get a referral from my primary care (which i only have because my moms new insurance assigned me one or else I’d still be without a primary care doctor)  i want to cry because it’ll be months if not years before i can get myself to call to make the appointments. Occasionally ive even resorted to asking my mother to make appointments for me but shes as likely to snap at me as she is to help. I finally got a root canal appointment yesterday only to leave without getting my tooth treated when i had my first panic attack and started crying for my mom. I received the paperwork to fill out to apply for my states ASD services several months ago but i havent even started on them. Im drowning under the amount of appointments i need to make and follow up on but at the rate im going it’ll be several years just to get an optometrist appointment. Im extremely suicidal not because i want to die but because i cannot figure out how the hell to do the basic things i need to live. A large part of why im still breathing is because most suicide plans like appointments require me to follow through. Im at the end of my rope. My current tooth treatment plan involves waiting for the giant holes in my mouth to turn septic and send me to the emergency room which is down the street and doesn’t require me slogging through a list of providers and trying to find out how much a place charges for a damn root canal. I know thats just a temporary solution and they’ll probably tell me to follow up with a dentist after treatment but its legitimately like the only option i have right now. ,autism,autism
"I think I've ""oppositioned"" myself out of eating... any help w/ ADHD and trouble eating? So basically I've always had trouble eating (I've had trouble w/ nausea and GI pain since high school - or just plain forgetting) but I'll go through cycles where I barely eat for a few weeks then eat a lot for a few weeks. that being said - I love food and I love cooking!
This summer I lost a lot of weight from being sick and gaining back weight became a focus for me - once I was prescribed stimulants it became even more of a focus. But yet even when I was hungry I just couldn't bring myself to eat! 
I recognized a few weeks ago that I think I'm oppositional to food now! Because I made it a ""chore"" (IE ""you need to gain weight, so you need to eat this"") my a**hole ADHD brain goes ""no!"" just like when I ""tell it"" to do any other chore. Like literally I was hungry, didn't want to eat anything so got myself a BOWL OF ICE-CREAM and when I told myself to eat it I realized I felt THE EXACT SAME WAY as when I say - tell myself to start studying or pick up my room. 

I think I've made myself oppositional to food because now it's a ""requirement"" and I don't know what to do about it - every time I eat I just feel like crap - like my body is rejecting the food. Even when I don't take meds (I went off them for about a week and a half) I just can't bring myself to eat! I've literally been dipping in and out of an anorexic BMI for the last few weeks and I don't know what to do.

"Retail and food&amp;bev aren't compatible with my mental wellbeing, but I'm struggling to find work in my field. What are other low skilled jobs I can try for that will ease my symptoms until something better comes along? I am not officially diagnosed, but have an appointment for it with my psychiatrist this morning.

I graduated from college last May and took a job that I loved with a great company. Unfortunately, they began corporate wide restructuring and after being employed with them for 4 months, they eliminated my department. I had 9 months of experience with them (5 months of an internship, and 4 months full time), but I keep getting rejected from every job I have interviewed and applied for. I've been stuck in retail since I got laid off and it is really wearing me down since I did it all through college with the hopes that college would land me a better job, now only to end up back in it. The rejection and failure stings.

I'm currently working as a retail pharmacy technician and I hate my job. I dread going into work every day I'm scheduled to the point that I get nauseous and depressed and end up crying for non reason those days. I live for my days off and am so miserable that I'm close to impulsively quitting, but financially I can't because I'm already breaking even and into the negatives.

I make a lot of mistakes at work and it really tires me out because I have to count pills, stop that to help drive thru or the counter if someone walks up, deal with insurance companies, deal with a delete list, deal with the call list, deal with restocking. It's like I get pulled in ten different directions at a time and it leads to me forgetting things and making mistakes. Dealing with rude and just customers in general really tires me out and makes me exhausted. I come home from work and go straight to bed because I'm so drained.

I think I should try to apply for another low skilled job that's a better fit for my symptoms until I can get another job using my degree. What are some other low skilled jobs that pay decently (I currently make $12.50 an hour) that don't have a lot of customer interaction or constant movement back and forth from task to task?

**TL;DR I hate my retail job and make a lot of mistakes because I'm required to bounce back and forth between tasks and drop them in the middle of them and then come back and pick them up.

"Careless Errors - Advice on preventing or catching them Hi all, I'm a long time reader and beneficiary from the fantastic resource here, I can't express my gratitude enough. Recently diagnosed and appreciating the benefits of medication, however, still fine-tuning dosage while working through coaching.

I've long struggled with making careless errors and the feeling of tremendous guilt with making such oversights, with the associated feelings of judgement and disappointment from others, possibly the RSD I've read about here. I'm wondering if others have developed habits or ways to catch these before they take hold in a meaningful way. The coaching has advised stepping away, taking a few moments to disassociate from the task (taking a walk, implementing meditation in place, getting a glass of water, etc.) and coming back with a fresh look - however I find this extremely difficult, if not impossible to implement in practice.

I've always struggled with impulse control, failing to review (or even fully read/complete) tests, review work submissions, edit written work etc., including stopping at 1,2, 8 drinks, or just being in control. Starting work again after several years off, after being let-go for these kinds of careless errors, and very concerned that I haven't yet found a solution.

"Vyvanse Dependence /Depression. I feel like a shell of a person. Hello. 16F here. I have been treated for my ADHD with various doses of Vyvanse for the past several years and I currently am prescribed 50 mg.

I abused and misused my medication this summer. Going back to school, I was no longer able to do that and I had to go back to my intended dosage. The adjustment was very difficult, and I completely withdrew from friends, would sleep excessively (5/3pm-6am most nights), and felt very fatigued and indifferent for about a month until I finally got used to being back on my intended dose. Still not sure if what I was feeling was withdrawal or not

I have never brought this up with my mental health provider in fear of losing her trust and fear of being taken off Vyvanse.

On December 8th my father died. I had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff). He lived in another country at the time of his passing, so I missed the last weeks of school to be with his family in his home country and I arrived back in the states on Xmas.

I cannot be around my friends without Vyvanse. I zone out in my own thoughts, I resent them and find no joy in being around them. I feel so disconnected and alone from them, even though they are supportive. On New Years, I was at a close friends get together and I felt like this and I went to the bathroom and for the first time had intense urges to self-harm. Called home, left the party, and got drunk alone instead.

As you all probably already know, adhd medication does wonders for grades and it also does wonders in social situations. I can talk to people with so much confidence, I’m chattery and peppy and empathetic while on it. Like Im the best version of myself. 

**I feel like I live in these two worlds as who I am medicated and who I am not medicated.** Nobody knows the real me because of how different my personality is on Vyvanse, even I don’t know the “real” me I've been on this drug so long. When I crash from Vyvanse now, I feel like Im in a dark deep hole. When I'm not on Vyvanse, I'm dissatisfied with everyone and everything around me, including myself. the only time I'm happy is when im on amphetamines.

i cannot sleep anymore and I get about two hours every night. no sex drive at all off vyv and I am losing all my friends. I am just so exhausted.

i feel like an incomplete person without Vyvanse. How do you all deal with this? And have any of you been diagnosed with depression *after* being diagnosed with ADD? Considering that might be an option. ",adhd,adhd
"Tips for treating nightmares that aren't cannabis? Hi guys. First time posting here. Haven't had a flashback in over two years, my life's going great (comparatively), etc, but the nightmares have never slowed down.

I've used cannabis with FANTASTIC results to treat them for over five years, with long breaks here and there for various reasons. I take two to three tokes before bed and sleep without waking up in fear and disgust, or feeling disturbed the entire next day. It's fantastic. It's the only time I use except for rare occasions when the kids are gone and I have the house to myself. But I'm pregnant again and I'm so damn exhausted. I'll lay in bed ""sleeping"" for nine hours and feel completely unrested. They're relentless and sometimes I can't get a particularly bad one out of my mind for DAYS. The feelings of worthlessness and paranoia are steadily mounting again and I think this has a lot to do with it, combined with my hormones.

I've tried meditation before bed and after waking up at night, sleeping medication my baby doc approved that made them more vivid, incense, various teas, etc. I even re-tried all the diet changes that I tried with no success years ago. No dice. MY OB doesn't seem to be taking me seriously, which I'm used to. Pretty sure he thinks I'm whining because I can't get stoned but I don't even use recreationally save for maybe a couple times a month.

"ways to describe what the autism state of consciousness really is, what it feels like? * Observing everyone around you talking to each other and loving looking at each other's faces, and can't understand what impulse they are feeling to make them want to do that.

* Observing groups endlessly chat for an hour and being astounded that they can carry on a chain of topics for that long, when you can't even put together a response for ""what's up""
* Being able to see some things from the perspective from an alien, e.g. the absurdity of the fact that 99% of males have short hair, and 99% of females have long hair, but normal ppl just accept that's how it is and don't question it. biology should be unrelated to appearance grooming
* Like individual parts of the brain are very wired, but don't communicate with each other enough
* Taking a long time to figure out things that are common sense for everyone else.

"Tapering Off Whiskey After 10 Years - Help! &amp;#x200B;

Hey Guys,

So I'm sort of new to this Sub in the sense that I've read a lot of posts but never actually posted.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I'm about to start an alcohol taper.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a short story long, here's my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Brief History: 35 years old, very active, married, 2 kids.  

&amp;#x200B;

**My Drinking Habits:**  I've been drinking daily for about 10 years now.  I won't get into the history to much, but I used to (like 2 - 3 years back) drink to blackout about once or twice a week, and then just in moderation (ie about 10 drinks / daily) the rest of the weekdays.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last year or so, I've been drinking around 7 - 8 a night.  A drink for me is really about 3 drinks, with about 2.5 shots of whiskey mixed with diet coke.  

&amp;#x200B;

In total, it's about 350 ml of whiskey per night, spread out over 4 hours or so.

&amp;#x200B;

There are days that I will have an occasional couple of beers during the day, almost exclusively on the weekends.  

&amp;#x200B;

Compounding this problem has been Adderall use.  I'm prescribed 10 mg Adderall XR, which I take daily.

&amp;#x200B;

When I think about it, my ADHD was caused by my drinking, which is why I started taking the Adderall in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I've put myself in a constant cycle of dependency with the adderall / alcohol....I wake up hungover, and Adderall lifts the fog.  I struggle to fall asleep at night because of the Adderall, so I drink whiskey.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence the cycle....

&amp;#x200B;

Other than my hangover (which I realize is technically 'withdrawal'), I do not experience any other alcohol withdrawal symptoms. (such as shakes, raised BP, etc.).  With that said, I haven't gone through a period of more than 16 - 18 hours or so until I have my next drink.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ready and willing to get myself out of this cycle, which is where the taper has come in.

&amp;#x200B;

My Plan:  I am going to do a quick taper off of the adderall.  I've tapered off it before in the past, and while the first week sucks, life does seem to get normal eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the whiskey, I was thinking about doing it over the course of about 2 weeks, dropping by about 50 ml every few days.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest concern is, given my history of drinking everyday for close to 10 years, is an at-home taper safe?

&amp;#x200B;

Is a 2 week taper realistic?  Should I make it shorter / longer?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I have access to Ativan and clonidine, but I don't plan on taking either unless absolutely necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated, thanks for listening!

&amp;#x200B;

And I’m always told I have my grandmothers body.

"Will I finally learn this time? I've had intermittent problems stemming from alcohol for all of my adult life. Legal issues, relationships failing, work impacted, kinda the whole nine yards. 

Sometimes I can have a few drinks socially and have a great time like everyone around me. Sometimes, when I'm hurting I can get to the level of being numb without going over the edge. 

Other times I lose all semblance of control and blackout. Over and over. Recently we had a white board on the fridge keeping track of days since last blackout incident. It started as a joke but the reality was anything but funny. 

I'd been going hard daily and it was only fueling my self-destructive tailspin. The numbness that I sought was nowhere to be found, instead I sank into misery. Where did my sometimes go?!? 

Sometimes is a double edged sword. And if I keep cutting myself on it I'm going to bleed out. 

So, I've been sober for 8 days. I'm doing alright for the most part. The time I would have spent drinking I'm trying to use to exercise. 

Hopefully I'll learn to care for myself more if I treat myself like I matter. Hopefully I'll be able to finally deal with all the emotional baggage I've struggled so long to ignore. Hopefully I'll feel better as I go. Hopefully I can do the things I want and break through the fears that hold me back.

Hopefully this time I'll learn that alcohol is not my friend. ",alcoholism,alcoholism
"My mother is beginning to show signs of an episode.. My mother has a significant history of schizophrenia. Her last major episode was last year after not staying compliant on her medication. She locked herself in a vacant house and assaulted a police officer.

I noticed that she hasn’t been sleeping well. Instead of sleeping in her room, she’s been sleeping in the living room with all of the blinds closed (unusual for her). She called her doctor earlier in the week and requested Haldol 5mg which she has since been taking twice daily. Beforehand, she was taking risperidone, which has evidently stopped working for her.

I hear her whisper to herself when she thinks no one is paying attention. My sister and I got her to call a mobile crisis center out of concern for her. She set them up with her information but doesn’t think she needs it right now. She smokes and has been smoking inside when she normally smokes in the garage. I assume she’s afraid to go outside.

We have my 7 mo old daughter at home with my fiancé. I don’t know how to work around her smoking inside. I don’t know if the Haldol needs a few days to begin showing effectiveness.

Any advice? I don’t want to force her into treatment. She’s been proactive with knowing her old medicine wasn’t working. She knows something isn’t right. She called the crisis center by herself. I just don’t want anything to happen knowing my daughter is at home, and I work often.

"It snuck up on me. I need advice but I refuse to get professional help I've come to the realization that my drinking has gotten out of control. Not in the sense of quantity but frequency.

"A letter to my father. I'm hesitant to hit send. Okay, I just want to preface with this: I'm trying to only get you to see a different perspective, not force my views on you. Whether or not you change your mind, that's up to you. Your views likely won't change, and I understand. You have made your thoughts clear multiple times. 

The one thing that you said yesterday that really upset me was that you regret getting us vaccinated when speaking to us in the heat of the moment. And when we asked what you meant by that, you couldn't give an answer. That hurt. It left me confused. I didn't know what you meant by it, but what I could gather from the context of our conversation was that you felt some kind of shame. Why else would you say that? I have autism. Your son doesn't. It didn't make sense to me.

I'm not expecting an apology. I just want you to know that what you said hurt. Maybe you didn't mean it. Maybe you just spoke out of pure emotional reaction. I want to give the benefit of the doubt. You as a parent can make the decisions you want to shape your children's lives; ultimately it's up to you, and then when they're a little older and have some autonomy, the children. I know you said you only avoid one vaccine, the one for MMR. I don't  want to have a debate. I just want to show you what I have read and seen and lived, for you to take that in with an open mind, and that's it. 

One of the major issues I have regarding this ""vaccines cause autism"" belief is what it, in direct and indirect ways, does to people with autism. How neurotypical people with little information and/or a negative view on people with autism treat them. I will send you videos and articles of autistic people speaking for themselves. Of people that lead relatively typical, average lives. Of parents that care for their autistic children and celebrate their child's different way of taking in and taking on the world around them. Of the challenges they all face. I want to show you that autism does not come about suddenly the next day, as you implied with the story of your cousin's child who you said was vibrant and alive and then completely changed the following day after he got a vaccine. Autism shows itself over time and is usually diagnosed around the time children would normally get vaccinated. The vaccines don't cause it. The symptoms show on a spectrum, where you get people that can't live on their own, need a caretaker, maybe just need some classes that help them develop their own life skills so they could live with minimal to no assistance, or sometimes they don't get any of that at all but they do still face some challenges, like I have. 

When many people think of autism, the picture that comes to mind are the kids that can't speak, that can't take care of themselves, that make ""strange"" movements with their hands, that rock back and forth, that throw tantrums all the time because they're going through intense sensory overload. That's the picture that is painted much of the time in the media. I understand that image seems daunting to other parents. I understand it can be difficult for some to care for a special needs child, financially and emotionally. Children as a whole are challenging to raise as it is. 

But they're children, they're human in the end like everyone else, and they deserve respect and love once the people who have them bring them into this world... whether they planned for those children or not. They don't deserve to be feared, pitied, or treated like an ""other."" A lot of the people that use autism to scare others aren't doing any justice to the people born with it. Autism is not a disease. It's just another way of experiencing the world.",autism,autism
"Breaking the habit/cycle I've known for a while about this cycle/habit I have think others can relate , where life is more in the dumps then usuall, so you read up about all these things that can help you, learn online etc

So I put them into practice to help myself , start excercising more, do mindfullness and other stuff, it's really hard to start with but I start doing it more and more 

And then I have a good day, life feels good feel hopeful, and for some reason after experiencing this I soon stop doing those things any excuse e.g. cold or assignment and then I start to collapse under life again and be more in the dumps 

Proud to say for the first time I realised I was collapsing/stopped doing the good things. So I fought through excuses I made (I had a cold/leg hurt, could do the stuff tommmorow) and now back on track

"I’m just really upset. ED related and also not. I’m on day four of a five day fast and I feel so fucking shitty and tired and achey and frustrated because I’m hungry.

My dog has been having diarrhea for over a week now and I finally got him in at the vet today and they treated me like I was fucking stupid. The fuckinng cunt old lady vet tech tried to get a sample but was like “We couldn’t really get much of a sample, mAyBe He WeNt BeFoRe CoMiNg iN” and gave me a dirty look like it was my fault. Like no lady, he was shitting his guts out hourly last night and he actually didn’t go before coming in.

And then the actual vet was like “Oh well maybe put some pumpkin in his food.” I’ve been doing that. “Oh well maybe he’ll benefit from a probiotic.” I’ve been giving him one.

What did I leave with? A probiotic and a dewormer he might not even need. I kept telling them it might be a food allergy or lactose intolerance because of the Kong puppy cheese or maybe he has irritable bowels or giardiasis but noooooo take this probiotic and if he isn’t better in ANOTHER WEEK (of diarrhea. in a puppy. That’s not fucking good to have for an extended period of time), THEN I can take him back and we’ll “re-evaluate”.

But then. The dewormer. No way am I getting it shoved down his throat, so I crush it up and roll it inside some ham. He decides suddenly he doesn’t like ham. I pick apart the ham (THAT SMELLS SO GOOD) into little bits. He doesn’t want it. I mix it in with his food. Doesn’t want it. I top his food with treats. He picks out the treats. So I shove it all into a blender and make it soft food. He doesn’t want it. I mix it with water to make puppy stew. Still won’t fucking touch it. So congrats to me, I’m a failure dog mom because I ruined his medicine. I don’t know why they isn’t just give us a liquid version. I guess I’ll have to actually go outside to the S T O R E where there’s F O O D and give it to him. Maybe I’ll order it on amazon. Idk.

And then I take him out. I come back. One of the cats knocked off the box of ham and it’s all in the floor. It made me what to fucking cry. Perfectly good ham. A mostly full box of it. Thrown away.

Does anyone else get just angry and irritable like this? Like I want to throw shit at the walls. And I’m so worried for my dog. I just want him to not hurt. And I feel like I’m not good enough.

"I am so f*cking tired **TLDR; I'm really exhausted and tired. I don't know why, I don't know how, this is me wailing into the ~~abyss~~ subreddit of ADHD.** 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm like a computer. When I wake up, that's the alarm clock pushing my power button - a signal that it's time for me to turn on and get ready. Usually I wake up, take my meds (Elevanse/Vyanse/Lisdexamphetamnine), drink my high caffeine tea, and then I slowly I activate. Two hours later, I am ready to complete any tasks at hand. 

&amp;nbsp;

But then there are periods like these. The alarm clock presses my power button, I take my meds, drink my high caffeine tea (two cups), but my screen stays pitch black. It's like I can't get past Hibernate mode. I can't turn on, I'm not able to take on any tasks handed to me by the world. I just stay tired and zombie like.  I'm not only tired, but exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

The result is that I either stay in bed, or fall onto the couch. Either way I don't leave my home. As expected, I can't stop thinking about everything I have to do and all that I'm wasting, but no matter how much anxiety and stress I experience, my brain refuses to turn on, and I don't know how I'm supposed to activate it. I don't know where the power button is. 

&amp;nbsp;

To clarify (for anyone that's still reading this moany mess of a post), I do sleep. Albeit, yes, I probably need to sleep for 9 hrs rather than 8 hrs, but theoretically I'm not lacking in the sleep department. I've taken blood tests before and they've always looked great. So why can't I just wake up like so many others? Why can't I just turn my power on?

My name is Gia and I’ve had a pretty traumatic life. My Father ran one of the biggest functioning carnivals in the States and I travelled to a new city every month as a child.

"Triggered by someone who I should excuse? NSFW TW Sexual assault mention 

Not sure where else to talk about this at this point so I made a throwaway.

The mutual friend who made the post where the incident occurred told me several people have talked to the stranger and explained why this was wrong and inappropriate.

"My dad is an alcoholic and im out of ideas how to help him. Hi everyone! I want to share my story with you. Mostly because alcoholism of my dad sort of shaped me. Made me who I am today. But instead of talking about my life, im just curious if anyone every happened to deal with something similar or has any advice. Im gonna turn 18 in 5 days, and in about 2 years move from my home to a different country so i already gave up on my dad but if any of you dealt with something like this/can provide advice, i would gladly read it. Let's get to my story.   


Im after 7 years of depression proven my psychiatrist. Demons of the past, still haunt me sometimes but with time i learnt to deal with them. My dad is an alcoholic, he's a profesional soldier. He's a colonel in my country and is just one step under, the  Ministry of National Defense. So yea, he earns quite a lot, wouldn't call him rich, but he definietely lives better than an average person.   
He enjoys cheep bears and vodka, also the most expensive cigarretes avaliable in local superemarkets. One i calculated how much money, he's wasting... well a lot. To put it into perspective, without giving any specific numbers (theese things everywhere cost different amounts), he smokes over 1 package of cigarettes a day, and also drinks enough beer that when i was younger the money from selling cans to the local junkyard was enough to satisfy my needs.   


I rememmber him as a ridicolously intelligent person, he worked hard, was sort of a workoholic. He's also a perfectionist. I loved him, he was still drinking when i was younger but not that much. I can quite confidentially say that he's has alcoholic genes. Eveyrone in his family drunk a lot. For example, his brother drunk himself to death and his other one, is on a good way to do so, his sister thoe is clean. Im sometimes scared that i will become an alcoholic like him too, especially because my future choice of job is crazy stressfull. Im always '' the sober one'' on parties.   


He's not really, aggresive. I mean he was, he once even hit my mother, and destroyed her plants with an axe but when we were away from home. Right now im big enough ( im taller and i weight more) that i can easly put him down. I once had to, i hit him really hard in the head. He fell over on the grass (it happened outside). Then the next day, he said that I failed him, becasue he never hit his father. I have to be honest i was kinda stunned when he said that. He was the aggresive one. He especially enjoys saying that my mother is ''the dumb one'' (that's the best way that i can translate it).   


He's also ill. He's pancreas is on the verge of shutting down but he doesn't stop. Also im 100% sure that he has lung cancer, the way he always caughs like he's close to puking almost, is so characteristic. My mother says that his father also coughed like that (he died of a lung cancer). At the same time, he gets mad when someone prepares something heavy or with a decent amount of fat in it, and says that he won't eat it becuase he's pancreas is in bad condition. When i was 12 we had to live in another house, because he was too aggresive to deal with. After that he stopped. Usually when he starts drinking he's totally drunk and stays like that for about a week. Then, the first day of ''soberness'' is always the worst for him, he's angry, and likes to point out everything to the point of dellusion, when he just starts making up things on the go.   


He also in 2002 got put in military jail for dirnking too much. Stayed in it for about 4 months. That was the momment when something snapped in him. He changed, of course he made quite a career, but he's drinking problem started to strengthen every day. He had been drinking since he was 15, but just more than average. Nothing too big, just that kind of a person everyone said. They were wrong.   


I feel sad for that poor idiot. I watched him, everyday he became more and more stupid. I sometimes like to joke that when he drinks if you be quiet enough you can hear he's grey cells dying. He's a shadow of former himslef. To give you an example how big of a drinker he is. Im 2 cm taller than him, and i weight more (around 80kg), and i wear S clothes. He's smaller and 6 kg lighter, but wears clothes XXL. He kinda looks like a skeleton with swollen liver.   


He also, has a sad story. He's father died when i was around 1 year old (2002 after the mission in Irac). He promised my mother that he won't do the same. He's on a good way to repeat his father mistakes. It is also hard for my mother. I support her as much as i can but she also snapped. There is something wrong with her mind, i won't go for the details i just want to let you know about it.   


To close this chaotic essay. I just feel sad for him. I want to help him, not because he's my father but becuase he was once a wonderful man, able to work really hard, wise, and brilliant. He refuses any treatment. He says that ''is it wrong that i want to drink from time to time?''. He just doesn't see the problem. Even after i came back from the asylum because i was really close to suicide i never even heard him talking about it. We can't just leave him. My mom stubbornly it's not possible. He's alone, everyone left him becuase he's sainter and smarter than Pope and Einstein combined (in is opponion).

So yesterday I was feeling average in the morning just really turned on. I was masturbating every 15 mins literally I was so turned on So I thought hmm this ain't normal? All day I couldn't eat nothing I tried to drink electrolyte drinks and water  . I even forced some mashed potato down because my mom had made chicken n mashed potato but my body wasn't having the chicken . So I was only able to eat the potato. Then around 7 pm I felt it my chest getting tight and kinda having a hard time breathing and started sweating . I felt it before but before I would just breath n lay down and it would go away . This time it was different it was TERRIBLE Everything that happen So around 10 pm I told my mom to come sleep with me because I was scared to sleep alone , kinda dumb for a 27 year old male to have to ask his mom that !.. so around 11 it kicked in hard core and stronger than ever ! I literally had like 2 seizures and my mom was screaming and terrified . And I was hallucinating so bad and hearing and even feeling things . Which to me sounds like delirium tremens I looked it up and i had all the symptoms. Like it got to a point where I couldn't tell what was real and what was not . When I was having that seizure attack thing while it was happening it was like I saw my mom next to me but her face was different and she was laying down then I saw hands coming from under her and they were grabbing me a lot of hands were coming from under her and grabbing me . And everything looked gray like if I were in another world like in silent Hill , nothing looked normal . I honestly at one point I tought I had died . Then I was able to snap out of that place and my mom was crying about to call 911 . So I told her not to (stupid I know ) but I said I can make it Tru da nite . Then after wards I just like was closing my eyes and I was back in that creepy place again I was like switching back n forth between that place and reality . Then I heard what sounded like my mom's voice but she was whispering in my ear things like you are so stupid and laughing I know for a fact that wasn't my mom . At this point I already knew for a fact I was also hearing things . Then I felt someone touching my neck and my ear and pinching it and it hurt . Everything was so realistic. I am TERRIFIED I feel that things continue like this I will go to the ER now. This morning after being able to sleep a little bit I woke up and still feel my body kinda numb from my rite side and kinda twitching still a little rite now . Still having a hard time eating but I managed to eat some eggs n ham . Now even more I wanna be sober but I'm afraid i can't do it , I tried so many times before and always fall back . But after what happened last nite which is the worse thing that has happened to me it scared me away this my first time all this happens  . I don't want to ever go thru that nightmare again and I really don't wish that on anybody ..",alcoholism,alcoholism
"Looking for ED related novels. I really enjoyed *Wintergirls* by Laurie Halse Anderson when I read it a few months back. I'm currently considering picking up *Second Star on the Right* by Deborah Hautzig. Are there any other recommendations? I have access to that google drive folder shared back in the /r/proed days with a bunch of PDFs - novels, diet / exercise books, etc. Not sure if I'm allowed to share it here.

In particular, I'm looking for something where the character actually gets forced into inpatient and has to deal with being essentially force-fed. Does such a novel even exist?

"Does this sound like Schizophrenia?  Hello Everyone,

Recently I did a psychological evaluation four days ago at one of the best hospitals in my city, where they said I do not have schizophrenia, and I am not showing any positive symptoms or negative symptoms. They also told me to lay off the caffeine, where I have around 2-3 cups of coffee a day. That day, I ended up having a grande coffee and I found myself another caffine craze where I was jittery and very nervous. I have been trying to decompress by having decafe, and it has been helping, though at times I am still nervous. I also had another ""too much caffeine"" episode one week before the 2nd one.

The past two days I have not been getting much sleep recently. On Friday, I slept from 12:30 PM to 5 AM, and I couldn't go to bed after that. Yesterday, I went to bed at like 1:45 AM, and woke up at 9 AM, but I did end up waking up in the night again. Today, I found myself really tired and very anxious. Over the course of my schizophrenia anxiety, I sometimes worry I am being watched. I realize that this was false, as I was just anxious and misattributing my anxiety to it. However today when I woke up that fear came again, and I tried calming myself down by telling myself, no one is watching me, things like clocks and monitors cannot watch me cause they are inanimate, but I still thought about it. So I do believe that I am not being watched by anything.

I went to the gym, worked out, had another decaf coffee (2nd one today) and I was really tired when I came back into my house. I was playing a game, Sniper Elite V4, when I thought my heard phone ringing when it really wasn't. I know it was a hallucination, and this had me really freaked out that could be psychosis. Just 40 minutes ago too, I took a nap cause I was tired, and during the nap (and this happens when I am very tired), I had a sleep paralysis hallucination where I felt I was going upside down, I couldn't move and it ended suddenly. The phone ringing thing has only happened once, and I remember I had it happen one time ago where I was really tired.

I am worried that hearing my phone ring without it really ringing is a sign I might be descending into Schizophrenia. I know it was only four days ago that two psychiatrists (one resident and one psychiatrist) cleared me. I have also seen 3 other mental health professionals (one psychiatrist and one psychologist) who said I do not have schizophrenia. From what you read, should i run to the hospital now to get antipsychotic medication. Is this a sign of schizophrenia or should i get some sleep? im really tired right now, body is aching and i am feeling sleepy.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Sharing Thoughts I had Rapid On-set Psychosis back in November of 2017. I would have severe psychotic episodes almost everyday for 2 and a half months. My delusions destroyed my relationship, my thought process even to this day, and ripped through my self esteem. Some people don't realize just how scarring this stuff is they think; oh, you recovered that's good now you're normal again and stuff. In all honesty though you never recover from mental scars this deep you can only move on, and try your best to rationalize thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

with that said I'd like to share some experiences I've had post brain injury.

I was sitting at a table at work with some guys I didn't know too well just chatting, when one of them for seemingly no reason said something about Paris. (we were talking about skiing so it was very out of place(theres no skiing in paris)) just the smallest thing but it kinda triggered some memories. I just had this overwhelming feeling to fucking run and just go, I was screaming internally. I struggled to make any response to him, he might have been thrown off at my darting glance towards him as he spoke the word Paris. I won't get into why Paris is a bit of a soft spot for me especially talk about going to Paris as it is very much TMI. But it is completely irrational and that's a fact.

I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, I am in touch with plenty of doctors however though I don't like to share much with them. I am sure I don't have PTSD aswell but I can get pretty close to the feeling of it I think. Much of what I feel however is impossible to explain as it is mostly deep in my mind. At times the feelings can be absuredly euphoric feelings, I can only describe as this looming gray.

Thought I'd share Thanks!",ptsd,ptsd
"I feel like I've lost the ability to connect with people I just went on this date with this beautiful woman, who I am incredibly attracted to, and I really like her personality and we have so much in common. At the end of the date, she asked if she could kiss me and I said yes, and I definitely felt some ""stuff"" during that kiss. But as I drove away I realized I don't feel any connection with her and it made me really sad. I feel like I've lost the ability to connect with people on a deep level, whether it's with my parents, new/current friends or romantic partners. Last year I slept around a lot because I didn't want to have to connect with people on a deeper level, it felt too scary to have to trust people. I just feel like this feeling is gone. I don't know if it's the medications I am taking or if it's just another shitty thing as a result of PTSD and being sexually assaulted.  ",ptsd,ptsd

"How do I ask a co-worker if they're on the spectrum? Hi everyone, about a month ago we had a new worker start with us (warehouse work) and since then I've noticed a few things that seem off, such as the rate at which they learn, the way they do things, among a few other things that stand out. 


As team leader of my area, I sat down for about half an hour today to have a chat with them about how they're going, mentioned a few areas of the work that need to be improved, among other things. I don't want to go into too much detail, but when looking at how they work as well as what was said during this chat, myself and my manager believe that they're on the spectrum.


We have absolutely no problem with this, but do understand that this can affect how they work and would just like to know if they're so we can alter the way we teach them to suit their needs. How should we approach said person and ask this question? I understand it can be a delicate subject to talk about, especially since they haven't said anything about it and maybe they didn't want to tell us?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Frequent eye floaters (things in the corner of my eye, especially recently)    

&amp;#x200B;

\-Eye flashes (especially when turning my head and stuff like that, but I think I've always had this)    

&amp;#x200B;

\-Questioning everything I see and hear and fearing it's a hallucination (turns out usually it isn't)    

&amp;#x200B;

\-Fear of delusions, and feeling uncomfortable when government or aliens are mentioned, because I researched     symptoms    

&amp;#x200B;

\-Sometimes, I won't take care of my hygiene so much and it will freak me out    

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hypnagogia and racing thoughts      


\-Constantly practicing conversations in my head (I can tell reality from thoughts though and can't stare off)    

&amp;#x200B;

\-Constantly checking for changes in my behavior and freaking out whenever I feel even slightly antisocial or forgetful    

&amp;#x200B;

\-Feeling detached and emotionally numb sometimes, but not always. I sometimes feel like I'm not myself, I don't know how to explain it the best way possible      


\-Sometimes feeling weird outside, and fearing I'll start believing that someone is out to get me or that is following me. For an example, I'm outside, all's good, then I start thinking about going crazy and I get a thought like ""could they be looking at me/following me right now?"" and I try to snap out of it, because I don't truly believe that, but it's like an obsessional idea. I'm scared of believing this.  


I am still functional, my grades are even getting better, I maintain conversations really well. I constantly seek for social interactions and time with friends and my girlfriend, just to not be alone with my thoughts.

"After clearing this with a mod, I'd like your thoughts on the matter : Autism = Evolution, A Speculation Post I'm figuring autistic is the term given to sensitives. The spectrum is just people taking in more than normal data.
There's a tipping point where it's overwhelming to their other operation tracks. There are only so many bits of data we can process at one time, and modern media has studied how to consume as much of that attention as possible. 
The thing is, there's so many of us humans that evolution can make a bunch of different, specific groups of sensitivities.
So some people are smart, some are slightly dull, some can barely control the blend of sensitivities they have. 

I think folks like us are in the middle of functional some ways, and on the razor's edge of too much. And since we feel like there's nothing that keeps that ""too much"" away, we must be broken. So we're don't deal with learning how to deal with it. How to own it and read it like it's part of us. We self-medicate to try and bliss or blend or blackout. We throw our shit in worse imbalance. 

I think some of the ways that we're sensitive, as people, are necessary for our evolution. I think understanding all of them is vital to it. 

I think it's.... We used to have these crazy threats all the time, we had to focus on cave people and tribal shit. Prevention and damage control-- prevent starvation, species death, territory loss. Try to keep the next generation arriving steadily and populated. 

The less we've had to work, the more we've turned our senses to the reality around us. We think more, perceive more in the form of information in our faces; we still have that threat assessment part built in. The prevent and preserve. 

So nothing but the reproductive drive and the ease of life as our go-to, how we've stayed alive. The amount of color, sound, emotional data, intellectual data, then all the expert programming from the media sources.... There's more than the brain is used to. It's passing on some of that burden on the basics part of the brain. This part of the brain was the part of the brain that stored all the shit we needed to deal with right away. The animal sounds and the prints in the jungle. The light and the water and the stuff we couldn't look at while hunting that antelope or whatever. It's the part of the brain that had to take on the extra senses we're developing, and we're developing them because that part of the brain is bored and because there's a shitload to keep up front as threats.

"My boyfriend is an alcoholic I’m in desperate need of advice. I’ve(29) been with my boyfriend (34) for almost 3 years. We have an amazing life together and are happy in almost every way. 

I’m really worried about his drinking. He’s struggled with addiction problems for a majority of his adult life which ruined his past relationship of 9 years. 

He was sober when I met him, which is where a lot of my attraction for him came from. Shortly after we started dating he picked up drinking again. I have struggled for the past 2 years to understand WHY he drinks so much. He’s a career bartender(and a mighty good one I might add) that works 5 nights a week at a family restaurant that closes at 9pm and he consistently does not get home until 1-2am.

I reached my boiling point about 5 months ago. For these past months I’ve explained to him multiple times how his drinking is effecting me and our relationship. I’m mostly worried about his drinking and driving. He WILL eventually hurt someone, himself, or get a DUI. All we do is get in screaming matches 3 nights a week. The only time we don’t is when I chose to ignore him or pretend to be asleep when he gets home. 

Last night he pulled up at 1am and hit the sidewall of our driveway hard enough to dent and crack his front bumper pretty bad. This is not the first time this has happened ( he hit my car last year), and I can’t help but to feel like next time it will be major. 

I don’t know what to do, I feel as though I’ve done everything I could to get my point across. I’ve been nice, mean, understanding, empathetic to his reasons, I’ve walked out at times and spent a couple days away from him. It seems to stop for a week or so but then picks up again. He will not go to meetings, but will admit he has a problem. 

I’m at a loss. Our sex life is struggling, my happiness is wavering. Our lease will be up in July and as of now I do not intend on resigning with him in this condition. My sanity is being pushed to its limit.

Well about a month ago i stopped eating any processed foods, sugars, or breads and I’ve never felt better mentally or physically. This weekend was the key factor. I decided to have a burger one day then pizza the next. Well guess what? I had my least constructive day at work in a long time. It hurts to breathe due to the inflammation, and i can’t focus on anything. Nothing is entertaining me. Lots of symptoms. 

This is a solution for sooooo many of you, i promise! Ya hard AF to find out what to eat. But just stick with chicken, steak, fish, rice, potatoes, mass amounts of veggies, and water. 

There’s more to eat than that. But not much lol. 

Want to feel better? Start right now. Throw out your food or give it away and you’ll feel better in under a month. And don’t cheat! This is your new life. Going out to eat? Get a burrito in a bowl instead of with tortilla. 

I’m telling u. U want change this month?! This is a big solution i promise. I even came off of meds it was working so well. ",adhd,adhd
"Seeking help for a friend who's son has eating issues... My best friend has a son who will be 5 in October. He was born 7 weeks premature and first many years she has assumed this was the cause for his delays. Even when her pediatrician told her ""your son seems to be autistic"" she felt that the pediatrician just didn't know her son and his full story. He didnt speak until he was 3 and even now it is difficult to understand him. He WILL NOT eat. Sometimes he will only eat one bite of food per day or skip days entirely. She has cried and panicked and bargained for years as her son just doesn't eat or gain weight. He has just been classified as failure to thrive at 31 lbs and hasn't gained any weight in the last 6 months. I had a talk with her the other day that she needed to have him evaluated and since the wait to have that done is up to a year, she needed to jump on it. She filled out the forms today. In the meantime, has anyone experienced this feeling issue to this extreme? Any advice what so ever? I know that if he is evaluated and determined to be autistic she will then have access to resources to help him but in the interim we need to find a way to help this poor little guy to eat.",autism,autism

"New post/first post here. (NSFW-potential trigger, warning) Delete this if it violates any rules. 

Lately I've been trying a new therapy on top of like everything else. It was sort of an indirect result of me solving another issue all together. 
I was 18 when I received an untreated sport injury (untreated as in ignored or mistreated for approximately 6 weeks), and it honestly left a deep deep scar on the tapestry of my life. I've given birth. I've had my son cut out of me minutes after my legs finally went numb. I don't think I've ever in my life experienced pain like that ever again. And yet, everyday things like walking and standing and basic human things are painful and sometimes debilitating.  

I finally met a therapist that believed I wasn't crazy or making up the things I finally said aloud for once. The things that keep me up at night. The things that replay over on a loop in the back of my mind throughout my day. 
Life has been full of remembrances today. 

This one was strange because it felt more of an 'ah-ha!' moment than dreadful or worrisome. I remembered something today that I had not thought about in years. But here goes eh. 

So when I was 15 I got braces put on. I was in foster care, officially from age 10 to 19. Unnofically I've been talking to and meeting with and being taken away by social workers for about 2/3s of my childhood [first time I spoke with a social worker I had just turned 6]. My mom was the first daughter in her family to not have to attend Residential School in Ontario, Canada. I won't say much about a story that isn't mine, just that our entire family is the result and product of generational trauma.
 So anyways, when I was 15 I had to have the least expensive option for my orthodontics.  Which translated to straightening, but not fixing, my genetically doomed teeth. So that meant that I had metal brackets and a thin piece of wire tensed in my mouth for however freaking long. My Foster Mom, who was my older siblings dad's first cousin (who also banged said first cousin), used go get very explosively angry. 

I honestly don't remember what the argument or fight was about or how it started. All I remember was being in the car on the way home and it getting silent. Which is always the worst. And then her fist was gnashing my cheek into metal. 
I think I finally figured out why she was never able to become a nurse. She was so incredibly squeamish around blood. Like nearly pass out within minutes squeamish with blood. She had a panic attack when she walked in on me in the middle of the night one time when I was oj my period. Anyways, I digress. I guess she had hit me much harder than she had anticipated. I had blood dripping down my chin and it didn't stop until we got home. My mouth was f'd up dude. I couldn't let it get infected and since I had an abscess on one of my teeth, I couldn't use salt (which I guess would make it worse because bacteria?), so I had to gargle with salt water for a solid two weeks until my mouth finally healed up. 
She got mad at me for having used her mouthwash and confronted me about it. But idk what tf that conversation turned out like. 

Anywho, that's one random PTSD memory I had today. I saw blood bu accident today. 👌",ptsd,ptsd

"Need help on how to approach boyfriend about his alcoholism I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this so feel free to tell me to take this down, but I originally wrote about this situation on the relationship advice sub and most, if not all the people that answered told me to leave him, which is not what I want to do at this time. 

My boyfriend who i’ve just recently moved in with has been drinking excessively (we’re talking a 12 pack a day during weekdays, even more on weekends)  and it’s starting to affect me. When he’s drunk, he is NOT the man I originally started dating. He’s moody, rude, and once pushed me on to the ground when I tried to get him off of someone’s property when he was stumbling home. When I brought this up a few months ago he was very apologetic and felt horrible, said that he’ll work on it but he does realize that he has a problem and even said that he shouldn’t be allowed to date anyone. I comforted him and said that I’ll stick by him no matter what, even through the bad times. 

However, recently I’ve tried to bring this up again and he immediately shut me down saying I should’ve known better than to get attached to “an alcoholic piece of shit”, which honestly broke my heart when I heard this. I’m getting really worried about him. He’s losing a LOT of weight and I’m not sure if it’s because his job (restoration stone mason) is physically demanding or there’s something actually wrong with him.

"So... how do you know if it’s a problem? Hey guys,

This is my first time visiting this subreddit and I’m guessing you guys might get this question pretty often. So, I’m a 26 year old male and I had my first sip of alcohol when I was 16. I still didn’t really drink until my college days (18 or 19). I drank pretty heavy on the weekends (every weekend) but it was college so it felt completely normal to me. I graduated when I was 22 and I now have the typical 9-5 with a wife and a 2 year old daughter. These past 4 years since I graduated, I never stopped drinking but the way I drink has definitely changed. I’m not getting hammered on the weekends but I’ll end my night with 3-5 drinks probably 4-6 nights a week. A few times a month I’ll get “pretty drunk”, but nothing like I used to. 

I guess it’s just kind of a fuzzy line between being an alcoholic and just enjoying alcohol. When I think of alcoholics I think about people who drink all day or who cant stop once they start. I also don’t think I drink to escape anything, but I do have minor problems just like anyone else, so maybe? Either way, I still feel I drink more than the average person. I can honestly say I don’t think I’ve gone more than 2 full weeks without a drink since I was in college, and that sounds bad. Its not like I’ve tried to quit and couldn’t, I just never tried to stop (I’m not sure which one is worse lol) So I guess I’d just like to hear you guys’ opinion on this and whether or not you think I should try to cut back or either drop it completely ",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Chronically bored and depressed. I was diagnosed at a fairly young age with ADHD. I was on medication for it for a few years, and for whatever reason, my parents decided to stop the treatment. Not exactly sure on why, but I think my dad just wasn't sold on ADHD being a real thing (this was the 90's) and didn't like the idea of me being ""doped up"" all the time. Throughout most of my teenage years, I subscribed to the same belief, that ADHD was not real, I interpreted it as merely a personality trait some people have. I believed this despite the mountains of medical professionals who studied it, and struggling with the symptoms every day without even realizing it.

I was, and am always bored. Like always. Even when I'm doing something I enjoy, such as playing games or listening to music, I still don't always break this feeling. I thought this was normal. I thought this was something everyone felt and I was just managing it wrong. I was baffled by friends and classmates that could just sit there and simply do an activity. That is not and has never been how I operate. To combat this boredom, I constantly seek stimulus such as music, games, socializing, and anything else I could do to simply kill time, often multiple activities at the same time (the music almost never stops in my room, silence is almost painful to me.) 

I thought I was just good at multitasking, but it was just a coping mechanism. Of course, this issue of chronic boredom makes it incredibly hard to focus on anything that doesn't spark my interest at least a little. So yea, all classic ADHD symptoms right?

I'm now in my 20's and have been actively trying to get treatment for my ADHD. In the years since I stopped medication, my symptoms went untreated, causing a whole host of other  problems. By my senior year in high school, I developed a mild case of depression and anxiety, also common in people with ADD. Still not acknowledging ADD, I sought treatment for these conditions, but nothing worked as my root issue was not being addressed. I barely finished high school (had to take summer classes my last year to graduate), and have had trouble holding down any type of job. On top of the challenges that come with inattentiveness and forgetfulness in the workplace, I often was either bored or anxious 90% of the time. This would inevitably lead to me quitting or just outright not returning to a job after a few weeks or months, depending on how long I could stick it out. It's not that I'm not willing to work, I just find myself extremely unhappy with every job I've had, even the ""easy"" ones. Especially the ""easy"" ones.

Not really sure why I'm posting this, I guess the boredom is as play here. Like I said earlier, I'm seeking treatment, but I have no insurance, no job, and no money, so I'm relying on family to help me with this, which I hate doing. I'm currently prescribed 20mg Adderall XR once a day, but I've noticed no difference from my normal state so far. Against my better judgement and out of frustration, one day I took 2, just to see if I noticed anything. So far, the only effect I've noticed at all is decreased appetite, which is good in my case as I am overweight, but not the effect I was looking for. 

Besides ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety medication, the only other drugs I've ever taken are common over the counter meds, alcohol, and canabis. Cannabis does wonders for all my symptoms accept the inattentiveness depending on how much I smoke, which isn't surprising once I found out more about ADD and the way in which medications are used to treat it. Cannabis seems to take care of all the dopamine related issues with ADD, to a point. I actually have increased mental clarity, focus, and just generally feel better on a light dose, though it's very temporary and the effect wanes with tolerance of course. I honestly would just stick to this if it weren't for the stigma around the substance and the fact that most employers, at least where I live, drug-test and will not hire anyone with cannabis in their system, also it's rather expensive the rate at which I consume it and not to mention hard to actually obtain depending on where you live.  I'm not looking to get into a debate about cannabis use, just know that I only use it because my ADD symptoms went untreated, and I self-medicated the only way I could find, although at first it was to ease anxiety, which it also does. Once I realized WHY I was self-medicating, that's when I made the decision to try and get ""properly"" medicated.

So far, my Adderall seems to do nothing at all, even after doubling my current dose. I was on Ritalin when first diagnosed, I don't know if that's a factor or not, but maybe my brain just responds better to that. Not sure what's going on here, even in severe cases of ADD, most people seem to report feeling SOMETHING from adderall starting at around 40mg. I've read that going higher than that typically provides no more beneficial effects, so I don't know if increasing my dosage would be healthy, or even help if it was. I don't want to ask my doctor to increase doses or suggest medications and the like because that's seen as suspect behavior of people simply seeking the drugs, I just want to find a treatment that actually works for me.

I'm at the end of my rope here. I have pretty severe case of anxiety and mild depression rooting from ADHD related issues. I'm trying to get help, but every roadblock feels like a mountain to me. I feel like I have so much potential but it's trapped in my fucked up brain. Before the depression set in, I used to play and make music, write poetry and just was generally very creative. Now I rarely feel that. I haven't composed new music in years, and I have no real desire or motivation to. Last time I tried I couldn't even make anything that I felt like was even half-decent. All those things I used to do to keep my self stimulated don't do it anymore. On some days, it's not as bad, but mostly, I feel like I'm rotting away.

"New Here! Have a question :) Hey all! Just found this Subreddit today. My finance suffers from suspected PTSD due to childhood sexual abuse along with some other diagnosed mental illnesses (Narcissistic Personality Disorder, OCD, Bipolar Disorder, and one diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder but we’re not as sure about that one), and I had a question regarding his behavior I’m hoping someone might be able to help shed some light on. I’ve been especially concerned lately because there are some days where he seems like a completely different person. Some days he’s relatively cheerful and alert and seems normal and we have normal conversations. But some days he is so out of it that he can barely walk or stand without assistance. His speech can get slurred, he can sometimes fall, his driving skills suffer greatly. It’s like he’s heavily intoxicated, even though I know he couldn’t possibly be. Worst of all, he seems to have no idea he’s even like that. Whenever I ask him if he’s okay he just tells me he’s tired, and when I try to explain how he’s acting he has no idea what I’m talking about. It’s very scary for me and I don’t know what I can do to help other than keep him from falling and be comforting and get him to bed when necessary. I can’t discern any specific causes other than sometimes these days correlate to when he is tired or upset, but not always. Another note is that on the days where he is like this he seems more likely to wet the bed at night, which happens from time to time.

"Fluid Retention After Surgery? I was curious to see if anyone would have any information about this.

I got some teeth removed and a bone graft procedure yesterday morning. This morning, the scale says I'm about 2-3 pounds heavier than I was before surgery? Of course, I have been eating even less than usual since I'm on a mostly liquid diet now. 

Am I right in thinking it's probably just water weight? Definitely need some reassurance rn lol.

-Some fucktards debating a poor, sane soul, on whether a (clearly underweight) model was underweight or not. Said fucktards estimate her BMI to be around 19. Lmfao, you fucktards, my BMI is 18.6 and I look like an absolute lard ass. Anyone smaller than me is CLEARLY underweight, yet who am I to say, I’m just a fat fuck in denial I guess. 

It pisses me off that these people claim to be the champions of health and fitness, and created a whole sub with the premise of shitting on fat people under the pretense of health, yet these precious underweight women that they white knight for are #Valid and #Queens and of course, never unhealthy. 


It also pisses me off that people go around this world thinking they’re #woke saying shit like “people are getting so fat that our society has a warped view on what a normal weight is hurr durr my BMI is 25 and people are always telling me to eat a burger teehee” then turn around  and say that they think all models are normal weight.

"Concern for Carly Fleischmann TW: sexual assault 

Friends, I need your help. A young woman named Carly Fleischmann needs your help. 

If you can, please read and share with anyone you think might be able to help.

As many of you know, Carly is a young woman with nonverbal autism. For most of her life, her means of communication were very limited. When she was given the opportunity to type on a keyboard, for the first time we heard her inner voice, and what a beautiful voice it is! 

Carly has been active on social media and has gained a significant following of supporters. She has interviewed such celebrity icons as Channing Tatum, Whitney Cummings, Grace Helbig, James Van Der Beek, and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and it has been a pleasure to watch her pursue her dreams of becoming a talk show host.

In January of this year, after a period of absence, Carly returned to social media with a disturbing message. In short, Carly describes how her father’s (Arthur Fleischmann) boyfriend sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions. When Carly approached her father with this information, he dismissed her claims of abuse and defended his boyfriend’s actions. 

Needless to say, Carly’s supporters were shocked and enraged upon reading this information. Shortly after it was published, Carly’s post was removed. An “administrator” then posted on Carly’s Facebook and Twitter accounts stating that her social media accounts had been “hacked”, and the family later claimed that post was made by a “disgruntled former employee”. 

Now, it has been nearly 6 months since we’ve heard from Carly. We have no idea of her whereabouts, and her last known location was likely with a family member in Toronto, possibly her mother, her brother, or her father and his predatory partner, most of if not all of who have denied or ignored Carly’s story.

Carly’s autism and oral apraxia make it necessary for her to rely on other people to get by, and so far, those people have let her down. All attempts to reach out to her family members are shut down, ignored, or blocked. Carly’s voice has been taken away, and her safety and well-being is in question.

PLEASE SHARE with anyone you think might ne able to help to raise awareness for Carly and demand that the man that abused her be held accountable for his actions and that Carly's safety be confirmed. Don't let her story be erased.",autism,autism

"ED making my life SO unexpected... It's almost as if every year I have a whole new problem to deal with. 
I'm about to start my senior year. Aside from my relatively new ED, this year was already full of other mental health issues I've struggled with (depression, attempted suicide, subsequent hospitalization, losing a therapist, more anxiety). This summer my ED has thrown my life all out of wack. After months of restrictive eating, excessive exercise, losing my period, etc, my first appointment at an ED clinic came up. Surprise, surprise: my heart rate and blood pressure was dangerously low and I needed to be hospitalized yet again. It's safe to say I wasn't happy. After being discharged, I began outpatient where they took away all control over food from me and gave it to my parents. I finally got diagnosed with atypical anorexia. Worst of all, I'm not allowed to work out - the only thing that helps me cope with the anxiety and depression. Heading into my last year of high school with all these new rules and limits (when I'm supposed to be experiencing the most freedom), it's disappointing to say the least. Not to mention the guilt of having to make my parents take a break from work so they can supervise my every meal...

"The Secret Confessions of an Alcoholic on the Edge So I have been wanting to write about confessing my feelings for a long time. I don't know if this will help me in anyway, do me harm or nothing at all but I wanted to get it out there. Maybe it will help someone out there who knows. There is so much spilling out of me this may seem all over the place. 

&amp;#x200B;

For over 8 years I have been an alchoholic. It took me a long time to admit it. I love alcohol and hate it at the same time. I have been to rehab, and given it up more times then I can count only to have it re-enter my life. I'm drawn to it but also go out of my way to avoid it. I lock myself away from the world because of my fear and what I become when I drink. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean it is around every corner out there, and every corner in my mind. There is nowhere to hide. My family keeps a close eye on me because of my past so its like a prision but I feel like I deserve it too for my past mis deeds. Torn between,  I have existed in a weird paradoxical purgtory. When I don't drink, I feel like I'm not really here, I don't enjoy much and life seems pointless. I think about drink from time to time, more frequently lately but i mostly feel like im floating through life. When I do drink, I feel happy for about 10 minutes before I drink too much and forget what happens. All that is left when I come to is pain, shame and the hurt that I have caused those I care about.  

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't drank in two months now, I go month periods without drinking, But I feel misrable. At first I feel great and after the illness wears away from the excess I'm at my peak. But over time i whittle away back to where I am now.  I'm reaching my usual cycle where I reset with drinking. I don't want to and try to stay strong but its hard and everyday gets more bleak. 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss interaction, I used to have friends. I used to have a girlfriend. Since I locked myself up I haven't seen any of them. I'm scared to go out there. They want to go to pubs and bars. Places which are danger zones for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss sex.  God... that one is an itch I wish I didn't have. I get anrgy at being horny and get horny every few days. I wish I never had experienced how great sex can feel.  I think how long its been since i had sex. I can't even remember.  Maybe two years now, who knows. Your guess is now as good as mine. How sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

When was the last time I went on a date? I laugh in my head but it ain't funny. I think about seeing a prostitue. I have done so in the past and it was nice to just feel something. Even a good cuddle with a woman would be more than enough right now. But who am I kidding. I miss sex bad. I hate porn and masturbation. I want to feel close to someone. I just want to feel.  I used to think drink made me horny and wanting sex but when the drink left the feeling is still there, I hate it. Why can't we have a damn off switch for sexual desire. I would shut that thing down in a heartbeat.

&amp;#x200B;

I could try go out, clear out my system. Do all the things I know is wrong but people will ask ""where are you going? what are you doing"". I can't tell them the truth. They want to keep me locked up anyway or follow me everywhere. ""Can I go with you?"" F No!

I know it is with good intentions but it drives me crazy.  I want to cry but I'm trapped and there is no escape for me. Do i want to escape? Or is it better I'm trapped here, safe but misrable. What a miserable state of affiars with no light at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I guess if you made it this far, learn from me. If you have any of the things I don't, appreciate them. If you have a girlfriend, a lover, a friend.. love them like no one else could. Alchohol has taken one of the most important things I ever had in my life, my freedom... and in turn happiness.

"Got off adderall for the first time in a year, Feel like shit. This post is mostly to share about my experience and a odd way to help me articulate my brain right way. 

So to start off i was on 40mg of adderall a day, and there is a noticable diffrence in being able to multitask, listen, and basicly made me a super human at times. However i could tell it was a demodivator, the die off period was always tearable, and got depressed once a month like a period.

For those reasons I stoped about a week ago. And iv felt the weirdest mood swings since getting off, such as being the most depressed iv ever been, to happy, to anxious, to feeling rejected, all in the span of hour(also doesn’t help that I had the biggest family fight the day after getting off adderall). It has died down a lot  and can tell I’m still alittle depressed.

I now feel much more sluggish, not able to focus, and frustrated with this. However I can tell that I’m more creative, and (once the weir off stops) more motivated and less mood swings. 

It’s odd after being on adderall for so long I forgot what it was like to be off it, and be my normal self. I imagine things will get better in the next month but just haft to get through it.

(Sorry for this being so long) 
my hopes for getting off adderall was to be happier,but at the cost of being worse at everything again.

I'm a longtime lurker/first time poster, but reading all the posts in this sub always brought a lot of comfort and occasional laughs (especially due to how relatable some of the situations are). Also, sorry for the clickbaity title. (I didn't want to make it too long…)

That said, as the title suggests, I had a revelation that kind of came out of nowhere, and I can't believe I just realized this now.

In the last two weeks, I kept expressing my frustration about how I find it really frustrating that I'm unable to get through anything without getting distracted. Twenty minute episode? Takes me AT LEAST double the time. Writing in my journal? Takes at least an hour. Readings for school? Dare I even get into that…

My therapist then just commented and said, ""So?"" (Cue my somewhat offended look when they first said that.) But then they went on to say that it doesn't matter that it takes longer than ""normal"". What matters is that I finish(ed). I shouldn't get frustrated about constant distractions, starting new tasks in-between, etc. They just said to keep going until I finish a task.

It's probably one of the most encouraging things and positive takes on my terrible focus that I ever heard. Now it's a matter of internalizing it…

But yeah, I wanted to share that. Maybe as a gentle reminder or suggestion to everyone here.

"Thinness doesn’t determine your disorder. This is a rant, PSA, story, and everything in one. It’s gonna be a long one. 


Throughout my disorder I’ve always been overweight. It started out binge eating, I had gained weight from antidepressants and my mother tried to force me on diets. She would restrict my food intake and it just made everything worse. I would horde food and money and use it to buy more food at school. I remember my mom used to let me have 2 eggo waffles each morning. So I would make 4, quickly shove 2 in my mouth and chew as fast as I could so she didn’t catch me. 

I always had the stupid stereotypical thoughts about how I want to lose weight, “might as well just be anorexic.” It was so stupid of me to ever think that would work out. No matter how little I ate, I always binged and the scale went up. When that number went up, it’s like it correlated with my self hatred. I thought losing weight would help me love myself.

That was absolute bullshit. I’ve struggled so much the last 6 years with absolutely nothing to show except for internal damage, and how the memories haunt me of my organs failing. I remember overdosing on diet pills and vyvanse in the school bathroom. They couldn’t even get an IV in me because my pulse was so strong, blood pressure 210/160. I remember having to consume 800mg of caffeine just to function and exercise, but never getting warm enough to stop my nails from turning blue. I remember going to the hospital because my kidneys were failing. What little urine I made was brown and smelled like burnt rubber. All because I couldn’t stop taking laxatives. 

And I have nothing to show for that. No “beautiful” physique like people think. No weight loss. No better mindset. Just more self hatred, scars, and the loss of normal bodily functions. But I have to tell myself that thinness does not determine my disorder. I’m not less sick because I’m fat. I can’t keep brushing off my habits and saying that I don’t have a problem. I do. I need to get that into my head to be able to change my feelings.

For everyone out there who is feeling alone, or unworthy, or struggling with the same thing I am. You are worth it. Your disease does not define you. And your weight does not determine how serious your disorder is. You can’t just put something on the back burner because you feel like it’s not important. It is, and you are important too.

A little bit about me: 29 male, I was never diagnosed as a child, but I grew up in a very religious home that believed any sort of behavioral issue was clearly **THE DEVIL**. 

started looking into adult ADD/ADHD a couple of years ago and felt like the symptoms really described what I was dealing with. And I don’t mean common symptoms - mean very precise, descriptive symptoms that beforehand, I couldn’t even find the words to describe.

I tell him how I feel very overwhelmed, I have a hard time getting organized, I constantly try to juggle multiple projects at work, I tend to be impulsive and indecisive simultaneously, I have such a hard time focusing, how easily i get frustrated with myself over small things, how no matter how hard I try I never seem to have the willpower to reach my goals, how my self-esteem has been affected by these things, etc.

Now through out my life ( I'm 26 now) I have been diagnosed with multiple things; ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depression and Dyscalculia to boot. I have been going to therapist pretty consistently lately and we have been doing EMDR which she suggested because I disclosed some traumatic events to her. More and more as my depression lifted I began to notice that I would have these period of contentedness and stability I had not had for a long time but there would be certain situations that just sent me for tail spin. I would think to my self ""Goddamn it, my depression just relapsed"", but  really all along I was being triggered..... My mind is blown. So much of the past 10 years of my life make sense. Why I just cannot talk about certain topics with out bursting into tears and wanting to run away, why when my Father, the person who in incited the trauma, I was so sweaty, why I barley graduated high school because I was to anxious to go home, abusing drugs and alcohol, feeling like I can never be close of trust any one because it will only lead to hurt. For the first time in my life I feel my diagnosis is correct, with EMDR I am actually seeing the most improvement I ever have. There has been so much pain and there is so much more work to do but I feel hopeful. Thanks for listening. Much love -A",ptsd,ptsd
"hppd? schizophrenia? pleasee help hi, i posted in this community a while ago, i was really panicked and basically spilled my whole life story when i wrote it. its really long but to ""summarize"", i was severely depressed and anxious my whole life, i tried to kill myself and it didn't go well, i came out of it feeling completely different, after this happened i did copious amounts of awful shitty  drugs like dxm and vicodin and other things i dont want to mention but i tapered off them and was clean for 2 years (i didn't mention the 2 years in my last post)  this summer i ate an edible and it was a really shitty experience (this is important) about a month after that experience i had to take a blood test because i was sick and i passed out during the test, which is normal for people, but the next day i was taking a bath and i felt the way i did during the test, like i was about to pass out, my vision going all blurry and dark, and i freaked out. the next three months after that consisted of me constantly having like, weed visuals like colors and the same awful anxious feeling in my chest, i'd get dxm visuals like geometry in my eyes and i couldnt sleep and was convinced i was going to die every time i drifted off. if i closed my eyes too long the blackness would slowly change colors and get whiter and whiter and it would be accompanied with that same drifting feeling and it literally would keep me jolting awake for hours. it felt like i was tripping everyday and i was 100% convinced that whenever the visuals got worse, if i didn't stop moving i would die, i would come home from class and end up walking miles past my house because i would be so scared that if i didn't stop walking i would literally fucking die. and im scared still. i feel like i've gotten used to the feelings but things are escalating again and im so fuckinv scared all the time im scared all the fucking time and things are getting worse again i see different things now the geometry in my eyes start to become like animal shapes when i stare at them for too long and i have to force myself to look away so that they dont fully form, im scared if i let them form then itlll take up my vision and ill die. I started off typing this somewhat calm but typing it all out is fucking making me so goddamn anxious and i just want to know what this is i did so much research and a couple days ago i found out theres this phenomenon called hallucinogen persisting perception disorder and that was very inline for what i was feeling and seeing about a month ago but now things are different, i dont feel real, i get extremely paranoid doing anything i cant go outside i cant do anything without thinking im going to die and it isn't totally because of the visuals anymore. im scared to drink the tap water in my house because im afraid its been laced i cant go out to eat im afraid the foods laced i cantdo FUCKING ANYTHING ANYMORE I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS AND EVERYONE KEEPS TELLING ME ITS SOMETHING I KNOW IT ISNT i just want a fucking answer just an explanation please. please. and to everyone who responded to that last post thank you but the situation is different now and i need someone to tell me what the fuck is going on in my brain ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"36 months waiting list for referral appointment... alternatives? Hey all. I’ve recently been referred for a diagnosis by my GP, I wasn’t diagnosed or referred as a child, and it only clicked in my mind after watching a documentary recently. But I just received the letter today telling me the waiting list is approximately 36 months. 

I’m feeling at a bit of a loss what to do to try and help myself in the meantime. I’ve googled local support groups but they all seem to be for parents of children with autism. Most online advice seems to be geared towards children too. I’m not sure whether I can avail of any organised support without an official diagnosis so I’m just not sure where to begin. 

Really I just need some advice about strategies for managing my day-to-day more than anything. I really struggle with relationships and social settings and I find it very hard to maintain employment too. I’m currently looking for another job, but feel like I’m drowning with the prospect of repeating the same cycles again and again, in work and in life, until I get some assistance. 

Is this something worth going private for rather than waiting? Or is there anywhere I can go for support without having the official diagnosis?",autism,autism
"Sex drive went down after I quit drinking For the last 10 years, almost every week, I had at least a night of binge drinking.

2 months ago I quit drinking for good, and I realized I lost at least 70% of my *normal* sexual drive.

I red that it should be the opposite, so I am kind of puzzled and I wonder if it’s just a coincidence.

Did this happen to anyone else? I’m a 35 yo male.

I overall feel way better: before I was putting way too much effort in achieving sex and even when I got it, my satisfaction would not last long. I was putting myself in risky situation to have sex and I was spending way too much money.

"I can't remember anything anymore and it's really stressing me out. Any tips from anyone that isn't currently on medications? Replies much appreciated. Let me just start out by saying I don't know if I actually have ADHD. I was diagnosed as a child. My parents took me off medication and said I didn't really have it and it was just my teacher with little patience.

I'm a computer science major so it's very important I remember formulas and solutions. Ever since I was taken off my medication I remember just fine. Even in college I only needed to take the normal amount of time. But now I'm struggling to repeat what I read without looking at it. Can it be my ADHD is getting worse? I can't remember anything I studied for my midterms.Are there any tips you guys have to help with this issue? I know I need to check again with a doctor but I have midterms too soon to be able to do all that by that time.

TL;DR Everything goes in one ear and out the other and in my eyes to the void. Any tips and tricks to help with that? Midterms are in five days can't go to doctor.

EDIT: Anyone that has medications can give tips too lol I primarily asked for people who don't because they I might be in the same situation.",adhd,adhd
"My Issues  Ok, so here goes nothing. I am going to try to explain my mental health  issue, and then try to get opinions from you guys if possible please. I  am 21 years old, and am not sure what my condition is yet, since I have  only been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety, but  there is more, but I have been told it could be some type of bipolar or  schizophrenia by psychiatrists and other mental health practitioners.  Ok, so I use to be a Christian by faith, and  my issue started, when one  day, I asked myself if it was fair that God was all mighty and  powerful, and that we would always be under his ruling. I felt that it  was not, so then I surely thought I was going to hell. I felt evil, and I  tried really hard to just accept that God just was always going to be  all powerful, with authority over everyone, and that no one could ever  be as strong as him, and I just felt that this was not right. I could  just not accept that in my heart, even though I tried. I tried praying  to God and telling ""him"" that if he wanted he could just somehow change  my mind and make me believe/understand that such concept was the right  thing. I also tried praying and told him to just straight up take my  life to end my suffering because I felt evil thinking like that. Reason  why I felt evil also, was because according to the bible, the devil  became the devil because he tried to be as mighty as God. I actually  conceptually and philosophically did see how trying to overthrow someone  is wrong, but to try to be as mighty as someone without hurting, was  not wrong. So yea, I felt really evil. For obvious reasons, I am no  longer religious, plus I always had my doubts about religion. Anyways,  then I started thinking about old-time/ancient hierarchies. How kings  and queens used to be more powerful than anyone, and had authority over  everyone, and also had authority over their grown children. So, in a way  I felt trapped because I translated that into how my parents would  always in a sense be ""greater"" than me, with authority over me, no  matter what I did. Don't get my wrong, I love my parents, but such ideas  in my head lead me to just feel like I was in a hell, thinking about  how it just felt unfair that just because they are my parents, even if  they don't have authority over me per say, they are somehow ""greater""  than me because they created me, and because of that, I would always be  under their dominion. So that's what I a currently fighting. I thought  about the=is everyday for probably 2 years now, so even though sometimes  I might begin to think that my parents do not have that type of  dominion over me, I somehow deep down in my head think that they do. I  guess I thought about this so much, that it got stuck in my head. It's  horrible and to be honest did ruin my life. I had never really had  anything like this happen to me. I get anxiety attacks, and went through  some, really, really dark times because of this. An opinion I would  like from you guys since you guys might be more clear on this topic  since you guys haven't had your brains fried by this exact idea is, what  is your guy's opinion on that parent-to-adult-child dominion thing. Are  parents just always going to be greater beings than heir children  because they made their children? I even feel evil for feeling that such  is not fair, so I get even more anxious. I know the idea might sound  ridiculous to some of you, and I somehow do understand how others could  view it that way, but it is very, very serious to me. I just want honest  opinions though, please don't lie to me of your opinions just to try to  ""help"" me. Thanks, I really would appreciate those opinions.

"Look who's planning (way) in advance, for once! (Questions about being a functional human without meds) Hello all! I'm (23F) recently married, and while we aren't planning on having kids right now, it is part of our plan. I've been taking medications (Vyvanse and Focalin, now Concerta and Ritalin) nearly every single day since I was 16. Out of curiosity, I was researching ADD meds and pregnancy, and while there were varying answers, most of the research ranged from ""dangerous"" to ""not recommended,"" so if possible, I'd like to avoid taking medication while pregnant and breastfeeding. (Of course, when I do eventually get pregnant, I'll speak to a doctor!)  
  
I'm concerned (and my husband has expressed concern) about who I'll become when I'm not on meds. On the few days when I don't take anything, I stay in bed all day, I don't take out the dog, and I eat like a pig. I *hate* myself like that, and I can't imagine *being* that for 9 months + breastfeeding.  
  
I was mostly wondering if you guys had any tips for something I could start doing now to make that transition easier. Like if there's some sort of ADD-friendly structure I could start implementing into my life now so that when I do eventually get off meds, I don't find myself becoming an unlovable blob. ",adhd,adhd

"Can anyone relate to this? Trigger warning (it's triggering to me so I don't know if it will be for others too)

A couple years ago my boyfriend and I decided to move states because he needed knee surgery (nothing too serious) and we were having financial problems. He ended up moving before me and I followed a few months later. He had the surgery while we were long distance in different states. Being apart from him  during such a hard time in our relationship and with him having surgery and recovering was really stressful for me. Now we are married  and doing well, but I keep having flashbacks to his surgery and panic attacks because my body is reliving it.  It sounds like the dumbest thing, but I can't even talk to him about his surgery because I have such bad anxiety surrounding it. He knows about this, and he knows to not talk about anything regarding surgery, hospitals, anesthesia, etc. I avoid all conversations, videos, etc about this topic because I can't stop thinking about that time two years ago and how helpless I was and I couldn't be there for him. I can't even handle him being sick or going to the dentist or even talking about these things because it brings up such bad memories for me. 

I have a history of depression, anxiety, and  OCD and now I think PTSD might be added to the mix.

"Wellbutrin XL 150/300 mg insomnia and other side effects HELP!! My doctor prescribed me 300 Wellbutrin xl per day for ADD and depression. I’ve been taking it for almost 2 weeks now I think (I’m in college btw). I started with 150 mg each day and nothing too major occurred except I felt sort of stoned like all the time. My concentration improved a little bit maybe but I still had trouble paying attention and had cravings for foods.. also my sleep schedule was not affected and I got tired at the end of the day. 

This Wednesday (so 2 days ago) I decided to take 300 mg like my doctor told me to so I took 150 mg in the morning like usual and another 150 mg after lunch. The effects were so much stronger than when I just took 150 mg a day(still felt stoned tho). That afternoon, I wrote an entire essay and paid attention during a very long lecture without losing focus and did more productive stuff that night. When I got back home at around 11 PM I was pretty tired from the day and got sleepy. I went to bed and Wellbutrin has caused me to not sleep so much but I still got like 6-7 hours. When I woke up I felt like I was still feeling the effects from yesterday so I just took 150 mg. And I think yesterday was the most productive I’ve been all semester. I stayed up until 4 am working (I wasn’t tired at all, usually I get tired at around 1-2 am) and I had trouble falling asleep. I stopped feeling stoned tho. I took3 mg melatonin and fell asleep at like 5-6 am but then now I’m awake at 8 am so I only slept 3 hours max and I feel soooo awake and focused. I’m feeling less stoned but I don’t want this insomnia to continue. I am thinking of only taking 150 mg today bc I’m afraid 300 mg will worsen my insomnia?? 

Other side effects I’ve experienced:
- I’m always hot. I’ve also sweat a lot and before i rarely sweated when I wasn’t active.
- after taking the 300 mg appetite suppression kicked in (I used to have a huge appetite)
- last night and this morning I have been feeling sort of nauseous 
- shaky hands 
- dry mouth, always thirsty 
- increased heart rate
- lost 7? Lbs in 2 weeks 
- less impulsive and can resist urges like checking my phone all the time (in fact I’ve had to force myself to check my phone to not miss anything important)
- the good thing is my depression has gotten better and I feel a lot less depressed, especially yesterday and today 

TLDR: My concern is, I’m really liking the concentration and boost in mood this drug is giving me and I think it’s being reflected in my grades and performance in school even in just these past few days. However since taking the 300 mg two days ago I’ve felt alert and turned on (idk how to describe it) all the time and I’m not tired at all even though I got 2/3 hours of sleep last night. How long will it take the insomnia to subside?? And should I just take 150 mg everyday now since the effects of 300 mg were so severe?? ",adhd,adhd
"Kinda Sick of People Pushing Diets to Treat Acne Sure, if someone's obese, then maybe losing weight will help their skin.

I didn't come here for help, I came here to give a voice to people like me. 

I've posted on this sub quite a few times, under different names, and all of my most honest posts -depressing as they may be- are always the most upvoted. Well, I've made a few joke posts about to do lists that were recieved very well, but overall I think my most honest, inner voice posts are the most well received. I especially like the two word comments like, 'me too' or the three word comments like ""yeah that's me,' because I feel you reading my posts, and having nothing more to say, because nothing more is needed.  

I love you strangers with ADHD like me. Especially the losers. Especially the ones who are still lost, still suffering in every moment. 

I promise you I won't give up. You shouldn't give up either, because the good bits, as tiny as they may be, are worth it, I think.  

Keep fighting, because even that little moment when you really like a song makes it worth it. So at least keep going until the next song, and the next, and the next, and so on, an so fourth.

"Need advice on eating disorder To start, I am 19 years old and a freshman in college. Growing up as an overweight--even obese at one point-- child, I came to have pretty bad body image issues by 6th grade. In eighth grade, I had shed most of my baby fat and was still bigger than other girls in my grade at around 130 lbs and 5'5 but healthy nonetheless. I can't pinpoint the exact time this took place, and I'm sorry if this is TMI, but I could not regularly go to the bathroom and when I did it would be small or once every few days. I get bloated very easily as well. I researched different ways to mend this and nothing ever worked. Keep this in mind.

By the summer before freshman year, I absolutely hated myself. I began to binge and purge regularly. This continued into my sophomore year but I began to gain even more weight as I'd stress eat all the time and got up to 150lbs and I lost my ability to be able to make myself throw up as my gag reflex did not work anymore. Towards the middle of 10th grade, I began to take laxatives until I started taking Hydroxycut hardcore elite (a diet pill with caffeine among other things) in excessive doses. At one point I was taking 6 at once (3x the recommended maximum dose) and almost called 911 on myself thinking I was having a heart attack. Then, I picked up coffee and cigarettes. I'd drink my coffee and have a couple cigarettes every morning which would help me to go to the bathroom and make me feel less bloated. As the middle of junior year rolled around, I picked up vaping instead thinking it would be healthier. I began to repeat my same ritual every morning and smoking my Juul throughout the day constantly as well. This seemed to temporarily solve all my problems: I could use the bathroom and I lost a ton of weight. I went from 130lbs (which I already saw as an improvement from 150) to my lowest weight of 113lbs. I still am unsure how it dropped so quickly. I've been in denial about my eating disorder for a while. Ever since I picked up smoking and drinking coffee, I thought I was cured since I wasn't taking diet pills or purging. I know I use it as a tool though because recently there have been many reports of people hospitalized because of vape use and I use mine the same amount as the people being put into comas. I'm terrified.

In the last 5 months or so I've gained weight back and waver between 127-130lbs. I feel horrible. Everyday I see a picture of me from last year in my Snapchat memories and it breaks my heart because I want to be skinny again. Today for a school project I had to have my roommate take photos of me around campus and when I look at the pictures, I want to go to the bathroom and purge. As a fashion major, I love clothes and can't even find the confidence to wear what I want because I feel fat.

I also really do want to quit smoking for my own health but I'm dependent on it to use the bathroom regularly and I'm terrified of weight gain. If anyone can give advice on dealing with my constipation (lol this is so cringy for me to write and I've never addressed this with anyone except a therapist who royally screwed me over) or can help give me some advice on any of the issues mentioned, I'd deeply appreciate it with all of my heart. I can't stand the thought of gaining weight. It will destroy me, but I know my vaping habit will do the same :(

I just feel like I'll carry my eating disorder with me forever, and that's a scary thought.",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

Such was the elaborate panic attack I had yesterday, over the phone, to my parents. There were tears. There was a failed plan to put some in a suitcase. I thought I’d just have to make peace with it all.

But *then* I woke up this morning to the news that they have sourced kabocha *seeds*—and all the equipment one could ever need to grow them—and planted five in the yard. My father even prepared a little paintbrush to pollinate them. They’re sending progress pictures.

"Concern for a Family Member My grandmother has been drinking for a long time now. She started to drink heavily about 15 years ago due to depression from financial and relationship issues. In present time now, those problems have gone away and she's just addicted at this point, and it's affected her health very noticably.
She's a functioning alcoholic but only during the morning to mid afternoon, so she usually has her first drink at about 5pm. Its gotten to the point where she is throwing up every other night and I know it's because of the alcohol. The problem here is that she's stubborn.  She thinks she's getting sick because of every other reason but the alcohol, she has no mindfulness of how much she's drinking whatsoever.
I need help on how to get this through to her. I've tried to talk to her in the past but it always ends the same way. She gets upset and stomps off, thinking I'm attacking her when I'm just concerned for her well being.

I have a choice between making a change or committing suicide. I'm going to try to change. I'm at a new college. I feel completely alone here. I am completely alone here. I've made many amazing friendships elsewhere, but those are scattered miles and miles away from me. I used to drink to party.....in earlier years of college and in high school. Now it just fills the voids. My inadequacies. My lack of any friendship at all at this new place. I started using it to beat my social anxiety, now that I have to quit I have to figure out how I'm going to not act like a total weirdo in public. I'll have to come to terms with the many things in my life I'm not particularly fond of.....My past, my mistakes, my somewhat toxic family. It stops the pain when I drink it, but sometimes not even during that anymore, because it's typically solitary drinking.

I'm too busy as a student to detox or go to rehab. If I feel like I'm going to die I might try to ween, but I don't think I'm even capable of that. I'm just going to hope stopping doesn't kill me. It filled a void for so long, without it a lot of me is going to feel empty. I hope I can find something to fill that void back up. I hope I can do this, because I'm so lonely and I think about suicide constantly now. I'm so fucking scared. I'm too scared to leave my apartment to get food. I don't know what to think, or what to do, or anything.

I know I have a problem and 99% of the time I can handle it and say no to drinking but there's another 1% where I'm feeling vulnerable or I feel like I can handle myself and not take it to excess.

I guess I'm mainly hoping someone can give me advice on how to navigate those feelings of being better cause I'm obviously not. And I don't miss alcohol most of the time but then there's times the cravings are so strong I can't control myself and it makes me scared.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"ADHD, Alcohol &amp; Self-Control Hey Redditors - I’ve been a passive reader of this sub for some time, but have decided to make my first post on an issue that particularly affects me, and might affect some of you too! I’m 19 years old and have been privately diagnosed with ADHD inattentive, and some ASD traits too.

I should start by saying that I don’t think I have an alcohol ‘problem’ in the traditional sense, but that the issue I have is something I see in lots of different parts of my life. When I drink, I am incredibly poor at self-limiting on the volume I drink. I’m very in control in regards to only drinking sporadically and feel no emotional dependence on alcohol, but when I drink, I drink too much too fast and lack the ability to pace myself unlike my friends. Due to having a moderate tolerance, this doesn’t end in awful circumstances but does mean that I don’t really enjoy nights out to the fullest extent because I’m always very intoxicated and at the upper limit of in-control drunk.

I feel like this is a self-control, impulsive issue that I have with alcohol, but I think I can summarise it as a belief that more of something is good, which is obviously wrong but it seems like my brain doesn’t compute the idea of moderation very well. I can apply this principle to lots of other things in my life, from coffee to studying and even budgeting. I feel like I only have two modes: nothing or everything, and with alcohol obviously thats more of an issue. 

I do wholeheartedly believe this is not a problem around alcohol (although if you disagree please do say) but a broader issue of impulsive self-control issues. I guess my question is, does anyone else experience this problem, and how (if at all) do you combat it? What I want is to be able to drink ‘responsibly’ and get rid of the thoughts in my head that usually encourage me to go all or nothing.

I wish someone in my life would be able to just once make me feel like it's not a big deal when I screw up. I wish I had someone to say ""It's okay. You messed up, but you can get back up and try again."" I wish it didn't have to feel like the world was ending. I know that's not realistic, but sometimes I feel like the stacking disapproval and disappointment from the people contributes to my relapses.

"Did I push myself too much? New plan of action? A few days I posted about talking to my psychiatrist about increasing my Ritalin dosage as 60mg didn't seem to work anymore and my BPD symptoms like urge to self-harm and intrusive suicidal thoughts were returning.

First of all, my situation is uncommon as I have become friends with my psychiatrist and only see her privately now. She still prescribes my meds when I need refills, gives me some advice here and there but won't do therapy with me anymore. I wanted to talk about my meds on Thursday but didn't have a chance to do so. I may do so tomorrow, but I have since noticed some interesting things:

I took Thursday and all of next week off from work because of my emotional state: I just felt like I needed a break. I also decided not to study for online university until Monday and have a ""wellness weekend"".
Amazingly my mental health is much better since Thursday! I didn't have a single negative thought! But most importantly I'm sleeping 9-10 hours a night and rest a bit in the afternoons. I've just realized that I was pushing my self a lot over the last few months: I would try to start studying within 30 minutes after waking up and started feeling guilty if I didn't start within an hour (including on weekends). After studying I would quickly quickly shower, get dressed (yes I studied in my PJs to save time) have lunch and head to work. After work I'd get home, have dinner within 30 minutes and spend the evening trying to relax on reddit an youtube. If I didn't work I'd go and see my horses in the afternoon, but again trying to save as much time as possible to study. Of course I couldn't relax in the evenings and ended up going to bed too late and still trying to wake up early.

I've just realized I've been stupid and all my symptoms were due to a chronic lack of sleep... Now I need to come up with a new and better adjusted schedule. Any suggestions? Am also considering looking for a new therapist to help me learn being more gentle with myself.

Tl;Dr: I spent the last few months studying too much and not sleeping enough... nearly started self-harming again due to fatigue...

Blacking out for the first time I’m in college (18M) and last Friday was my first time blacking out. My friends tell me that I was unconscious and pale and unresponsive. They tried snapping their fingers at me and one even said they slapped me like 5 times to try to wake me up. This was without success as I was completely unresponsive. They took me to the hospital but decided not to admit me because they saw I was still breathing (kind of weird logic but I’m glad it worked out). I was in this state for about three hours until falling asleep. When I woke up and they told me all this I was worried and embarrassed. The next morning I kept throwing up and couldn’t eat the entire day as my stomach felt horrible. It was something I never want to go through again. I guess what I’m asking is if this caused me irreversible damage or if I will be good as long as I don’t drink as much anymore. I don’t even feel like wanting to drink again. ,alcoholism,alcoholism

I just have mixed feelings about the whole thing. I've mentioned it to a few doctors in my adult life and they have sort of giving me dismissive ""I don't think you have Asperger's that sounds like a misdiagnosis"" response.

"Am I on autism spectrum? I know I have problems, but not sure if I fit in. 
I was normal child, but from the age of 4-5 the hell begun and even now, I am considered as ""just weird member of family"". 
But honestly, as I get older, it becomes more and more difficult to cope with my ""weirdo"" self and sometimes I just want to die to stop this torture called life. 
So here we are:
- As a child, I refused to speak, talk or even look at strangers/people outside from my immediate family
- Now I find it difficult to look in someone's eyes. I avoid it if i can, or just look at the forehead to make an impression I am looking. Eye contact makes me super anxious/insecure
- I have troubles to identify people's mood and behaviours. Often they have to tell me directly what they think/want/why they did this or that.
- Noise and people make me anxious and irritated. I have full-time work which allows me to have my own closed and quiet space, otherwise I just get annoyed, cant concentrate and have this strange feeling of ""shut up or i will harm either you or myself"" and I have to go away or I will bite myself or break something.
-Sometimes, when I feel totally irritated, the only way to calm down is rocking movements. Just rocking inward-forward or move my legs, make something repeatable.
- I have normal family,  no neglect or anything but somehow when I was about 18 and went to college, I realized that I did not know the basic rules of society: like how to behave when visiting someone, how to make friends, not insult someone. How to say hello or goodbye when leaving. I had to LEARN everything my siblings already somehow knew.

"I have always been paranoid, but now it’s getting so severe to where I don’t want to leave my house. My therapist told me I wasn’t schizophrenic because at the time I was aware of the delusions. I started getting paranoid at a very young age. It started off with being so afraid of staying in the car while my parents were at the gas station. I would have full blown panic attacks, thinking somebody was watching me and was going to get me. It then escalated to general feelings of people watching me, having cameras on me, and other things I want to mention but I’m too scared to, especially on the internet. I don’t even want to say them out loud, I want to write down on paper the issues, so that way nobody can hear me if they’re listening.

I’m starting to not trust people more and more. I deleted all of my social media profiles in fear someone was keeping an eye on me. I’m really fucking afraid to leave my house, even for therapy and doctors appointments. I have a bad fear of driving too, for the same paranoid reasons. I’m starting college, or I’m supposed to next month. I have to take the city bus since I can’t drive. I have a guitar class and I’m afraid to bring my guitar because I feel like everyone will stare and i get tense being on the spot and noticed, it’s like carrying a big backpack around, it’s noticeable and annoying and I want to be noticed as little as possible. I feel like a higher power is keeping an eye on me, and they’re deciding when to kill me, based on certain goals I do/don’t have in life. I feel bad, I’m always aware that I’m being paranoid, but in certain moments it’s hard to get out of my head and I don’t know what’s real.

"My parents know nothing about me but are adamant that im autistic So I can understand why they think this, from the general picture of me that they get I seem pretty quiet and reserved, I do my work at school and dont usually misbehave, but what they dont see and the part I cant tell them for obvious reasons, im actually really extroverted, whenever im out with my friends im the one in the group that talks to strangers on the street or does stupid dances in public, but they dont know that, they only have a one sided view of me.

It also doesnt help that theyre quite old, they dont understand the jokes that I make or the memes that I say, this is probably why they think im fucking autistic, but at this point im in too deep, like I got to the doctors and I just sit there in listening to them tell the doctors things about me that I know as me simply arents true. For example, I started going to the gym and eating healthy and ive been doing it now for about 6 months (6 pac gang wooooooooooow) anyway, they said to the doctor when he asked them if I have problems eating different types of foods that arent the same (common trait for aspies) and no, I dont have a problem eating any food, I just dont like to eat like shit everyday like they do, but of course they said that im a picky eater, like I know this isnt the truth, but I know they would never understand this type of stuff, I cant convince an old person too look at memes, shes the type of person that shares fucking minion memes to her facebook, thats what I mean when I say ""old person""

I cant speak to fucking anyone about this because they dont understand, and this is honestly really getting me down because I know for a fact that im not autistic, but they only believe what they read on facebook, and well you can fucking tell what theyre like if they read facts off of facebook

"I think I may be having PTSD I’m the youngest in my family. My brother is a few years older and we grew up in a one parent household. When our mom was at work he would watch me. I remember some good times like when he took me fishing or hiking. They don’t outweigh the bad. Thinking back I never told anyone except a therapist how awful my brother was to me. He would do things that weren’t as severe such as make food that was horribly spicy and make me try it as a “joke.” He pushed me down the stairs as a “joke.” 
He stuck nasty bugs in my shoe, etc. I guess “normal” things a brother would do? 

What really sticks in my mind is when he would pin me down and suffocate me with a pillow. I remember screaming and he would do it until I stopped. I remember him saying he wouldn’t let me go until I stopped screaming. I remember the feeling of being crushed and not being able to breathe. I honestly cannot remember how often this happened to me when I was younger. Another thing he would do to me was pin me down and grab a knife and pretend he was going to stab me and then at the last second turn the knife. 

All of this happened at least 20-25 years ago. The reason I think I’m having PTSD is because if I feel at any time that “crushing sensation” I feel major anxiety and feel like I need space. It happened to me yesterday when I was at the dentist and I had to sit up and just take a breather. The same happens with me if my husband and I are being intimate and he is on top and everything is fine then all of a sudden we have to stop because I’m feeling that crushing sensation. 

I’m fully estranged from my family for multiple reasons but wanted to share my story. I see a therapist for this and many reasons but lately I feel like this is coming up more and more. I do feel like it’s PTSD and a mixture of anxiety and depression.

"How did your addiction start? Hi! I have been drinking quite a bit during my teenage years. Nothing crazy, just going out with friends. With adulthood (18 where I am) I started to drink more and more with my friends. About two years ago I started being cool with drinking by myself. I don’t usually do it often anymore but last night I drank way too much all by myself. Today is the 4th day in a row that I’m waking up feeling like shit because I drank too much the night before. My friend has told me before that my drinking is a bit concerning but not a huge red flag. Now I’m worried, how close am I to becoming an alcoholic? For the past two days I did kind of feel like kicking off the day with some beer or red wine, so that’s certainly a bad sign. My brother has been an alcoholic since I can think and I don’t want that for myself. I’m easily addicted (weed and tobacco).

"I have a really hard time recognizing triggers, and it’s debilitating tw: general negativity, light trauma talk, symptoms Hello, 18 yr old here, with a long history of struggling with PTSD. This is in part a ramble, I’m not feeling too great today.

I recently moved from my home town, where a good deal of trauma took place. I’m trying to, I guess, rebuild myself as a person, and mend some of myself before things get to be too much.

Some part of me really thought recovery would be easy. In part, it was because my family and friends expected change to be rapid, constant, upward, and successful. Yet, I feel like my symptoms are starting to get worse. Panic, dissociation, paranoia and flashbacks often hit me without warning often. I have a hard time leaving the house, or even getting things done while I’m isolated. It gets somewhat easier when there’s people around- but it’s unrealistic to always have someone whom I feel safe around.

I often don’t have someone to call or text when these sudden breaking points happen. Every instance I’ve tried to work something out with either a doctor, professor, or friend, the dialogue teeters off. I don’t know what’s triggering them. It’s getting overwhelming, and I’m kind of afraid of what my future holds. I’m trying my best to be positive. I am in therapy, but it is far from regular due to the lack of availability in my town.

"My ADHD is roadblocking my life and I'm having trouble getting medication back on For context, I live in an area with pretty bad meth problem and they don't normally prescribe meth products of any kind here no matter what. It's a stupid policy, and the medicines like strattera are too laden with awful side-effects to work.

To make matters worse, the methylphenidate (which, while not as effective as it could be, at least partially worked) isn't going to be re-prescribed to me in part because my doctor lied to me about being able to go back on that if the straterra didn't pan out.

This disease has been destroying my life. I've got endless anxieties about my inability to focus or get important life things done, and the ""just do it"" mentality only gets me so far. I'm incapable of trying stronger medicine (and as a kid, the higher doses of ritalin I took reduced my emotional capacity to ANGER AND DISDAIN in exchange for that focus) and I'm just... not really sure what to do at all!

I have the intelligence to do well, for sure, but I can't focus long enough to take advantage of that! It's like having a fully functioning sports car but without a damn gearshift so you're stuck petering out in first gear.

Any advice is welcome, structuring has been a nonstarter for me so far since, ironically, the ADHD undercuts that and I wind up forgetting about the note I took about the notes I need to take etc etc etc.

and i don't care about him, he was incredibly emotionally abusive and a huge jackass to me for nearly all of the three years we were together. i dumped him over two years ago now and i know he has dated a lot of girls since (can't seem to keep one, i wonder why). but this girl did NOT look anything like me, she looks way older, noticeably bigger, just not... anything like me. for some reason, i immediately got nauseous and couldn't eat any of my food. i physically could not take a bite if i tried. and it's been like three hours and i'm still nauseous and pissed off.

i feel like a terrible person because part of me wishes i could tell this girl what a cheating shitbag my ex is, part of me wants him to never find anyone who will love him so he's miserable forever, but most of me is pissed off that my sister thought this girl looked ""just like"" me when i see no resemblance. i honestly feel like just fasting until i clearly have no resemblance to literally anyone. i feel like such a superficial jerk.

went out to rage run my feelings away and missed beating my 5k personal record by 18 seconds because i couldn't even have one good thing happen today!!!

sorry for the rant... i don't really have anyone to talk to and i wish i could just pretend my ex doesn't exist anymore but now i'm just a mess of all the horrible memories 🙃🙃🙃

"My FWB(M25) Of Three Months Triggered My (NB20) PTSD. How Do I Proceed After Violent Outburst? Hello Reddit! This got removed from r/relationships and was told to post this on here. Obviously using a throwaway here.

A few weeks ago, I went out with one of my favourite FWB (Lets call him Alex) and things ended up getting really fucked up. We were heading downtown for some Bubble Tea and ended up using a local streetcar to get there. While we were on the streetcar, some drunk/high dude walks past us and trips over Alex's foot. Alex proceeds to give the guy a little wave and apologizes for tripping him as the guy picks himself up and walks away. 

I dont know why (be it the alcohol/drugs, him misunderstanding Alex, etc.), but the man stops, turns around, and stomps towards us. Then he proceeded to flip Alex's hat off, scream something along the lines of ""Who do you think youre trying to fight?"", and punches Alex in the face. Of course, in self defense, Alex punches him back and it turns into a full on brawl. 

Something you should know is that Alex recently got into an accident, which fucked up his neck. Sometime during the fight, the drunk/high guy laid hands on Alex's neck and Alex COMPLETELY lost it! Alex proceeds to overpower the guy and starts choking him out. Usually, one would let go when they know they have completely overpowered their victim and walk off. BUT, Alex lost all control of himself and looked like he was trying to kill the man. The streetcar driver and fellow passengers were trying to rip him off, but no one could do it. Finally, I yelled at him to stop and I guess my voice snapped him out of it. He drops him (man is literally motionless on the floor) and walks towards me, saying we need to get out and walk instead.

Everyone who witnessed the fight proceeds to congratulate Alex, saying the man deserved to get his ass beat and all that. I, on the other hand, was completely scared shitless and didnt know what to do. A part of me wanted to run away and never see his face again, but the other part of me needed to stay with him to make sure he was okay (the man did some damage to his neck/head and I didnt wanna leave him alone). We proceeded to go get bubble tea and act like nothing happened. The whole time, however, I was scared out of my mind and trying so hard to hold myself down/prevent myself from having a full blown panic attack.

It is a good time to mention that I am an abuse victim (Dad and Ex-Boyfriend) and have pretty bad PTSD + a bunch of other mental health problems. I have a very huge fear of men (especially those who have power over me) and have begun doing this FWB thing to help me overcome it. Ive been fucked over a lot during my journey by other men (Got ghosted, was secretly filmed when I clearly told him I didnt let first timers film, was lied to about various things, etc.), so I really thought I found someone I could finally say I trust. 

But after that incident, I cant even think about talking to him/meeting up with him cause all I can see now when I think of him is my abusers (specifically my dad). It fucks me up just thinking about him and triggers my PTSD, causing really bad freakouts + intensifies my suicidal thoughts.

I trusted this man so much. I let him fuck me, invited him to my place, let him sleep over, hell, I even let him meet with my family. I never let anybody else do any of that stuff except for him. Now, I feel like I made a mistake and cannot trust him anymore. I feel like I cant trust any of them anymore. Im trying so hard not to let this get to me and skew my perception of men, but damn. 

So my question is, how should I proceed with this? He is genuinely a good guy and hes one of the sweetest ones Ive ever met. Hes an amazing friend and is very fun to be around. I understand that he had to fight to protect himself and that the person he was when he lost his cool is not really him. I understand that he did not mean to escalate the fight and almost kill the guy, but no matter what I do, I just cant stop being scared of him. Its so fucked, but I dont know if I can go back to thinking of him the same way. This is really affecting my relationships with other men and is fucking up my progress with getting over my fear of men. I love him as a friend and want to go around this as best as I possibly can. He deserves that much.

So, what should I do? 

TL;DR- My FWB got into a brawl with a drunk/high guy and almost killed him out of self defense. Triggered my PTSD and now all I can think of is my abuser when I think of/see him. Really fucking up my trust with men and I dont know how to proceed. Please help me.",ptsd,ptsd

"External or internal attribution: self-esteem, self-efficacy, and learned helplessness I am struggling with self-esteem and anxiety and have recently been diagnosed with ADD at my 30s. I have been doing a lot of research and working at different forms of therapy to find out what works best.
In my research I seem to have found some conflicting advice on how to go about externally or internally attributing stuff.

One thing I am happy with is an audio therapy guide for building self-esteem. In this guide they teach you how self-esteem works and for instance they say that what a lot of people with low self-esteem keep doing is internally attributing causes for issues they see around them. Basically they blame themselves for instance when feeling like they are being laughed at or when someone lets them down.
So the way to deal with this is to look for other factors outside of yourself that could explain the behavior you noticed.

Then a few days ago I overheard a conversation about learned helplessness and it sounded interesting in light of my research so I decided to google it.
What I found was a very familiar feeling for me but alsof something I really recognize in other people around me struggling with self-esteem issues.
Researching it further showed that apparently people dealing with learned helplessness do too much external attribution where they should do internal attribution to feel more in control of their situation.

So I found this very informational video from Khan Academy about self-esteem, self-efficacy and locus of control for people that want to learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcLKlPTG97k

I have an ADD brain dealing with these things and I know that I should be externally attributing more but then again there is the self-efficacy thing that needs to be trained so I should be internally attributing more. Which to do when?",adhd,adhd
"Started with IF, now idk As the title mentions, I started IF March of 2018. My intentions were to, of course lose weight, and eat healthier. I did 16:8, then went on to 23:1, then continued to extend it to 48, 72, and my longest fast which is 5 days. Initially, i was amazed at the self-control i didn't know I had in me. I became better at moderating meals and even choosing healthier options when I do get to eat.

The problem is that, fast forward to almost a year later, I no longer have a structure. I've thrown the ""You have to eat 3 times a day"" and ""You have to eat or else you'll get sick"" ideologies out the window a long time ago. For the past few months now, I am spiraling between fasting for 2-5 days and binging. I keep having these thoughts of ""Well, I need to eat bcuz I wont be able to in the next few days"", ""I can easily lose this if I just fast"", ""Why can't I stop eating?!"" It's either all or nothing for me when it comes to eating. I thought it was normal until I started reading abt ED posts and relating to them.

I want to stop binging because sometimes I'd just be binging continuously for days by justifying I will fast tomorrow which usually gets pushed back and back and back. I'm worried abt gaining weight and it distracts me from studying for my exams.

I have looked into symptoms for close to a year now and the deeper I look into it the more and more I'm convincing myself that I've been suffering from this my entire life. What really pushed me into looking at symptoms was researching for motivation issues. The simplest tasks to the more difficult ones I'm putting off and procrastinating.

Then she says, not cruelly mind you, 'You'll be working independently, no-one will be there to babysit you,'

Mmm, dig that knife nice and deep into my self esteem. Nice choice of the word babysit. 

Yknow, she made her point. No need to fucking kick me while I'm already down, even if you had no idea. But now truly I feel the weight of the word 'Infantalising'.

"Meds are helping me focus, but I fixate on the wrong things I'm currently taking Vyvanse and while it does help me to focus, I tend to get focused on unnecessary stuff or can't seem to control where that focus is directed. 

I want to read something, but when I start to do that, I have the thought that I should clean my room. While I'm cleaning I decide the vacuum cleaner itself needs to be cleaned, so I take that apart and clean it out--which was nice, because it seems to be working better now. I find that I'm doing a lot, but not exactly what I want to be doing. 

I try to buckle down and do the things I'm actually supposed to be doing, but my thoughts flit to some other trivial or unnecessary task and fixate on it until I do it. When I'm doing said task, I overdo it. I can't just take out the bag of trash in the kitchen, while I'm at it, I should go through the cabinets and toss out anything expired. I feel like my brain is hijacked until I do that task I think up--I can't just say ""later"" and focus on the work I want to do, the thought that I should sort the cabinets will keep distracting me until I do it. 

Is there a way to control this or calm it down or ignore the thoughts that I need to do all these other things while I'm trying to do some other thing? 

I also have this issue where I'm talking to myself a lot. I'll think of something, say a song, and start talking about that song and the artists who made it and interesting stuff about them or the music genre and just keep going. And sometimes I'll just waste away an hour or two just explaining things to no one. I stop when I'm with others or in public, but when I'm by myself, I tend to just speak incessantly and I'm usually a quiet, reserved sort of person.

"Was doing so well for about a month, and now i'm 5 days deep into a B/P C&amp;S relapse. I thought I had finally turned over a new leaf and beaten my ED. For the past month, I've been allowing myself to eat normally, haven't B/P'd nor C&amp;S. Now I'm all alone doing an internship in another state, and I feel like my ED's come back in full force. My AirBNB host told me to feel free to eat any of their house food.. and of course I went crazy. Frozen bagels, biscuits, cake, and spring rolls (among others) have been chewed and spat. Nuts, dates, popcorn have been B/Pd. I just finished a 1500cal nut binge that I've been unable to purge.

&amp;#x200B;

Half of me is grateful that I was unable to purge, because hopefully it puts this cycle to an end. I can't believe I've relapsed again after doing so well. I'm so tempted to wake up tomorrow and restrict, but I know it's the exact opposite of what I should do. I'm guessing I've already gained about 1-2lbs of fat from the BP, C&amp;S episodes from the past 5 days and I'm going crazy.

"wtf do I do if the new roommate has a major mental illness and knowingly refuses to take their medication and her family is little to no help. Ok so I got this new roommate been like a week and about 3 days in she started to talk to herself and a day later she showed me her arm and asked if I had ever woken up with mystery bruises or marks.  So naturally, I sent a text to her sister (only contact I have of hers because the girl cut off the rest of her family because they wanted her to get help) and told her about it (btw I had no idea at the time she was a paranoid schizophrenic not on medication and in denial). And her sister and family knowingly let her move on her own without giving any heads up to me or other roommates about it and we were completely blindsided by it. Her sister originally was very helpful and was like I'll call her doctor and help to get her admitted, now fast forward to 3 days later (roommate is still talking to herself) because the sister was like we need the social worker to come in and see her first, so I waited and took time off from work and class to be here. And later when I questioned the sister on what is happening because I've been here all day she has been giving me the run around all day and finally, I told her I need to know what's going on so I can prepare for it. So she goes and makes it seem like I'm bugging her and making this out to be a bigger deal than it is and tells me, ""I don't have to do this you know"".

So makes us feel super shitty about being concerned about our safety and well-being as well as the new roommates about asking her to help with her sister who at night (2-3am) talks to herself about souls, demons and how some people are demons corrupting regular souls. I believe that the new roommate needs urgent care and this is not something I am able to do or know what to do. 

Now I'm like what do I do next if she's not willing to help out and get her the right care? Am I obligated to look after her because she lives here?

My partner works with autistic youth and is pretty sure I am on the spectum although I don't need much support to live a normal life (ie she doesn't take care of me). A friend of mine went the doctor for a diagnosis and said it was a real nightmare having to go through so many intense interviews with various people. Firstly, why do they make it so hard when obviously most autistic and even neurotypical people would be stressed out by the interviews? Secondly, how much of a benefit is there in being diagnosed? My friend did it so he could access support in the workplace but I thankfully work from home. 

I would like to talk to a therapist and get a better understanding of how my brain works, but don't want to pay loads of time and money in getting diagnosed only to find that there is little help available even so.

At some point I decided to stand up to the voice and would yell at it in my own head to shut up. Interrupting it with my own thoughts. This eventually escalated to me yelling shut up out loud over the voice. I think this worked because by age 10 the voice was gone.

I had some learning moments. And I even found out what comic I actually want to write/draw! I might post it here soon because it has to do with my experiences as some who's on the spectrum and has ADHD. But there were really really REALLY tough moments, one big ass meltdown from me and one really bad PTSD nightmare.

A lot of times I was very homesick. Very VERY homesick. And a lot of times I thought I was going to explode on my stepdaughter. She's very well behaved in a lot of aspects, but a lot of her 'quirks' could ignite literally anyone on the spectrum to go into, like, perpetual meltdown. Mainly her questioning EVERYTHING (in times where we don't have time to question things), not understanding her tone and always wanting to argue and 'trick/troll' you. Ironically, I think she's also on the spectrum with ADHD. Especially with how she takes even the gentlest of criticism so personally. Her dad definitely is on the spectrum.

We saw some really cool things and had some cool experiences I'll cherish for the rest of my life.

Was it worth it? Tbh I'm still deciding that. I know some people will regard that as an ungrateful response, but I'm not going to lie about my feelings just to appease some.

"Hello 👋 ( need advice) 

I was diagnosed with PTSD this year. At first I was in denial about the whole thing because I really thought I had bipolar disorder. After months of asking my therapist questions whether this or that was ’normal’ for someone who has PTSD, I finally came into terms that I do in fact have PTSD. 

Before all of the therapists, medications, psychiatrists, and diagnose, I was a completely different person. I was sociable, had friends, didn't care what people thought about me, went to church, went to college..

"Does it actually get better For the first 14 years of my life, I learned that footsteps up the stairs meant you were supposed to run and hide. Loud noises unequivocally meant that someone was getting hurt. My name was my greatest enemy because every time I heard it, it meant I was next. 

I still can't sleep unless everyone is in bed. If I hear people moving, my heart starts trying to rip itself from my chest. The moment someone starts to raise their voice, I think of all the ways I could lie my way out of whatever was my fault this time. 

And holy shit it is so fucking annoying oh my god. I was so disciplined and so focused. Anything I wanted, I could do if I wanted it badly enough. But this? This I can't control. I do drugs, I cut myself, I go between eating a thousand calories in a sitting to not being able to eat for days. It's so stupid and so useless. When my friends laugh too loud, my first instinct is to want to recede into my own body and whither to a husk! 

How incredibly senseless is my body? Why can't I quiet my heart or still my hands? 

Does this shit actually go away? I'm in a good environment now and my life is, by all accounts, fantastic. Everything outside of my locus of force is pretty great.

"Need some autism tests. This post might be offend someone and if it does, I apologise, this post is not meant to be hurtful or disrespectful in anyways, but merely a way of understanding.   I will first give you the background, the symptoms that I have found the background evidence of myself (example if I display these traits) and any other business.  

This is to get a good representation of if I have traits of autism.  I will attempt to be as unbiased as I possibly can and provide references as needed. 

The two sources of traits that I will be comparing myself to is:

\-  [https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/asd.aspx](https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/asd.aspx) 

\-  [http://autismni.org/characteristics-of-autism.html](http://autismni.org/characteristics-of-autism.html)   
There are other sources around, but I picked two sites at random.

&amp;#x200B;

Note:  I am aware that the term autism is a spectrum and that everyone, in some degree is within that spectrum, but some are more in that spectrum that others.  I will attempt to help people understand as best as I am able to, if you feel that I have not given the correct message over, please tell me and I will try to re-write it so may better understand.

I am an adult and I have been initially diagnosed with bipolar.  While that might be true, I don't think it is and would like advice from those that have exposure to it and see it we marry up with traits.

Final, final, I am not saying I am, I am not saying I am not autistic.  I am thinking that there is more to it (such as nurturing, background, social interaction, environmental exposure, etc) that might fill in the voids that people consider part of the autistic traits.  That is a theory at the moment, and one that I have not proven.  Mainly because I have investigated yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The things I know I do that are highly probable in autistic people:

\- I love being alone.

\- I have no filter in what and how I say it.

\- I love routine and order in my life. 

\- I don't understand jokes.

\- I am very literal in what I and other people say.

\- I want to be on my own.

\- I have always acted and felt different to other kids.  I haven't every really fitted in anywhere really.

\- I sometimes become highly focused.  To a point where that's all I obsessively think about.

\- I am not empathetic or sympathetic

\- I can relate to women younger than me and men much older than myself.  Not in a sexual way, but it's what I find a more natural rapport happens.

\- I hate being touched.

\- I struggle maintaining friendships/relationships.

\- I hate loud noises.

\- There are some textures/fibers that I can't touch.  Example nylon and the fur on a peach.

\- Hate loud noises.  It's kinda messes with me?  Where I can't really do that much after and I require at least two days in quiet to reset my brain.

To counter this argument, you could argue that some were the direct result of a lack of nurturing.  Example, parents never touched a child, bad childhood experiences, just how someone is born.  There are many deviance's and reasons to why someone is like they are.  Again, This is how I am understanding it, but if I am incorrect then it's nice to have a different view on things.

It's not just this, I struggle with things that other people take for granted: the ability to know when you're in danger, I don't understand particular circumstances, such as the world is confusing to me.  eg - why can't buildings be exactly the same? why as things so crooked and uneven (such as uneven paths.) I can't give maybe examples left, right and center, but he above is a good example.

Because of that, I think slow, it takes me ages to grasp new concepts, or, sometimes I don't get sentences or how people word or say something, and that's the most frustrating thing.  I see people just get and understand things and I am kinda here left on my own to do my own things, which is nice, but on another scale isn't.

"In need of research participants (All welcome)  

Hi I am a masters student at Northumbria University UK, looking for partipants to take part in a study looking at belief and individual differences and ASD traits. I am in need of a diverse sample of participants to be able to have a fully representative sample.

Anyone can take part. The survey is anonymous, and takes around 8-10 minutes. There are a variety of surveys in it: belief scale, autism quotient (10 item), anthropomorphism scale, teleological reasoning.

The aim is to assess how religious beliefs differ depending on ASD traits, and if they interact with cognitive biases such as anthopomorphism (which is proposed as being partly involved in the existence of belief in supernatural). Previous research has shown that adults with ASD tend to anthropomorphise (assign human characteristics to non-human objects) at a higher rate than control groups.

"Three years ago, I had recently been fired twice in a row when my gf broke up with me. Now things are better than ever. I was diagnosed as a child and stopped treatment during college. After college, I got an office job I couldn't stand because it was so dull. I found another job, but shortly after I got fired for being difficult to work with. I found another job after that, but I lost that one too for having a poor work ethic. As if that wasn't enough, my girlfriend at the time broke up with me a few weeks later because of my poor empathy skills.


At first I became pretty depressed. After a bit of that I got back in touch with my therapist, found a specialty adhd clinic, and restarted treatment. I went on a 7 week, 14,000 mile solo roadtrip, which gave me _a lot_ of time to think. When I returned home, I enrolled in a vocational program and completely changed career fields (from finance to programming).


When I finished the program, I spent a short time still in finance working as the controller at a startup. I was underqualified, overworked, and it was more responsibility than I had ever had before. Nonetheless, thanks to working so hard to get my shit together so quickly, I completely smashed it. The CEO was speechless--he said he had never seen anyone learn anything so quickly. After a short time, I decided it wasn't for me and tendered my resignation. Even though I left them in a tough spot, I handled it so professionally that just recently the COO asked me if I wanted to come back and be their controller again (!!!).


After leaving the startup, I took a programming internship at a different tech company. I smashed the shit out of that too, and at the end of the internship they offered a permanent position making almost as much as I made at the startup.


That was two years ago. One year ago, they gave me a 15 percent raise. *Today*, my boss gave me a 12 percent raise, told me they wanted to give me another raise midyear if they can, asked for my help negotiating the biggest deal my company has ever made, and told me I could move my stuff to a better workspace. I've been told my communication skills are better than anyone else on my team and my boss actively seeks my advice on management and interpersonal situations. Among friends, I went from being known as a terrible listener to being the best listener many people know. I've been dating a wonderful woman for two years and couldn't be happier. Things aren't perfect, but when adhd-related problems arise I have the tools to recognize and work around them.


TL;DR: Untreated adhd ruined everything. I got my shit together, changed careers, unlearned and relearned basically every habit in my life within 6 months, and now I'm more successful than most of my peers. If I did it, you can too.",adhd,adhd

I have many reasons to drink, but I have more to not drink. I REALLY want to be sober. I actually just got out of jail last week and before I knew it, I was sneaking drinks to help fall asleep.

I’m currently on my parents couch and they are doing everything humanly possible to help me and they were crushed to find me drinking. My mom has soo much anger and rage she wants to get out on me, but gets mad when I say “I know” or don’t respond. I do this because I have no excuses and I hate myself sooooo much for all of this. She has a right to yell, scream and hate me. I know the best apology is changed behavior, so all I can do is keep going to meetings and working on truly becoming sober. I want it more than life itself, but I get in my own way.

"A few questions from a parent Our 11-year-old high-functioning son goes through periods of difficult behavior (lots of anger/yelling/slamming doors, rudeness, disruption at school, with occasional incidents at home of hitting, biting, and attempts to leave the house). These periods typically last 1-2 weeks and often seem triggered by a significant change of schedule (days off from school) and/or stress. He takes generic ritilin primarily for school. Once he comes out of these episodes, his behavior is generally very good. He has a therapy session once per week but he does not seem to be applying much of anything from that.

1. Is there a name for these kind of extended periods of such behavior? My understanding is that a ""meltdown"" is not such an extended thing.  

2. I assume this kind of thing is pretty common. Is it? Are there some known tactics to help bring cut these episodes short?  

3. We worry about what happens if he still has extreme aggression when he's older and bigger than us. Any tips?

I used to be productive for 12 hours when I was initially put on it however I have already seen a decrease down to 8 or 9 now. I have observed my other friends that have adhd and it seems like eventually they all fall off and have tolerance issues. Is there anyway that I can maximize my time before the eventual tolerance issues? Behavioral and lifestyle changes? Med breaks? Supplements? Any other pre-med students diagnosed.

"Relationship issues: about to tell BF of 4 months to get therapy/treatment, or I'm out :/ Sorry, it became TL, but I needed to talk to someone about it, and most people I know wouldn't understand it completely. 


In summary: I don't know if it sounds harsh, but I'm tired of trying and having the feeling he doesn't see that I'm trying, or what I have done for him/us. BF has severe ADHD, like **really severe**, but doesn't take meds, not sure why, as he doesn't like talking about it, feels ashamed etc. He was diagnosed a few years ago as an adult, and doctors said they'd never seen such a high score in the symptoms test like his. He just started talking to a psychologist online, but I don't know which approach she has. I have tried to help in many ways and some things improved, many have not. What hurts me most now is the feeling that he forgets about me, like, that I exist, and that I want the best for him. We fight constantly and I think of breaking up every time. More details below.


When he first told me he had ADHD I though it was something mild, and I had not much idea about it, but as symptoms started showing off so much, I started reading articles, and saw him in every single topic here. I showed him a topic with tips from others with ADHD and suggested if we could take a look and find something that could work for him, but again, he doesn't like talking about it. 


Long story short, we are 36 and we kinda moved in together right away. The first 2 months were awesome because I was his hyperfocus (I call them obsessions): he would message/call me several times, cook, clean, do laundry, brush teeth, shower etc. Then he lost his job, so lots of time for several ""obsessions""/hobbies, no sleeping, eating hot dogs and cookies for dinner, not doing anything in the house, etc. Let alone the heavy smoking and other issues like family stuff, or this HUGE debt he has from past bad decisions, feels angry and ashamed about it, so does nothing about it.


As I've learned more about his ADHD, I've tried to create organization systems so he gets more or less things going: budget spreadsheet, bought markers, white board, post its, we share Trello, Google Docs, Calendar and Keep, where I put all the alarms and so on. I message him to remind him to eat, or to feed his daughter. I don't mind doing most things, even gave up on asking him to help me clean the house. But I get super upset when I'm cleaning and he's throwing stuff on the floor right behind me, for example. Or when he has his RSDs and anything I say can be terrible. Or when I have to stop what I'm doing to do something with him RIGHT NOW just because.


I know I'm not a monk and I can be difficult and moody, but I have *really* tried to be understanding, and sometimes I can't just shut up when I hear / feel things that hurt me. I love this guy and I know he is not his symptoms, as he has his qualities and is the sweetest bf I've had, but I'm not sure if I want to continue a relationship that I feel is doing more hurting than loving. I know it's bad, but sometimes I feel like he just wants to be with me because he needs to be with someone. 


He's had long relationships before, but let's say with women who were less independent and had these princess marriage dreams, which is far from what I am. I'm more used to being alone, although I don't mind the ""spending life together"" thing if I like the person, but I feel this is too hard :/",adhd,adhd
"Need somewhere to vent, can't talk to my therapist Tw: rape, sexual abuse nsfw Some asshole tried to tell me even though 70% of  rapes aren't reported that every woman who is raped and doesn't report is either lying because she cheated or is irresponsible for letting the man walk free and rape others.

Usually comments like these I just roll my eyes at but today it became a huge trigger. My mind went back to my ex and everything he did and for the first time in 4 years since it happened I realized I was raped. I've been lying to myself, making excuses for him, rewriting the memories in my head, trying to find any way around that word. I would say ""sexual abuse"" and ""coersion"" to minimalize what happened. ""he loved me, he didn't realize what he was doing was wrong"". This morning I suddenly remember the probably hundreds of conversations I had telling him no means no and that it wasn't ok what he was doing. He acknowledged, apologized, then said I was just too irresistible and he can't control himself at all when he's turned on, it isn't him, his dick is the one in full control.

Post break up he was desperate to have his victim back. When to great lengths, more than he ever did in the almost 2 years we were together. He did something nice I was extremely grateful for then he sat himself outside my door until I let him come ""cuddle"". He swore he wouldn't try anything, he just wanted some cuddles. I had been up for 48 hrs, anxiety was at a high, I had no strength. He stayed outside begging me for an hour, keeping me awake, until I gave in. I passed out quickly to wake up to him trying to have sex with me. I pretended I was asleep and prayed for it to stop and it never did. He then kissed me on the forehead like it was a consensual thing he did. I'm still pretending to be asleep.

For years I have lied to myself on this situation. I minimalized, excused, told myself he was young and didn't know better (we were 17-18 at the time), anything to make it not happen. I've checked on his social media ever since to make sure he hasn't been dating anyone. He still tries to twist the whole relationship like he wasn't a great bf but we had some great times.

I'm married and in a healthy relationship with someone who respects my boundaries and I constantly worry he's going to do it someone else.

It's just really hard when your brain finally shows you the truth after hiding it for so long.. I remembered what he said but had warped what i told him just to make myself feel like he just didn't understand or know. But he did. He knew. He understood what he was doing. I sat and broke down countless times and he would say his magic words then repeat the cycle.

Sorry for the long ass story, I just.... It took me 2 years to admit the sexual abuse, and another 2 for this.. I'm still having a really hard time saying the word out loud because if I do it solidifies it so I guess I'm typing it out as a next best thing. Thank you for reading this, I just needed a safe place to get my thoughts out until I can see a professional today or tomorrow 

Tldr: thank you asshole that invalidated and victim blamed the 70% of women who don't report for making it click in my head that what my ex did went past sexual abuse and he raped me and he knew what he was doing.",ptsd,ptsd

We have been together for 1.5 years.

I love him dearly and told him I love him about 6months ago. From then, I told him I love him 3-5 more times. I guess that makes it roughly once a month?

When he started pursuing me, he did say that he has never felt something so strong before.

I really want to hear that he loves me. Of course, I won’t force or pressure him to say it. I know you can’t make someone love you when they don’t.

I turned off the video I was watching so I could hear the buzzing better and the buzzing just stopped. So I turned my video back on. Then the buzzing happend again, video off, no buzzing.

"""stop wasting time and get back to work!"" - how I learned to appreciate the 'wasting time' Instead of calling it ""wasting time"" … I just call ""recharging"".  Allow me to explain...

-------

I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMMOErxtahk) the other day, and it's been a very helpful perspective shift so i thought I'd share it here.


The video is from a very smart computer security researcher, so there is a bit of a technical slant to it.

If the technical stuff piqued your curiosity, check out the rest of his channel - there's some really cool stuff there.  

If the tech stuff goes above you or bores you, no worries!  None of that has to do with the core message: 


&gt; Feeling bad about not using that recharge time to do something productive is as illogical as it is mentally harmful


	
Put simply, the ADHD brain cant be ""on"" all the time; we need time to recharge!  The ""ahha!"" moment for me was when i realized that I can usually do them together!  There's almost certainly something to learn, a curious itch to be scratched, or a new skill to develop... and it's possible to do that while recharging!


I'm super guilty of beating myself up for not getting everything crossed off today's todo list.  I know it's impossible to get as much done in a day as I'd like, and I know I get less done when I need to take breaks between tasks to ""recharge"", but I can't help but feel guilty. No matter how much I can accomplish in a day, the nagging voice starts to intrude: ""you lazy fool, how come you have 380 things still on the todo list!"" 

Rather than beat myself up for taking the breaks I know I need, I try to remember the spirit of the video:

Curiosity is boundless, weather you like it or not, so you may as well try to get some new knowledge and perhaps a new skill out of a ""recharge period""

I stood in the corner of the room, helpless as 15+ doctors ran around the room frantically trying to save my girl and my son. I genuinely had the thought of ""I am driving home after this alone with an empty car seat.""  


After about 4 days, my baby was brought down from the ICU and my girl was taking of monitors. On day 6, we were allowed to go home. Everything's great now, but I cant get these images out of my head. The image of her bleeding out whilst my son struggled for air is something that currently haunts me.   


The problem is, I can feel my mental stability slipping away more and more as time increases. I am becoming increasingly angry and frustrated at the littlest of things, I feel sad 90% of the time without an actual reason as to why I am sad, and keep finding myself crying at night when im laid in bed. Not sure why, I just do.   


I mentioned this to my doctor as I thought I was maybe a little depressed but after I explained this he has suggested that its possible I have a slight variety of PTSD. I have counselling scheduled for a months time.   


I am basically looking for advice on the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Does this sound like PTSD?  
\- If so, is there anything I can do in the meantime to help?  
\- If not, is it depression? I just need to understand what is wrong with me right now. My relationship depends on it.

"First time posting here. Just detoxed 3 days ago I’m 24 and have been a social drinker since I was 21. At first I didn’t have a problem with it, but as the years went on, I realized all me and my friends ever do is drink together. Usually hard liquor and IPA’s and we would just pound it down. I started drinking a lot more when my girlfriend broke up with me. I started drinking by myself at night. Almost every night. I started to notice I had a problem when I would get sick when I DIDN’T drink anything for a day or 2. I got bad tremors, I would sweat, and eventually I would just start puking. I should have stopped at that stage but I went another 2 months of binge drinking just to not feel the withdrawals. Finally about 5 days ago I said enough was enough and told my friends and family that I’m an alcoholic and need help. I thought I could just fight through all the withdrawals on my own, but by day 3 I was puking multiple times an hour, completely drenched in sweat, and was shaking so bad I couldn’t even drink a glass of water without spilling everywhere. I ended up being hospitalized where they gave me a full detox, and put me on anti seizure pills and anti nausea pills. It feels good to be clean but right now I can’t sleep, am seeing hallucinations, and keep hearing this echo in my head that won’t go away. I’m also still kinda shaky.

"Met with a Psychiatrist for the first time Background, I was diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder 5 years ago. Have tried tons of meds, nothing worked, and the anxiety and panic has just gotten worse. 

About 6 months ago I began having auditory hallucinations (screaming, music, voices of family and friends) and some visual hallucinations (car accidents, spiders). And some delusions. It has just gotten progressively worse. 

I met with a psychiatrist for the first time 2 days ago and they said I have some signs of schizophrenia (plus family history of it), but a diagnosis takes longer because they want to be sure. She said the hallucinations and delusions could also be a symptom of an extreme case of anxiety and panic disorder. She put me on 2 new meds and we will be meeting every month to see if the hallucinations and panic get better, if not, then we will look into schizophrenia treatment. 

My question is, has anyone else had a similar experience? Perhaps anxiety lead to you having the common symptoms of schizophrenia, but not actually be a schizophrenic disorder?

TLDR: extreme anxiety for years, started having hallucinations and delusions, could this just be effects of extreme anxiety or a different diagnosis all together? And have any of you dealt with this?",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"I think my husband is an alcoholic, what more can I do? My (32F) husband (31M) and I have been married for 7 years, together for 11. Early in our relationship, we would have occasional nights of drinking, but it was never “heavy”. More like each of us drinking a tall IPA while watching a movie. It was always social, controlled, within boundaries. Never something that spilled into other areas of life and never something that affected our relationship. 

Something shifted a few years ago. I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out what could have caused it to no avail. But when he’d drink, it became that it was almost always to excess and he’d almost always get very sensitive, angry, quiet, unpredictable, etc. when he drank. He never saw anything wrong with his boundaries with drinking and his behavior while drunk. We started getting in fights while and after drinking, but it became a running “joke” among friends that when he drinks, his “dark passenger” joins us. Whenever I’d bring it up seriously concerned, he would always accuse me of overreacting. Especially because, hey, I drank too right? 

Fast forward—it’s been years of this cycle. We have a 3 year old daughter and a baby on the way. We’ve been in counseling for a few months. He drinks heavily nearly every time he drinks. His behavior is unpredictable. He thinks he’s “fine” as long as he can talk “normally” while drunk and doesn’t get angry or speak aggressively to me. He’s never been violent, just sensitive, speaks meanly and can be unpredictable. 

The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was after 2 weddings in a row earlier this year of him getting so drunk he had to leave early. The second wedding was the drunkest I’ve ever seen him and it happened to be days after I had a miscarriage. We didn’t talk for a few days after that episode and when we finally did, he apologized profusely, said things would change, and that it’s not right. I bet you know how the story goes. Things have not changed. I have story after story of him being the drunkest one in the room, hiding alcohol purchases from me, drinking in secret, feeling bad, starting over the next day, etc. 

Counseling was a last ditch effort for me. Maybe I waited til I was too close to the end of my rope to go. He was and is willing to go and the sessions have been productive. We went in with the intention to work out this issue with alcohol and how it affects our relationship. We have worked out some things that have helped us communicate much better in general, but ultimately the drinking has not changed. It’s still a problem every weekend and some week nights. 

Two weeks ago was our anniversary and, you guessed it, he got drunk to the point of not being able to speak even single words on the way home. He shuts off completely, usually passes out, or spends large chunks of time sitting and staring. Something broke in me when it happened on our anniversary. Got me thinking... Thousands of dollars and dozens of hours in counseling for it to be exactly the same, maybe even worse. He says all the right things in our counseling sessions, makes me have hope and trust, so when it happens it feels 100x more painful. I can’t continue like this. I can’t believe that this is my reality, this is not the man I married. I can’t even leave our daughter unattended with him because I have done so in the past and returned to him so drunk, he’s barely capable of taking care of himself let alone a young toddler. So I don’t leave our daughter with him anymore. Honestly, I’ve started to picture my life without him. But the main thing that holds me back from going down that road is that I can’t imagine leaving our children unattended with him for the days he has custody.

We haven’t spoken except out of necessity this week because he continued his pattern this weekend drinking himself to sleep 4 times in one day and drinking again too much the next day (in secret) hours after we had a conversation where he apologized for “making me feel alone and unsafe.” I’ve said it all 1000x and I don’t have any words left. I have nothing left. No more grace. No more patience. No more energy for it.

He is a good guy. He loves our family. When he’s sober he’s an amazing dad and husband. And I can’t picture life without him. When he’s drunk, I find myself googling how custody works when one parent has a closeted drinking problem. I am broken and completely at a loss of what to do next. We are still in counseling, but honestly until he’s ready to change, I know nothing will change. 

I am reasonably alone in carrying this. We haven’t told anyone about counseling or these ongoing issues. I’ve shared a little bit with my brother but I don’t want anyone to get too protective of me or have a bad view of my husband. One question is: would it be productive for me to talk to a close friend of his or maybe even his parents? They have observed this behavior and lightly expressed concern to me. His dad has talked to him, offered grace and help to him, but my husband said what he needed to say for the conversation to be over and the parents have not brought it up again. 

I know I can’t force him to change, but is there anyway I can encourage him to see the ways this is destroying our lives and that this is a serious matter with serious consequences? 

Is there anything I can say or do to break this pattern?

"Any help when it comes to identifying a relationship? (log post warning) Hey guys, I should probably introduce myself. I’m a 17 M who has high functioning autism. I have a main account, but I’ve use this account for posts that I don’t want people following my main to see.

I’m having a bit of trouble identifying my relationship with my best friend who also has high functioning autism. We’ve known each other for 10 years now and we haven’t had separate relationships when it comes to dating, but we still like each other more than best friends.


Here’s the problem though: She doesn’t like anything romantic, as well as not being touched. I get it to not being touched as I have a had a similar problem. When it comes to anything romantic though, it’s with a lot of typical romantic stuff as well.

She doesn’t like the handholding, the concept of a romantic date, and anything too “lovey dovey” in general. She also doesn’t like the terms “boyfriend” and “girlfriend” as she says it assumes that we would be in a romantic relationship, and she doesn’t like the romantic part. It makes her uncomfortable.

I’ve been okay with respecting her beliefs and not pressure her into anything, however my problem is that I want to be in a romantic relationship in general. I really like her and want to be a relationship with her but I have felt “trapped” to keep holding onto this feeling of wanting a relationship with her in case she changes her mind.

However, I’ve been noticing I’ve been a bit depressed more than usual when it comes to having a girlfriend. I want to be able to call her my girlfriend and do typical relationship stuff teenagers my age do. It’s especially hard considering that we are on the other side of the country in different states. I’m not saying that a long-distance relationship is impossible but I think it would be a challenge considering my wants as well.

I’ve been researching on my own about non-romantic terms for boyfriend/girlfriend but I can’t seem to find any (I guess there are none). I should probably talk to her but I’m afraid this will affect our relationship.

My question is if I should talk to her about my wants even if it does affect us? Are there non-romantic terms for boyfriend/girlfriend that we can use?

"Massive Blackout Haunting Me I am just going to throw it out there that I am not new to drinking. The only times I have ever blacked out for an entire night was when I was under the influence of alcohol AND drugs. Other than that it's just been ""brown"" outs or fuzziness here and there on occasion. 

The other night I blacked out HARD. There are a few things that I remember that are extremely, extremely vague. I only had four drinks and I was not on an empty stomach. The drinks were decently strong I will admit, but as I said this was not my first rodeo. I went from being kind of tipsy to completely obliterated and blacked out after one more drink. There was never a second where I felt like I was too drunk, and usually I start to feel sick before things even get fuzzy these days. I lost probably about 4 to 5 hours. No idea how I got home. Then there was a moment where it felt like I literally snapped out of it.

Does this sound normal for a blackout? I am asking because I am entertaining the idea that someone may have slipped something in my drink. I have been drugged before and it was a similar feeling, but I don't remember leaving my drink anywhere this time. Maybe I'm just getting old and can't handle alcohol the way I used to?!

"Tip: for those who cannot endure the side effects for medication used to treat schizophrenia or for those who simply dont see any effects. I have tried a wide array of antipsychotics, my issue with them was, that i got extremely sleepy and tired because of them and those that didnt make me tired didnt show any effects.

So they tried Concerta on me which surprisingly works very well for me! There arent a lot of studies im treating schizophrenia with Methylphenidate and all of the existing studies show mixed results. I recommend trying Concerta but consulting your psychiatrist first!

Example: this study where 8 schizophrenic patients were treated with concerta one suffered from pressor effect and had to leave the study 1 persons condition worsened but 3 saw some improvement![the study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1527231/)

"I forgot how utterly exhausting being triggered is. I’ve got my PTSD under control for the most part. I’m not super easily triggered. If I feel something coming on, I’m able to ground myself. 

I’ve been doing martial arts for a few years ago. I started by infrequently going to Aikido and Taihojutsu/Judo classes. I was doing them with a FWB, we’ll call Nick. When we stopped sleeping together, we remained close friends and classmates. When we started getting into ground grappling in Taihojutsu, I told Nick about how I was diagnosed with PTSD and I was afraid of getting triggered. He’s been extremely helpful, understanding, and cautious with me. 

A couple of months ago we took up BJJ and cardio kickboxing together. So now I go to BJJ 3-5 times a week and kickboxing 2-3 times a week, on top of weekly Aikido and infrequent Taihojutsu. 

I’ve been able to power through/ground myself from every trigger in BJJ. Even so much as working with a guy who looks EXACTLY like my abusive ex. It’s really uncanny. The only person in these classes who knows about my history is Nick. 

So yesterday, during the street self-defense portion of our kickboxing class, we worked on “What if somebody came up to you and tried to choke you from the front?” Immediately I was thrown off. Nick could tell I wasn’t okay. He kept asking if I was okay, if I wanted to do something else. I powered through thinking, “No I should learn this. So it never happens again.”

But still. Damn. I was shook. I was able to distract myself during BJJ. But I’m still so tired and foggy brained. ",ptsd,ptsd
"Having a bad week cause court and stuff Child sexual abuse survivor here, I’m having a rough go this week and could use like some tips to get through. It’s been over a year since I disclosed to the police, and it’s now going to a preliminary hearing on December 3rd. I’m really scared because I don’t know what to expect and I really don’t want the lawyers to ask me a bunch of questions that pick apart my life which I’m almost sure the they’ll do. I have also been doing a lot better with trying to block some memories out of my life (CBT therapy) but because I’ve had to rewatch my police statement and have had many meetings lately with the crown attorney, I can’t really do that very well. Everything’s just looping in my mind and I find myself staring at a wall or just pacing thinking and such. I also have my girlfriend, who is amazing and really cares about me, but who I feel like I’m hurting by burdening her with all the stress and anger and fear that I project through nightmares and flashbacks which have come back and just the constant anxiety. I feel really bad for her because I can tell she’s doing her best but I want her to still like me for who I am and not just see me as this abuse.  With school being busy and me having to work as well this is all just a really crazy stressful time, so again, any tips? ",ptsd,ptsd

"Help me get some clarity? (Concerned Parent) Hey there. I am writing this for my son and firstly if you take the time to read this, thank you. 

A year ago he was he had a psychotic brake and was put on a 5250 hold(14 days). 

Everything was fine he was put on Anti-Psychotics(he has been on Abilify, Handal or something like that and is now on Zyprexa). Recently he had issues and his psychiatrist called me saying he strongly advises me to schedule a 1 hour appointment as soon as he can come in. 

He has been acting really oddly: 

Has trouble remembering to take care of himself like eat, brush teeth, shave, ect. 

He speaks in wired ""rythem"" and sometimes it makes no sense to me. At dinner we were talking about something on the news and he said ""Yeah it is like when a cat jumps off a bride,but not the red kind the blue kind, with strings, man we have all changed just think of that"" 

He dosen't seem to have emotions correctly if that makes any sense like laughing at sad things or crying at funny things

So I am totally ignorant but I thought Schizophrenia meant like seeing shadow people, or being really paranoid? Also wouldn't all these pills he has been taking fix the problem?

"Idea: small support circles for check-ins throughout the day and week I think what I need more than traditional therapy is just to feel connected and emotionally supported. And I think we all know how to support each other and give kindness to each other out of mutual understanding.

Wouldn't it be great if we could form small groups, say groups of 4, that communicated regularly for daily and weekly check-ins for a fixed window of time, 3 months at a time with a group?

We could each promise to give one or two hours of our time per week to listen to someone by voice if someone needs it. And maybe we could choose our check-in partners/groups based on a micro-goal or micro-focus you'd like to get better at (for instance, waking up at a set time to give yourself enough time to get ready), and share strategies and motivation.",adhd,adhd

"Son diagnosed with ASD. Where to find specific advice? My son was diagnosed with ASD not too long ago at about 3 years old.

"Is this PTSD? Tw: Rape Tw: Rape

Someone close to me raped me as a child continually, forcing me to stay with him and threatening to cut off financial support to my family if I didn’t stay with him.

I get very anxious whenever I see strangers, men, in public whilst alone. My heart starts to speed up and I have the urge to get away from them as quickly as possible.

"My personal experience with many autistic guys, please for the love of god stop worshipping women. Have some respect for yourselves. You are just as valuable if not more valuable! I am going to anger quite a lot of people by writing this post. So be it, can't do anything about it.  
This post is only aimed towards a group of autistic guys on here that seriously grinds my gears.  


**Stop worshipping women like they are some holy creature that can't do any wrong, including autistic women.**  


Many males on here are some serious white knights. You think women are perfect beings and that sex is the ultimate goal of life. I can understand that being alone and all those raging hormones make you crave the magick cave. But for the love of god please contain it and try to act rationally! There is a nice cute looking autistic girl on here, and you flock to her like a pack of wolves onto a lone sheep. She is not special guys, just an ordinary human but with boobs and other genitals...  


Relationships really aren't that special, even for normal people not on the spectrum. Dating in todays world infested with feminism and fat acceptance is often absolutely not worth it! Many females have enormous egos that are big enough to fill the void of space. Look at Japans herbivore men, the declining birth rate, marriage companies dying, marriage rates plummeting, infidelity of female partners rising.   


Slowly men are realizing the game is not worth the effort. Groups like MGTOW are growing in numbers extremely quickly. Many of these guys are normal everyday people, and it doesn't matter if you have autism or not. Females expect to be treated special and you have to pander to there whims and every single need. Very often females will discard you just for being autistic, for not looking hot enough, for not being rich enough, no friends or social status. See the many studies performed on this topic by datingsites.  


I have seen how my best friend, who is autistic aswell, got destroyed and used by women. They used him as an emotional tampon and threw him away after they had used him. She did horrible stuff to him, gossiping behind his back, telling lies about him, putting his friends against him, berating and destroying his image. I told him many times that he should stop clinging to girls and try to distance himself from loving her to much. Yet every time it ends the same, they end up using him and trying to hurt him. He eventually learned that women in todays society can be toxic as hell.   


Just because a girl is autistic, does not mean she is any different. Keep that in mind! In my life I have met many autistic girls that would make a hooker blush. Some of these girls would have a new partner every day and cheat around like it's natural. Most where very rude and had no perception of decency or loyalty. They blame everyone else for not trusting or liking them and completely forget about any self-improvement or respect. Autism is not an excuse to justify being a massive slut and cheating... Yes, you have problems, but: that does not mean you should treat your fellow humans like trash.   
   
Sex is really not that great guys. If you really want it that bad, go pay yourself a hooker. After that experience you will understand that it was not like you imagined it to be. Without connection or true love sex will feel just like masturbation on yourself but worse. Stop putting effort into females and dating, just be yourself. Focus on your hobbies and what makes you happy. If a girl really likes you, she will take you for whom you are. Don't try to act like someone you are not just for 15 minutes of pleasure.   


Improve yourself, invest times in hobbies and loved ones, treat the ones you care about with respect. But DO NOT give respect to someone just because she has this magick cave in her pants. Respect is to be earned not to be given. And if you treat people well and are a good person, you have earned respect, don't forget that. You are to be treated with respect and decency by these women.  


Take care of yourselves guys. Have fun and enjoy life. Do what makes you happy. Treat these women like you would treat your male friends. They are no different, ordinary humans like the rest of us.

"Can anti-social personality disorder be comorbid with autism? I often hear misconceptions and stereotypes about the autistic spectrum. One popular misconception is that we are cold, calculating androids who don't feel anything and are basically sociopaths.

Sociopathy isn't even a diagnosis anymore (The correct term is Anti-social Personality Disorder)and on top of that, people on the spectrum have difficulties expressing their feelings outwardly to others.

But I'm wondering if it's possible for an autistic person to actually have ASPD. Is it possible or are the two inherently different to the point they can't be comorbid?

"Help for my friend. One of my best friends has schizophrenia.  The past several years when he has had symptoms he would check with me to make sure they're not real. Up until now hes been able to see real from fake. This past week he has been going downhill. It culminated to yesterday morning when I drove him to the hospital to be admitted. He left and came home late last night ama (against medical advice). Around 330-400am he still hadnt slept and was taking things apart in the house looking for cameras. I tried talking to him like I normally do, to help him and let him know what sounds were real. He had a glazed over look in his eyes and said he would stop after he was done demolishing the house looking for cameras. He has been downstairs with his significant other since then and haven't heard anything.  What (if anything) can I do to help him? I dont want to fall back asleep in case he does something serious, but I dont know how long it's going to last. He has medication to take as needed, and he gets shots every couple of months or so to help him. I guess he just got a shot recently and isn't able to get another one for awhile. I'm really scared for him, and am sad he is going through this. I cant imagine what it all feels like and I know he is inside, behind all the voices. My heart is breaking because I cant fix him (that's my prob though, not his). I guess I just want to know how to decide to call for help for him. Of course I know to call if he is showing signs of hurting himself or others. I just dont know if I should monitor him and let him safely check things, or call his dr. I'm also afraid if I call his dr and he finds out that he wont trust me anymore.

"NSFW no one has to read this i just really feel like venting Trigger warning: sexual assault

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an absolute mess of a human and trying really hard to be okay, but a bit over a week ago I was watching a TV show with a boy I'm seeing where a girl was being raped and the rapist whispers 'shhhh' over and over. I tried to block my ears and i had my eyes closed, but the scene sprung up out of nowhere so i saw about 2 seconds of it.   


Ever since then I've been a mess. I've barely been able to shower, haven't been able to clean, haven't been able to eat, I didn't sleep properly for a few days (kept waking up every half hour). A couple of nights ago half way through sex I had a flashback and I don't remember anything after that, but apparently I was crying a lot and completely non verbal for a while. I 'completely shut down' and he had to really try to get any words out of me, apparently. the next morning i had false awakenings where i was just lying in bed being spooned, then his hand comes and grabs my mouth and shoves me into the bed. i woke up in a panic and realised he was just cuddling me so i must be dreaming, but other than that i absolutely can't distinguish what i dreamt from reality. I realise i've had the same thing before - dreams where 'arms', sometimes someones, sometimes invisible arms, grab my mouth and shove me into the bed.   


I have PTSD but I don't actually know what the cause is. I can make a very good guess, but I just have symptoms and learning my triggers, with no actual solid memories. apparently once I told a friend what i thought happened while i was throwing up and crying and screaming (first ever flashback episode), but i don't have any memory of even doing that.   


There was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't. He says it never happened. Now with this false awakening, I'm worried that I've thought ill of him when it actually was just all in my head. What if it was just a false awakening.   


I haven't been able to stop crying. i have this constant feeling of terror. And i have no one around me to help. because of my ptsd i push everyone away one way or another. when something triggers me like this i can end up completely non functional. i just want a normal fucking life and a normal brain and a boyfriend. i feel like i'm never going to be able to have any of that because of what some fucking cunt decided to do to a little kid.",ptsd,ptsd

"ADHD and University I'm writing this whilst feeling ridiculously stressed about my upcoming dissertation hand-in this Friday so I apologise if I exaggerate anything too much. I'm less than two months away from finishing my degree and am looking forward to finally being done but overall I feel like the experience has completely shattered the little self esteem that I had beforehand.

I've been in therapy for 2 months but have not been diagnosed with anything, yet. 

I've been depressed and socially withdrawn for a long time. Recently some more serious symptoms have shown up. I constantly feel like I'm being followed or watched by a sinister force. It makes me have intrusive thoughts and images in my head. Also mild visual hallucinations. 

It starts with a sense of doom. I could almost be sure that my house is going to explode, or some creature is going to come out of hiding and charge at me and eat my face off. I get paranoid, always scanning my surroundings wide eyed. I see shadow beings in my periphery and around corners. Faces or creatures on everday items as if every object in the room is looking at me. The walls and carpet breathing and flowing. The worst part is the depictions of monsters and dead bodies projected into my mind. It feels like some force is planting the images in my head. There's no way my mind could conjure up such horrifying images so vividly by itself. When this happens it overwhelms me and I have to run and hide.

"Lost my mom to a relapse Three years ago my mom nearly drank herself to death. This woman with a masters degree, who taught children all over the world and was good at everything she put her mind to, couldn’t stop drinking. She went through multiple medically induced detoxes and eventually ended up in a coma before being released to the psych ward and ultimately admitted to a locked nursing home for 8 months. She was 60 at the time. She was diagnosed with cirrhosis and a slew of other health issues that would never go away. And she stopped drinking. For three years I had my mother back, albeit she needed a lot of support. She was there though. She answered my calls and listened to me. 

I was grateful to have my mom back. Last weekend I took her camping for the first time in our lives. We sat under the stars around a fire and talked. It was beautiful. She told me that she had tried having a drink, because, “she needed to know for herself that she couldn’t do it.” She said it was as just one, then she said it was a few. I had just been reading about Relapse Prevention (Marlatt, UW) for my own work in addiction (4 years sober) and was supportive of her, so as not to shame her. We talked about the most common triggers and that a lapse doesn’t always mean relapse. Things seemed ok. She said she was done and it was over. 

Yesterday she was found dead in her apartment. I’m completely lost. I wish I would have done more to get her help. My heart is broken. I’m heading across state to clean out her apartment this morning. Just a reminder that this disease kills and is progressive. My mom used to scoff at anyone drinking cheap wine and ended up not being able to get off the couch surrounded by cans of steel reserve. Take care of yourself to get support and ask for help if you are triggered or in a high risk situation. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP. Pick up the phone.

The argument was trivial and motivated mostly by stress, but was blown out of proportion by a huge meltdown on my part. I'm worried my dad's partner will never accept me as their family now that they've seen this side of me. My confusion leads me to ask what is the best way to approach anger in the future?

"(TW) I feel more productive when I don’t eat. I think this might be triggering for others as I can feel my head is in such a dark place and I’m saying such negative things and I’m sorry about that. 


I really feel like I do more during the day when I don’t eat. Like I’ll clean, tick things off my to-do list etc when I know my stomach is empty. 


I went out with my friends today and I ate and later I got a drink but I wanted to cry on the way home because I felt so bad for eating and I felt so disgusting. I wanna cry now tbh because I hate that I’ve eaten. The scale says I’ve lost weight but I just see myself getting fatter,  I can’t comprehend that I’ve lost weight it doesn’t make sense to me. I can fit into a UK size 10 but I think I looked like an over-stuffed sausage and just in general quite disgusting. I can’t even motivate myself to get up and shower or get changed now that I’m home.

"If justice was real. (TW: violent thoughts?) I wish he could properly be punished for what he did to me. I'm tired of paying the punishment for his crime for him.

 I'm tired of the nightmares I have of him, of freezing up when I remember how he used to look or sound or feel or smell. I'm so sick of feeling severely physically ill every day because of all this. I've had to take a lot of time off from work, spend time and money on treatment, deal with debilitating physical and emotional pain from what he's done to me. On the worst days, I'm bed ridden, I've lost weight because eating is hard on a lot of days. He fueled an eating disorder that I'm trying to recover from and it makes my lack of appetite from this stress even more complicated to deal with. 

It's unfair. I can't report him to the law, the police wouldn't be able to do anything. 

But I hope he's still truck driving. I hope when he steps on a truck one day, he gets into a one vehicle accident and no one else is harmed but him. I wish he could burn alive, trapped inside his truck and have a long, painful, horrible and awful death.

 Would it fix any of this? No. I'd still be suffering, and he still would have abused me and threw a giant wrench into my entire life. But right now he's happy and he has a bunch of friends and he gets to go have fun everyday. I'm scared of every new person that comes along because what if they're like him? I've cut contact and blocked him everywhere, but what if he still finds a way back? I can't deal with people touching me anymore. Sometimes I'll have someone at work touch me and each time it makes me feel physically sick. 

He's done all of this to me, and I'm enraged that he has gotten away with this unpunished. Everyday I find myself hoping that I'll hear that something bad has happened to him and that it will maybe be enough to make up for what he's done. 

But I don't think he'll ever have to pay for any of this. But that I will continue to do so. And it tears me apart to even think about.",ptsd,ptsd
"How do I support my brother during recovery? Hello, first time poster. I’m sure some iteration of this question gets asked often, but here goes. My brother will be coming out of rehabilitation in just a few days. This was a huge step in the right direction for him and our family could not be prouder or happier for him. We all are looking for the best ways to support him and make his continued recovery easier. But no one quite knows how best to handle this? Drinking is a big part of most of our family gatherings. No one wants to put him in an uncomfortable position by exposing him to this early after rehab. On the other hand we don’t want him to feel like he’s burdened his family into having to change their habits around him. Before going into rehab he had a lot of unrealistic fears about being abandoned by his family or friends because he’d be sober.

"Mentioning Previous Medication Use to Psychologist? Hi, I'm in the middle of being assessed for ADHD and I'm kind of nervous because I worry what will happen to me academically if I'm not able to be diagnosed. I'm in university right now and while I've always had trouble focusing/organizing workspaces/keeping thoughts linear it's become harder and harder to perform in school.


To get to the point of my post, what finally prompted me to seek out a diagnosis was when a friend gave me one of their Ritalin. It was wild, the world seemed to ""slow down"" (not literally, but my thoughts became more settled and linear and I didn't have the urge to do stuff like get up and pace or constantly stop doing work to mess with something, etc.). I told her about that and she said that's what it's like for her too, so this is what finally sort of mentally confirmed it to myself that I have ADHD.


Now that I'm seeing a psychologist and am being assessed I'm wondering if I should mention that to her, obviously I think that would be a clue that there is a problem but I'm worried that if I say that I'll be viewed as a liar who's now just trying to get a prescription to abuse it or something. It doesn't help that my mother has kind of been pushing that I don't have it (since I rely on her to give an account of my childhood symptoms) because she's afraid of me taking ADHD meds.


TL;DR Should I tell psychologist I've used Ritalin once before and it made me feel ""normal""",adhd,adhd

"My stepson has the king of all meltdowns and I don’t know what to do now. This morning My 8-year-old stepson had one of the worst meltdowns I have ever seen from him.   He was playing a video game before school and he had 30 minutes left to play.  I told him every 10 minutes how much longer he had so it wouldn’t be a surprise to him when I told him that we needed to leave.  He was near the end of a chapter in the game when we needed to leave and he lost it when I told him to save and grab his bag.  Up to this point, I was comfortable navigating the situation.  We got him in the car with his 8-month-old baby brother and in his tirade he hit the baby on purpose (in his meltdowns he retains this desire to hurt the people who made him mad).  We immediately got the crying baby out of the car, told his teacher that my stepson couldn’t go to school today, and dropped him off with some relatives.  

I don’t know what to do at this point.  His meltdown ended and he apologized to the baby and to us but now I feel like it is only a matter of time before he hits the baby again in a fit.

"Calming my emotions/just diagnosed Hello everyone, it's great to see that there's such a community of people with add/ADHD. 

I'm suffering from depression, for most parts of my life  I had ups and downs, first and only suicide attempt when I was 19. I thought I might have borderline personality and struggled with almost every aspect of my life. No friends except one person, being misunderstood all the time, being lonely, totally out place, I felt dumb and not adjusted to this world.

I managed to finish primary and secondary education without major trouble except really bad grades (apart from languages and biology), I used to do art and wanted to be a psychiatrist and ended up on philosophy degree - which was an extremely big change in my life. I could truly experience the ability to hyperfocus while learning and doing assignments for the very first time in my life. I did struggle when something was boring, but I ended up as being the best one on my year. 

 After a while depression sucked me from the inside, I gave up and started depression meds such as SSRI, they made me feel even worse. I decided to  see a psychiatrist privately and he
suggested ADD, I'm 32 and once I started recalling every aspect of my life that could lead me to be depressed I included being totally unaware of what teachers told me, couldn't learn things that bored me, had trouble focusing, being ""absent minded"", left jobs and courses whenever felt like they don't stimulate me anymore... 

Problems in relationships, always wanting something that doesn't exist. I killed my first serious relationship myself, the other one with an abusive partner felt almost like atonement.. but I freed myself from him. I have a 3 year old daughter and I struggle with parenting at times. 

This diagnosis made me finally understand what's going on with me. I'm happy and excited, exploring all resources, waiting for CBT as well. I'm on methylphenidate and mirtazapine for depression and anxiety.. 

What I came across yesterday was an article about how people with ADD experience rejection. The painful feeling in the area just above my belly, extremely strong emotions and sadness. 

I'm nearly losing my job right now (I will probably go on a little hiatus to sort myself as I felt like leaving this job anyway, applying for uni) because of huge crying outbursts while supporting people with disabilities. I was sent home several times. I have been rejected recently, after 2 years of nice numbness, by a lover and then by a friend he became.. all my fault, my impulsivity in relationships (never agressive, but I got angry at him for being abusive toward his partner who has ADD as well)..

 I sometimes feel so overwhelmed by my emotions. Been trying mindfulness (my psychiatrist is an angel, he suggested mindfulness and shows me how to do the excercises, he's not the type who just prescribes meds). Some friends still don't quite understand what's going on with me. I'm trying to accept my emotions but there are simply times when they kill me, I also gave up on diazepam recently, so no emergency pills for me. Do you also have this problem? How do you cope? Any other tips than mindfulness and CBT which I'm waiting for? All best everyone",adhd,adhd

"How to help mother with PTSD who is constantly reacting to things and has zero composure to control her emotions? To start, my mum clearly has a undiagnosed Anxiety disorder like OCD and GAD, i know as i have them two which are treated. All she does is worry excessively, and when i ask her to describe her feelings, she always speaks fast and says she is anxious. All the damn time, she's been abused all her life be it from her dad, and previous partners. Her behaviors almost cross into the territory of a personality disorder like BPD/ASPD, although she has a lot of empathy and is affected by a lot of emotion to things out of her control and for other people. But yes, she is generally a toxic person, she seems to be as provocative as the other person in arguments.

It's causing me a lot of stress because we have a neighbor who is causing public nuisance, and although that nuisance affects me, what affects me is my mothers response to the nuisance. We are awaiting the verdict of a landlord to see if those tenants will be evicted.

you see she had been in a relationship with someone who had NPD so she has lots of traumas from it, and this tenant who is 12 that is causing the nuisance has the exact same traits as her ex.

All day today she has been telling me ''Will the tenant keep provoking me'', and you can clearly see that she is extremely affected by this. I think the nuisance does need to stop and it affects me, but the police cannot do virtually anything as he isn't really committing a crime and is 12, it annoys me every bit as it annoys her but the difference is i try put headphones in and ignore it, my mother on the other hand reacts and in retrospect just causes more of the trouble, practically giving the person fuel.",ptsd,ptsd

A few times she has fallen and hurt herself- bruised head, sore arm etc. One time she could not get up and my father - who is older - could not pick her up. Her mother (my grandmother) was an alcoholic as well. So this is very scary. 

A few months ago I told my mom that I was concerned and asked her why she was drinking more. She said she didn't know. I told her that if she kept drinking too much around friends, they won't want to come over for dinner anymore. (She told me she had gotten drunk when her friend came over for dinner. She fell that night too and they all helped pick her up).

However, these days I feel she is drinking even more than before. They live far away in the winter so I cannot physically see the situation myself. But I often know she's drinking bc she calls me drunk. I considered our prior chat a ""light talk"". I think i need to say or do something again.  

What should I do? Should I specifically ask her if she will stop drinking? Should I ask her to go to AA? Should I threaten to tell people she knows that she has a drinking problem?

"Taking Atomoxetine / Saterra with Diazepam? Has anyone had experience taking these two drugs in the same day, or knows how they would interact? I changed from ritalin/concerta to the non-stimulant treatment (atomoxetine) to help reduce anxiety. I am still experiencing it however (I suffered from this before starting ritalin anyway). I have only been on atomoxetine for about a week but read that it can take a few weeks to feel the effect from it (as opposed to ritalin which is pretty much instant). I'm finding myself taking the occasional valium to help with the anxiety I still have, but I'm worried about prolonging the atomoxetine getting into my system to actually experience what it's like and if it's the right treatment for me. I'm also wondering if the atomoxetine is perhaps still the cause of my anxiety, I still experienced it during the week or so after I stopped concerta and wasn't on anything, and I assumed that it would have been out of my system by then.",adhd,adhd

It’s a lot more of a rant than anything- just venting because I can’t unload anywhere else 

I haven’t been restricting very long. It’s a relapse.. i had been maintaining a certain weight since last year but gained 15lbs from carelessness. Something triggered me full stop back into restricting and I can’t stop.

A few crappy comments really turned my head in. I’ve been eating under 200cals for a while and exercising as much as I can take. Most days I wait 24hrs and eat a single egg. Yesterday I messed up and ate a baked chicken wing a few hours after my egg. Went and ran immediately to attempt to counteract the calories.

I’ve found even in my dreams I can’t eat. I have had dreams the last 3 nights of going in my fridge, picking up something (little Debbie zebra cake, leftover fajitas, bacon) and I always put it back. I guilt and berate myself even in my dreams.

Back when I was dieting the “healthy way” I’d dream of food but I’d be binging and enjoying it the entire dream. I’d wake up satisfied. Now I wake up craving food and feeling weak and bad about myself because I even think about eating

"14 Years old, probably have some form of ADHD, no idea what to do. I've noticed recently (especially in school) that when a lesson gets too boring i start concentrating on other things, such as a bird outside of the classroom, even if i was actively listening to what someone was saying just a few seconds ago. 

I've noticed that when im bored i feel like crap and move my legs a lot, even stand up to get something to blow my nose with (even if i don't have to, just to get some kind of movement).

I've noticed that at home when i play games and there's longer cutscenes in them that i just get bored and quit the game/skip the cutscene even if it was important.

I also have a ""problem"" with reading Novels and whatnot. I have a tendency of just skipping parts of the pages or ""flying over them"" with my eyes. (Not sure how to explain this but i hope anyone who reads this understands what i mean by that)

So i took a couple of tests online and answered truthfully. The results mostly said something like ""You *probably* have ADHD"" or ""Probably not"".

After informing myself a little bit more i saw that you can treat ADHD, but it needs to be diagnosed by a professional first.

Afaik my parents have no clue about this and neither does anyone else that i know, so im not really sure how im supposed to get it diagnosed or tested.

The worst part about all of this is WANTING to move around rapidly, to get some adrenaline, but having to just supress it and sit still/stand still so you look like a normal person.

My question would be: Is there a way to get a *real* diagnosis without my parents finding out/knowing?

"I’m losing everyone in my life because of alcohol I’m currently 19 years old, and I started drinking in high school when I was 17. Throughout high school I made a lot of really good friends: I had my main group of best friends, which is made up of a few guys, and we usually hung out with a few other people all the time, who I considered my close friends. As I went into university, I began to drink a lot more. Alcohol was available more often and I didn’t live with my parents, which meant I had more freedom. Coming back to my hometown during the first summer back from university, I began drinking till I basically blacked out every time. My friends and I began hanging out with other people from my high school that I didn’t really talk to before, so at this point I had the most friends I’ve ever had in my life. By the end of the summer, however, everything began to fall apart. This new group of people constantly told my other friends that I was pretty annoying while drunk, but I didn’t want to admit it. I thought they were probably just being mean because we were never really friends in high school. As my second year of university began, my alcohol problem just got worse. I began drinking in larger quantities, mostly because everyone else did it too. Even my close friends always talked about their “drunk adventures” and “how much fun they always had while drunk”. Most of the time I just went with it because I thought I wanted to have fun and I needed to get completely drunk to do so. Then, as I came back to my hometown during the summer from my second year, I noticed some of my close friends (but not my best friends) were being a bit distant. At this point, I think I knew that it was my alcohol problem pushing them away, but I kept telling myself that they were probably just exaggerating. They eventually started hanging out without me, and eventually stopped talking to me. Then, a couple of weekends ago, I went out to a club with two of my best friends (at this point, the only ones who probably still invite me to go out and hang out and stuff). As per usual, I got really drunk but I really lost it and ended up punching my best friend. Him and my other friend left because they were upset, and I ended up outside the club, drunk and alone, ready to pass out any minute. I live fairly close to the club so I walked home, and as I got home I had the urge to throw up. Once I got to the bathroom, I just vomited all over the toilet, waking up my mom and my dad. The next day, I’ll never forget the look on my mom’s face. She was clearly upset, but most of all she was concerned about me. It just hit me at that point and I felt horrible. There was not a single person left that I hadn’t made angry or concerned in my hometown, including my own parents. Then, I swore that I’d never get drunk again in my life. I wish it hadn’t gotten to this point, and I’m really sad that it took for all my friends to abandon me to realize that alcohol was destroying my life. Now, I apologized to my best friends and they accepted my apology, but everyone else has stopped talking to me, and when my friends are invited somewhere by my old friends, I’m usually not invited anymore. I guess I really brought this upon myself and now I have to face the consequences alone. And I know I might fail and get drunk sometime, but I’ll never forget this feeling of loneliness and emptiness. I will use it as fuel to always get up and try no matter what.

"Boyfriend is probably using me It’s wonderful being unable to trust my inner “instinct”, since my senses have been heightened and perverted by this disease. 

Can I trust my own judgement on this? 

He is often distant, and has called me “the most negative person [he’s] ever met”, “difficult”, “volatile”, “a burden”, “stressful”, amongst other things. He has admitted to not being as attracted to me, as I’ve gained weight. He told me this the night I got back after being in my home state to be with my family after witnessing my grandmother die in hospital. 

Since then, he has pendulum swung between being supportive and loving, to informing me of all the ways I make his life so much harder. 

I pay half the rent, but the majority of the groceries, pay the water bill, half the energy bill, and though he does pay the internet, I also am the only one with a car and license, so I’m the only one driving around for everything. 

He has said nobody has ever helped him in life, so I looked at him hurt as I do a lot to help hI’m, so he reluctantly admitted I had “helped him a bit”, so I offered “I guess I’m more of a burden then a help.” 

“Hm.” Was my only reply. He wouldn’t look at me.

Ashwagandha and rhodiola: very potent and powerful adaptogens, helps with more things than I can sit and list but it helps your body adapt and reach homeostasis. Ashwagandha outperforms every antidepressant on the market in clinical trials. 

Lions mane mushrooms: helps repair nerves and the brain

Betel nut: is a strong natural antipsychotic and brings clarity to the head. Its believed it can cause cancer though and is extremely addictive and stains your teeth.

Kratom: using on days that you cant get out of bed, or when you're tapering off medication, it can enrich your life massively. Also highly addictive so use sparingly. 

Salvia Divinorum: simultaneously the most dangerous and the safest herb on this list. While it has nothing but good benefits for your physiological body, it's the most potent natural hallucinogen on the planet. Most find it absolutely terrifying. With that being said, the way in which it works affects your dopamine levels, and help help to regulate them far after using it. Salvia has changed my life entirely, I no longer need any medication because of it and it has helped my brain go down an average of 5.5 standard deviations in addition to neurofeedback.

I've racked up a fair amount of credit card debt paying for things after I pay for alcohol with my real money.

My kids have never known me sober. My wife is equally as drunk as me. 

My wife and I fight sometimes after the kids are in bed. I forget why for a couple days until I remember. Then it's usually her fault. (Not being cocky there. She always admits guilt)

I truly believe we are drunk undetected aside from the apparent multiple cases of liquor I bring home that the neighbours see me carry in every day.

I dont give a fuck about what people think. I only worry about my kids.

I'm as drunk as I usually get. And I cant remember what point I was trying to get across but it's pretty clear that I'm worried about my kids.

"I turned into an aggressive drinker after getting beat up pretty badly. What do to? So, I just turned 31 last month. I'm not exactly an alcoholic but I like to drink now and then. I don't crave alcohol tho. 

Backstory is, October last year, on a Friday after getting outta work I decided to grab some drinks with a friend. Everything was normal, drinking only beer. So we went to another bar and I drank some hard licor (moonshine). Next thing I know is all hell broke lose. I don't remember much, just some girls waking me up on a sideway, they were calling an ambulance. I tried to stood up and said ""Nah there's no need"", and after that I just remember waking up in the hospital.

2 broken ribs, swollen face, a bit of my ear ripped off. I never went through something like that. Hell, I didn't even had a street fight in 15 years.

Apparently I picked up a fight with 4 or 5 homeless / drug users. 

But eventually I got better. So after 2 months I decided to go out with some friends, and it was good. I woke up in my bed, in one piece, nothing was stolen. So I text a friend to see if I did something wrong. I did. Suddenly I tried to pick a fight with some bad hombres. A friend tackled me and they called an Uber to get me out. 

And it happened a third time at a BBC, same history, but this time I was mad at my own friends. 

This has been a disgrace. I don't understand. I am not a violent person, I'm always extremely calm and kind of stoic.  I never picked up fights, never dissed anyone and all of a sudden this starts to happen.

Maybe it's some kind of PTSD? 

I noticed that this only happens if I mix drinks. 

It's like everything is normal and then boom, something in my brain turns off. Maybe suicidal tendencies? 

I know I may sound like a scumbag, but if someone went through something like this, please share.

I don't know what to do. Not drinking seems the obviously answer. But I would like to be able to drink some and not get killed. Like overcoming a fear.

"Searched all over, couldn't find a good answer: Is the process at all different from the standard one for getting something like concerta as an adult if I was prescribed it as a teenager? When I was a teenager I was diagnosed with ADHD and given concerta to treat it. The effects were generally positive, but I eventually ceased taking it. These days I'm EXTREMELY busy with a highly focus demanding job and feel a lot of those similar symptoms of mentally running through mud and basically shutting down after a certain point. If this diagnosis and prescription history is documented in my medical history (and I'm assuming it would be) is the process for getting on it again now just a matter of going to my GP and getting the prescription renewed or would I typically have to go see a specialist again to get re-diagnosed?

"Triggered and unmedicated I stopped my medication cycle after roughly 5 consistent years of combined medication/CBT/EMDR treatment; I stopped due to financial inability and a psychiatrist that wouldn't listen to me, who decided to treat me for Bipolar 2 (that she diagnosed) instead of PTSD (diagnosed 5 years ago). 
I've been struggling with my anxiety and depressive symptoms, but I've been able to use the tools developed in CBT and EMDR treatment to manage, for the most part. Weed helps too.

The other morning I took the bus to work. As a man got off, I smelled it. It was his cologne. And I was right back there. My blood ran cold, I felt the tactile sensations of the alley where I was assaulted; I couldn't breathe, feeling the weight if my attacker's body again. When I got to my workplace I ran to the bathroom, vomited violently, and spent the rest of the day shaky, jumpy, and sobbing at random.

"Reaching out to a struggling employee? My family runs some restaurants and we have an employee whose family works with us. One of them has struggled with alcohol for years. She has been sober for 8 months but started drinking yesterday. She has called in, but i had a feeling of what happened.

From what her husband us saying, it sounds like she was white knuckling it and in the past few weeks got stressed out. She has requested off for next month for a couple to visit her parents who she hadnt seen in 8 years. Her family was looking forward to seeing her sober. 

Lately she has been sober (according to her husband, who has worked with us for decades) for 8 months but yesterday started drinking again. 

I am not very close to their family outside of work, but ww have worked together for most of my life and i hate to see her go back down this path.

"I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to have PTSD. I've been reading all of your posts for a while and the traumatic experiences you've all suffered are beyond words. I'm proud of the people who have opened up and helped themselves and I'm saddened for those who are struggling every day. I love everyone here equally, and I'm here if anyone needs to talk. Just know that. I'm working up the courage to even actually post this.   


I've been hurting a lot lately but I don't think I should even be allowed to say I have PTSD. My experience is so stupid in comparison to all the shit you've all had to deal with. I need to write it out because it's been a year since it happened and I don't know where else to talk about it. I don't want to talk to my family and I don't want to talk about it out loud. It's getting worse. But I feel so stupid and so weak. I've looked through all the tips and tricks, I've tried to bring up the courage to go back to therapy - I just can't. Not yet. I don't have the income for it yet.  


So I'm going to write it out here and if you want to ignore it, that's fine. I'm okay with that. I need to put it out there somewhere so I can go to work today and be a functioning adult. It's taken me two hours a lot of panic attacks to write this but here it is.   


Last year someone set my porch on fire.   


My alarms didn't work and if my wife hadn't been next to me, I wouldn't have woken up in time to save the house. I remember the shattering of the window above our front door. I remember calling 911 in a panic, unable to tell if we could get outside. I remember it being 2 am and feeling like I was going to die and regretting so much of my life. I remember running downstairs and searching for my cats, not being able to find them, being screamed at by the emergency operator to get outside through the back. There were people standing across the street before the fire trucks even came, watching us and talking to each other.   


I called my landlord who rushed over, I remember her being pissed that the alarms weren't working but hugging me anyway. The firemen put out the fire before it damaged more than the front room. They spoke to her. I remember her coming back over and yelling at us for 'smoking cigarettes' and that we 'caused the fire and my insurance rates are going to go up'.   


We don't smoke.  


Everyone left after they checked the house. I remember walking back in, covered in soot, picking up the pieces of glass that had burned into the hardwood floors. I remember sweeping up the ash, the smell of fire and smoke deep in my nostrils. I remember being unable to breathe for weeks afterward. I remember calling my boss and telling him I couldn't work the next day. I remember feeling like my neighbors were out to kill me.   


I believe it was a hate crime. Our car had gotten broken into, our porch furniture had been stolen, people were dumping trash in our yard, and they made snide comments when they saw us. We were the only lesbians in that area. I can't prove that, though. The insurance adjusters ruled it an accident, my landlord found a candle melted into the remains of our porch, and said she believes we lit the candle and then went to bed. I know we would never do that.  


We moved out about three months ago and while I feel safer, I don't feel safe. I've been having nightmares, I've been reliving moments I wish I could forget. I had to quit my kitchen job because the smell of smoke and seeing fire drives me into a panic. Last night I could have sworn I saw smoke in my apartment and it sent me into a sobbing fetal position. There was nothing there. There's never anything there. I've woken up to a crash that's in my head, I've woken up with the feeling of soot under my feet when I'm perfectly clean. I'm so tired but I can't seem to get any sleep.  


I just feel like it wasn't that bad. My brain is overreacting to something that could have been put out with three buckets of water. My whole mental stability is being pressured over a fire and why? Because it may have been malicious? Because someone might have wanted to scare us? I hate that it worked. I hate that the person who did this is never going to be punished. But why is my life becoming so fucked up over something that was not that bad? Why.   


It's coming up on the one-year anniversary and I'm feeling worse than I did after it first happened. I just need to get it off my chest. I'm sorry for the long-winded writing. I'm sorry for even posting on this sub but I don't know where else to turn.

"I need help talking to an autistic roommate about health. Ok so I have an autistic roomate mid 20s. He is increasingly morbidly obese and I think pre diabetic. I'm not positive about the prediabetes but he has the symptomes, most notably the neck and joint rashes, he needs to see a doctor and check. He actually has active weekends (larping), but he eats by my estimation 6-8 thousand calories a day when i try and track it. The raw sugar intake is an issue in itself, he is going through a 1lb bag of sugar ~weekly. He heaps it in every drink even if it is already something high in sugar like pop. 6-8 continuous hours a day (sans bio breaks) at the kitchen table every day, youtubing, scripting(stimming)? and intermittently eating/drinking, is the general behaviour.

My SO tried to talk to him about it once and he raged (meltdown?) to the point she cried (you're not my mom etc), I still feel like I should try myself because it is honestly just watching someone kill themselves and you could say it is not my business, but if I don't try there is nobody else and it kinda isn't his fault either. *From my google fu obesity is supposed to be an autism linked problem because of difficulty communicating and the impulse/sensory stuff, but the strategies I found always assume you`re a parent or guardian.

Ok so last year I was involved in a collision (minor, no injuries) and received a DUI for which I have since been convicted. I'm in recovery, it was a terrible relapse, but now I'm back on the wagon with several months sober.

I originally talked to my insurance company while I was still being charged with the DUI and I did tell them over the phone that I had been involved in an accident and that liquor was involved and I was being charged with a DUI.

Then my insurance renewal papers come in the mail and I notice it has barely gone up (about a month ago, after I had already been convicted for a few months). It seems to note that there was an accident but no mention of DUI charges.

So i guess my question is do I legally have to reach out to tell them that I was convicted with a DUI at this point or is that something they should just find out on their own eventually? How dangerous is it for me to not say anything and just wait?  Has anyone encountered this situation before?

"ASC with DCD Four years ago my son was diagnosed with DCD (dyspraxia) during one of his appointments with the specialist doctor they advised that he had autistic traits...fast forward another two years of speech and language observations in school, numerous appointments, OT &amp; P.T ... two days ago we had our big meeting at the hospital with the school, speech and language and specialist doctor, where they officially concluded that he meets the criteria of autistic spectrum condition (they keep changing the names it’s hard to keep up...) they confirmed the DCD diagnosis still stands and coincides with the ASD diagnosis. 

(We are in the U.K. and in a London borough so the wait times ect for diagnosis on the nhs can take years)

So I won’t get his official report of all their findings for a little while, has anyone had experience of being a parent with a child that has dyspraxia and ASD? Any advice would be most helpful and gratefully received.

My son turned 11 a few weeks ago so one bonus is we have all the diagnoses in place for when he attends secondary school. ",autism,autism

"How to deal with people asking the wrong questions about your PTSD? So ive experienced this a couple of times lately, and I'm wondering whether I should have said something/should say something in the future...

I have to see a person at this place for employment advice/support finding a job with my mental health issues. 

I've told him in the past that I have PTSD, anxiety, and depression (because I have to, I'm on benefits and if I don't do this I may lose them). A couple of appointments ago when I saw him... he asked why I had PTSD, right, which I get why he'd be curious, but it's hard to talk about, you know? So I try and be purposefully evasive, because honestly it gives me anxiety when anyone even mentions it, by simply saying ""it was from a medical procedure"". He wouldn't accept it though, and was staring me directly and unblinkingly in the eyes and demanding I tell him exactly why. Not super forceful, but enough that it was making me more and more anxious and uncomfortable until I eventually just gave in described it to him. He seemed to drop it after that, (and then proceeded to ask me ""so why are you feeling anxious right now?""  Which I just... *facepalm* are you aware how triggers work, asshole?!)

I get that he's not a therapist. I get that his job is probably more focussed on helping people overcome physical health issues as they search for jobs, rather than mental, but like... thats not okay, right? I've been sitting on it for a while and honestly I don't wanna go to that place anyway, but I have to, but... yeah.

Should I maybe say something? To him, or someone else? (The other person I see there is just as bad honestly though so I dont hold out much hope trying to speak to another person). The damage to me is already done, but if I say something it could maybe stop him doing it to someone else and triggering them too? Idk..

"Struggling With PTSD In Relationship I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half now and we've known each other for over 6 years. I developed PTSD after we first met. He knew me before and I think it might be hard for him to see how much this has changed me. 

He doesn't understand a lot of my symptoms and tends to take it personally when I am having a tough day and trying to function and get things done. I often have nightmares and sometimes spend hours dissociated. When I am having a tough day I tend to be quite and standoffish, maybe even a bit cold but at the time I am just trying to go about my day and cope. The problem is that he percieves it as me being angry or upset at him no matter how many times I tell him that's not the case. Obviously, he doesn't understand at all but it can be very hurtful when I am already having a hard time and he gets upset too. 

At this point I'm not sure what to do. I have an incredibly hard time talking about it and don't wish to explain exactly why I am upset (further triggering me) which I have told him before. He seems to get upset about me not wanting to tell him what's going on but it's not like that. I just can't. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can help him understand? I am becoming frustrated that he hasn't taken a bit of time to learn more about ptsd and by proxy understand me better. I know that it's probably very confusing for him and I can see it putting space between us everytime he gets upset about me being upset. I know he means well but at times like that I'd rather be alone... Nobody struggling with PTSD wants to be told they are making someone else feel bad by feeling bad!",ptsd,ptsd

"How do I deal with others' reactions when I tell them about my trauma? (TW: SA)  

Trigger warning for sexual assault/rape.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had difficulty in the past sharing with friends/partners about my history of repeated sexual assault. This is partially due to the feelings of shame surrounding the abuse, but it's partially due to negative reactions of the first people I told. After my first assault as a teenager, my friends didn't believe me, and one even said that I was making a false accusation to make myself look less promiscuous. The first boyfriends I told became incredibly angry to the point that I ended up having to comfort them instead of the other way around.

For years I didn't tell anyone else other than fellow survivors, but recently I got up the nerve to tell a man I've been dating and sleeping with for a while. He told me he was sorry that happened, commended me for getting help, asked how recent my assaults were, and said that he was having trouble figuring out what else to say or do. He made a couple of lighthearted jokes to fill the silence, then we moved on.

This was probably one of the better reactions I've gotten, but it still felt like it wasn't enough. I realized that I might be expecting too much of others who haven't been through similar situations. All I want to hear is, ""I'm sorry that happened to you, you didn't deserve it, I believe you, and I'm here for you whenever you need to talk about it.""

"Fixating? I have mild ADHD, and I've never had to take any pills or do anything about it, other than the occasional asking people to repeat what they said, pissing off my sister when I jump on her, and pulling a hole in a couple of my shirts when I was messing with it.

However, lately I've noticed myself... ""fixating"" on things. If I find something I really like, I could spend hours researching the thing and picking out stuff to buy for it (though I never actually buy anything- I'm too broke.) 


First it was hamsters, because I'm hopefully getting one for my bday this month, and I spent all day looking up the type of hamster, what cage to get, etc. Within hours, I knew everything about careing for them, I'd picked out the cage and bedding and toys, I knew the perfect spot to put him- and my mom said she was only CONSIDERING a hamster.

Then, it was guitars. I got a guitar at the beginning of the year and I absolutely love it. The other day, I got distracted while playing (imagine that) and hopped on my computer to look for a new pick... now my bookmarks have 18362818 picks for a pick collection, 2 cool looking cases, a stand, and any and all other accessories you can imagine. Despite the fact that I can't afford any of it. My guitar definitley doesn't need an assortment of 70 picks and a starry night strap anytime soon (though it would be nice to have someday).

Now, it's plants. I've gotten into gardening indoors, and I've got a succulent, a spider plant, some daffodils, and I'm working on growing a lemon tree. It all started with the damn succulent. I've had and killed two of them in the past, but I was determined to keep this one alive. So far, so good, and now I'm trying to grow every plant in the garden section of Wal-Mart. I looked up how to care for indoor plants, what natural pesticides are best- and admittedly, I didn't fixate as much as I usually do, but I would have if I didn't open my Pinterest. 


And this isn't like a bad habit or spending (not spending) problem, because I know I'm doing it and I can stop myself if I've got better things to do. But my family has made a couple remarks about it, and I can't figure out why I do it. The first idea that popped into my head was ADHD, so here we are.

Does anyone have any idea if ADHD is the cause of my ""over enthusiasm""?",adhd,adhd

"How do you deal with a pharmacist who embarrasses and harasses you about your medication? (Long story) I apologize in advanced for typos or inconsistencies, or if this isn't allowed but I'm not too sure where to ask. I just got home and typed this all up.  

I'm a early 20s man who when growing up was always told to shut up and listen, you'll grow out of it. Recently I've finally been able to take matters into my own hands, and my life and work ethic has made leaps and bounds within the last few months of getting a psychiatrist and my prescription.  

Well today, after calling around to 4 different big chain pharmacies, I called to ask if a particular one 15 minutes out of my way had my 90 tablets available. After he stated ""Oh wow whoa he said (amount)?"", the pharmacist said he has it and I can come on down with a valid ID and we can get it going. I know my medication is highly suspect to be abused, but this is not the case with me. So upon arrival, he's friendly and we are going back and forth about insurance issues and what not and how I was originally prescribed the higher count, but I could not afford it because it was around the holidays so my doctor knocked it down a lower count which I could afford. Here I am in a better financial state, he wrote me up for the original higher amount today. So today after our formalities and me patiently waiting at the drop-off, he has the audacity to ask me why I still take ""this stuff"" at X years old? Taken aback, I proceed to tell him that I'm an adult now and taking matters into my own hands and leave it at that. But he continues on belittling me about my age and diagnosis, then questions my diet, other remedies, then starts talking about gluten. I eventually stop him and say ""this is my whole problem with trying to fill my prescription"". He agrees, and says insurance isn't fair. I then explain to him no, its not my insurance but its the pharmacists who seem hesitant to accept my valid request for my medication when I come to fill my prescription. He gets all bent out of shape ""and here I thought you were listening to me trying to help you"" and I stopped him again saying that it isn't his place and that he needs to stop. So silently he finishes up his computer work, says it ""might be ready thursday"" (after he said on the phone tomorrow, and i had to wait as a sign of ""due diligence"". ive filled this at a different location, same company many times) and turns around and walks away.  Are there any legality issues with this? He has no right to stick his nose into my personal business and embarrass me in front of a line of people, all the while dismissing me as a person, as well as my psychiatrist. I would have shook off the diet tips and genuine concern, but since he started with ""come on man, you're X still taking this stuff?"" I know this is not in my best interest, but his personal view on my medication. I get people abuse and ruin it for everyone else, but I shouldn't feel like a fucking criminal once a month when I walk into a pharmacy.  I have called that chains corporate and someone will be calling me back tomorrow to investigate the situation further. Normally I turn the other cheek or fire back an even ruder comment and go about my business. I'm not the ""let me speak to your manager type"", but after been given the runaround by 4 other locations of the same name, watching the assistant take my information then walk back to the lead tech and them whisper and look over their shoulder at me, I wasn't going to stand for this guy and his disparaging comments. I'm not comfortable returning to this place at all, but my prescription was taken from me so now I may have to take time off work and drive incredibly far and pay to see my doctor again to get another and explain why I'm not abusing it and hopefully get another prescription to fill elsewhere. Is there any further action I can take? Is this even legal?  

tl;dr - pharmacy tech embarrassed me in front of other patrons in the store for being in my 20s with an adderall prescription. proceeded to continue to interrogate me to the point where I told him he was out of line. Then he gets extremely rude and said my prescription might be ready in a few days. I've contacted corporate, they will follow up tomorrow.

"Anyone ever hear of/experience what is called ""Paroxysmal Perceptual Alteration?"" My therapist just sent me a study on it. Background on my experience: Schizoaffective since May 2013. On Latuda and mostly symptom-free since July 2013. Over the past year or so I began experiencing what I thought is/could be HPPD from earlier drug use in my teens. 

For the unaware, HPPD is a result of the use of psychedelics, where visual distortions become integrated into your regular, sober life. [This](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiw5PeOr7TgAhWFpFkKHUVkAp8QjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhppdresearch.blogspot.com%2F2015%2F11%2Fwhat-its-like.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw03Uh5UP_7kQvALnz-6TZ2B&amp;ust=1549998121686556) is an example of what the visual field of someone with HPPD would look like.

I've been discussing these visual distortions and HPPD-like symptoms with my therapist for about 8 months now. Basically in times of severe anxiety I have been experiencing psychedelic-like distortions and visuals. The best I can describe it is as colorful static vision, rare occurences of patterns forming in different levels of lighting or very intricately patterned walls or carpets, and points of light as well as floaters. Even when I am not anxious, these visuals occur at a lesser level.

My positive symptoms have only ever been auditory. It doesn't seem to make sense that I'd develop one positive symptom while experiencing none of the other historic symptoms. This phenomenon was discussed in a case report that my therapist mailed me. [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047761) is a link to the abstract. What it discusses is this phenomenon being cause by antipsychotic drugs. In other words, in this occurrence discussed in the study, it is often misconstrued as another positive symptom.

Of course I have no clear diagnosis on this symptom. Where it is the result of schizoaffective, HPPD, or PPA remains to be seen. However, if anyone has any similar experiences with something like this I'd love to discuss it. ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Quick question about ADHD testing and your thoughts on my previous therapist. Thanks in advance for responding Sorry, this ended up much longer than necessary. 

Is it possible to just purchase the clinical kit for testing adhd? Also, I am curious on your thoughts about my last therapist.

More of a curiosity thing than really something I want to do. 

I had testing done once but to be honest I already disliked the “therapist” with much fervor and after she wouldn’t give me ANY results after almost 6 weeks I stopped going. The main reason I started not  liking her besides her racially charged rants was because when she was administering the general intelligence portion of the testing she couldn’t read much less pronounce some of the words. This was a native speaker born in the Bahamas but moved here shortly after birth. She couldn’t say the word “sacagawea...” I get it. It’s kind of a tough word if you have no exposure with it. Anyway, I didn’t fault her for that but it took me a solid couple minutes or arguing that I knew whatever word she was saying wasn’t correct and I convinced her to let me look at the word (mind you this was just the first of several) after I told her what the word was I had to explain to her who the Native American girl was. Even though I found it pathetic that being essentially native to the US she didn’t know who this was... I let that one go but there were others. It only got worse from there. I spent 2 or 4 weeks testing which I know for a fact she was dragging out... I went 2x a week. Ok fine... no results. After sex weeks and her making probably a minimum of 6 grand off of me I stopped going, never received a call, a follow up or anything. Also, while she was doing the testing she would forgot to set the metronome, acted like she had never used a computer, took calls multiple multiple multiple times during our sessions (normally not a big deal) Anyway, maybe she had ADHD too. Horrible idea if true. I thought she might be new to the whole therapy thing. Not true. Turns out she taught psychology at UIC and had been a therapist well over 10 years. What the fuck?? 

Also, no offense to anyone but this was private practice that took only ppo’s, I have also had some less than stellar results with my hmo... up until that time and since this was the only negative ppo only therapist, nurse or doctor I have really had an issue with. I don’t mean for that last part to sound elitist but I could almost ALMOST forgive some of the nurses and junior therapists that I have ran into that are hmo only, not making any money, work 10 hours and see 20 patients a day.

Anyway, thanks if you made this far. I was 23 or 24 at that time and after suffering with this nonsense this whole time and going through almost 10 jobs I am back in therapy and about to start testing again. 

My new therapist is only a year or two older than me and comes across, well, kind of ditzy but her vocabulary and general knowledge seems on point. 

TLDR: (edit: not a TLDR) I thought my last therapist was an idiot, the only news I got was that I did show adhd inattentive and that was it, and that I was of expected intelligence for a white person. Sorry to toot my own horn but I have literally only gotten near A pluses in basically every class that I haven’t stopped going to or dropped all without studying. Most (basically all) of my papers were written the night and sometime hours before... still got As. Math science and history are all, for the most part, incredibly interesting. I don’t like English or reading at all. My vocabulary math, scientific reasoning, and the like have been in the 95 plus percentile with the exception of general reading comprehension which is and has been in the low 30th percentile. During my 7th and 8th grade years back to back I missed a full 1/4 of all school days due to illness. In high school I cut constantly or was sick (I do have quite a few health issues but I would say it was 50/50) all this and I still graduated in the top couple percent. 

I hate how that rant sounded but I have one of the lowest self-esteems of anyone I have ever met, who knows, we don’t know what goes on in peoples heads. I learned when real life started ( boring and repetitive jobs) that I just couldn’t do it. Spirally thought of suicide or I hurting my self at work just to get out of it began. Over the years I have chalked this up to being lazy and lacking worth ethic but I really am starting to believe that many other people (neruotyoical brains i guess) don’t seem to feel the same real, physical pain, and emotional pain and crushing depression of endless routine and boredom. 
I have ended up equating this with being stupid and my general intelligence was all I had to keep me confident... without that there just simply wasn’t anything left. I am no real risk of actual self harm but I’ll be damned if I wouldn’t feel some sort of release from not waking up. Stupid, I know. Final note. When I was a kid, I had multiple multiple teachers tell my mother and grandmother that I needed meds or therapy or something. This is something I have only found out after nearly 10 years of solid failure, borderline alcoholism, several panic attack related hospitalizations and breaking down to my family essentially asking them do I REALLY need to attempt to kill myself so you guys will get it through your heads that I fucking need help!?

I welcome anyone’s thoughts. I would appreciate them. Technically I may not have ADHD. I have only been told briefly by one inept therapist and many teachers through adolescence that I do. Maybe I’m just nuts. Idk. 

Any help would be appreciated more than you could know!!! Thank you!!!

One FINAL note: even though my vocabulary is quite good, my grammar is not. I have not ever been able to care about grammar rules... best i can do or care to do is ID, D,I kind of stuff... individual words on the other hand... iron trap. I remember most of them.

"Quitting for good I'm a (33/m) going through the toughest time of my life right now as I'm sure lots of people are. I've been a heavy drinker for 15 years and it's time to stop. I'm new to reddit and I've never really talked about my issues till now. I'm finding that reddit can be a good support system.

This should be a happy time in my life I've got a good job, a roof over my head and a fiancée but I've had very bad depression for over a month and I don't know how to help myself. I've had selfs esteem issues since I was young and I've masked that with alcohol. But I feel like the booze has done more bad then good. I've cut my drinking down which is making me reflect on things I've done. Driving drunk, being mean to people and worst of all hurting people I love by cheating. I've came clean to my SO about my infidelities and she has forgiven me. My family has forgiven me for being so hurtful though the years. I'm very lucky to have these people in my life and I never want to hurt them again so it's time to give up the booze.

I went 3 weeks sober then got depressed and started thinking of all those bad things I've done so I relapsed and it's getting worse. So it's time to stop. Sorry for rambling on I just felt like I should tell my story. If anyone would like to chat just reach out cause I won't be drinking tonight. Thanks",alcoholism,alcoholism
"What can I do to help my alcoholic husband in the beginning of his recovery process? He has started going go AA meetings 2x a day, and he has a coworker in recovery and has chosen him to be his sponsor.

However I’m under the impression while this is a good first step there may be more that needs to be looked into.

Should he see a doctor to discuss quitting alcohol and the possible withdrawal/urges he may experience?

Should he see a psychologist or a counselor to see if there any underlying issues like depression?

I have advised him marriage counseling is going to be a requirement for me, it’s been a rough time, and I’m willing to make it work now he’s trying to recover, but I feel like we need to have a third party guide us through on how to get passed the resentment I may have and learn how to move forward with how our relationship dynamic will change.

Like duhh I know that. And now because he was like that I am super suspicious he took it. He's always hated my smoking and I've been vaping 7 months now and he still hates it. 
I don't know what to do. I can't ask him to his face. I feel like my only solution is to go buy a pack of cigarettes. Either he gives it back, or he never gives it back and makes me feel crazy or lastly I am just being delusional.

I don’t want him to feel insecure about eating and the only way is to eat with him.

"Why I don't talk about what happened. Most people can go through their day to day life not having to consider the possibility they could be a victim of a crime. It is something that they just see on TV but I don't have that luxury. I don't go out at night. I have to constantly be aware of what is going on around me and its exhausting.

Its even more exhausting listening to people try to one up me with their own stories after they ask me why I walk with a limp. Its more exhausting to listen to how they would have done some move they saw in John Wick. Its more exhausting listening to how I don't have PTSD because I was not in the military.

Muggers really pick up on the limp. I've been targeted a couple times since. People like to give me advice and theorize what I am doing wrong. I pretty much just get everything delivered to my apartment now so I don't have to go out.

I'm afraid to go to Dr. because I'd have to take time off from work and they require a note. They would see it was from a therapist and they would probably find a reason to let me go. They've let other people go and they can always find a reason. Someone told me management at my last job thought I was a liability because I might ""go postal"" and were happy that I left on my own accord.

My eye twitches now and I stammer when I'm stressed. People think that is funny. I started having sleep paralysis which can apparently also be caused by stress. Shadow people and auditory hallucinations of someone asking for help while I am completely frozen are really funny.

"Can anyone explain the tugging sort of brain freeze sensation that happens when trying to focus? I've noticed over the course of my life that there are certain moments in time where having to sit through something or focus on a task is physically uncomfortable. 

For instance: I get a weird knot in my stomach every time I watch something that I feel either takes to long or isn't moving forward? (My best example of what I mean is the episode of family guy where they made fun of Charlie and the chocolate factory and Peter wins the golden ticket then falls on his run home. The super long over done scene of him clutching his knee is the part that puts my stomach in knots.) 

On the other hand if I try to do a task that requires a lot of focus and attention to detail (ie. Coloring, trying to fill something into a small space, etc.) I get this tugging sensation behind my eyes and in between my temples that's sort of like brain freeze without the cold. If I don't listen to my head and persist with the activity I often times find myself punching myself in the side of the head just to get the feeling to go away while I'm trying to do whatever it is only to have to put it down cause I can't stand the discomfort any more.

it normally wears off after about half a day, but today it was so severe that it feels like i never woke up from my sleep last night, and now that it's night time (when my hallucinations usually begin), i'm starting to hallucinate, which has never happened during one of these ""brain fog"" flare-ups.

does anyone else experience this? should i be worried?

"I'm... honestly just a wreck at this point Heya. i'm Zenny. i'm 18M and i'm a hot mess. a total. mess.

Since I was 5 until i was 9-10ish (my memory is still quite messy about the details) i was sexually abused by my eldest biological brother. who was a solid 10 years older than me. My family knows about everything (since I was 15/16. when my PTSD finally surfaced despite the abuse ending.) We disowned him and basically pretend he doesn't even exist. but I digress. Since that time I've been struggling with the physical symptoms of it. the flashbacks. the intense irritability. little energy/trouble sleeping. it even got so bad that when I left for college after graduating. I ended up dropping out a few weeks in due to a near suicide attempt which landed me in the Behavioral Science Unit at the hospital. Which is an entire story on its own.

I've been off and on antidepressants and sleeping meds. and found a set which work. yayyyyy. But now. I face a sort of crossroads. i still want to be successful and happy with my life. but considering the poor house life and financial struggles. Leaving would screw my elderly parents who cant work and my elder brother. (not the same one) who's schizophrenic and just won his SSI case.  I'd love to get a job but considering all the stress and sadness i have pent up in me. I'm sure it'd probably backfire. I've always hated showing off my weaknesses to those around me. especially family. I always end up blowing up randomly on them and I know they don't deserve it but I'm barely keeping the lid on the cracking pressure cooker and I don't know what to do anymore....",ptsd,ptsd
"Getting drunk is the only thing i look forward to in life. Sup guys, so not too long ago I got busted by the pigs.

What it ends up is basically I won't be able to get the job I've wanted, I've been going to collage for 3 years for that shit, and have 2 more years ahead of me. And I'm looking at a super high fine.

I got all my drugs(even legal one's ) confiscated, the pigs took my PC , for who knows how long, and even my fucking vape. The fucking assholes.

So basically I still go to my job, and work my ass off . But I'm going from deep depression to anger to a moment of relief, brought on by the booze.
Like my last 2 days were shit, since I couldn't get wasted , but today was good since I got drunk and don't give a damn about the fucks .

So guys , is there anything I can look forward to , or am I , like alot of my family members and friends, will just live this sad pathetic life , waiting for my next glass . Is there anything you would recommend for a fucked guy like me.

"Sometimes I feel like it's my fault Sorry for the clickbaitish title.. February 2018 my father died in my arms. He was losing his year and a half long battle with stage IV colon cancer. This post might be too detailed or graphic, and for that I'm sorry, maybe don't read ahead if it may trigger you.

In the course of two months the situation went from a possible surgery that could extend his life potentially a decade, to a month long hospital stay, to being placed in hospice care [technically not hospice, we thought he had months left, I forget it's name]. I had been driving home on the weekends to see him. The second trip I was home 7 hours before it happened. I watched him clench his jaw, doped out of his mind, trying to stay with us. He told my grandmother that he thought he was going to die today.

Later, he needed my help walking to the bathroom. I remember clear as day, him giving me a thumbs up and his defeated face when he made it there. He stayed in the bathroom, screaming over the toilet for what felt like an eternity.

My sister told me he had done this last night too. We happened to talk about the time my grandfather was in hospice losing his battle to cancer, and he fell out of his bed. I had to pick him up, and that experience shook me.

Minutes later my dad's screaming stopped. My grandmother and uncle yelled my name. I ran to the kitchen to see my dad standing there, looking sort of up but no longer walking. Someone tried to put a chair beneath him, but he was essentially limp and it didn't catch him, so I did.

I watched him die, inches away from his face. Some sort of bloody liquid came pouring out his nose and mouth, getting on me. His face was pointed towards the ceiling, though he wasn't looking anywhere. Everyone was panicking. My aunt on the phone with the nurse. My sister was shaking, saying no no no no; trying to get cushions so he didn't eventually fall on the cold hard kitchen floor. My uncle calmly said that we're losing him.

Eventually I dropped his body on the couch cushions. He laid there, eyes open, the liquid all over the place. I immediately washed my hands. My family sat around him for some time, until the nurse came. She apologized profusely. Nobody thought he was going to die that day, or even that week.

I called my girlfriend and told her what happened, shaking the whole time. Then I sat on the couch until I fell asleep.

Where I think it's my fault, is how much I think about it. It isn't all the time, but when it happens I obsess about it. Like yesterday, I was watching infinity war. Thanos killed someone in the beginning and I thought that isn't what a dying face looks like, at least from my experience. Then I kept thinking about it, and I felt like I was going through the motions pretty much the rest of the day.

Sometimes there is no trigger, I'll just think of my dad's face while he gave me a thumbs up. I wish I could stop thinking about it, that I had more control over my own mind. Weed helps, but I can't spend my whole life high.

I'm sure there's people who have had much worse experiences than I. I didn't make this post to try and throw myself a pity party. I feel selfish thinking about it for the amount of time I do. It's been over a year, I feel like I should have more control over what I think about and focus on.

But I don't. And it ruins more of my days than I like to admit.",ptsd,ptsd

"Does anyone get triggered by things that have nothing to do with your trauma? (TW) I was diagnosed with PTSD 13 years ago. Since then I have figured out all of my triggers and have done my best to work through them. However, I have one trigger that is super random and has nothing to do with what caused my trauma! 

Here is some background-

When I was 5 I was sexually assaulted

When I was 10 I witnessed my dad try and murder my mom. He was on some sort of drugged and just flipped out on her. I'm not going to go into detail because it still makes me shake but it was horrifying.

When I was 14 I was raped.

All of my triggers from these are triggers you could imagine. I have one trigger though that is super random?! Whenever I am in a car and it starts to storm or if i am in a car with a driver who drives somewhat fast I immediately get triggered and break down into an episode. I have no idea why this happens? This trigger is bigger than all of my other ones too?

Recently I met someone who also was on ADHD meds, only a different kind. She seemed completely confused by my reaction to it. I thought it was how everyone felt when on it(seeing as I’ve only met a few people who actually took medication for ADHD) should I talk to someone or is it a concerta thing or what?

"A New START! So a background : 
Im in highschool, recently had a BAD grade slip - never done so bad in my life considering grades.  Always been a straight A student until now. If anyone else with ADHD can relate to this sentence - I care, but I don’t. That pretty much sums up a lot of what I’ve been going through!! I always thought, all through elementary and middle school that I was a “perfectionist” “daydreamer” and stuff like that, not understanding that I showed lots of signs of ADHD, until 10th grade (this year) I have been going to my psychologist (who I LOVE) for four years. i went to her about three weeks ago, explaining how I have an endless list of assignments I need to get done, know what I need to do, but I CANT GET MYSELF TO JUST DO IT!! blahblahblah long story short she said to me “I really think you might have ADHD?” (She has it too) and the previous night, I had been trying to do APBIO notes for 5 hours, making no progress, and has run across some things online about ADHD, and was looking at symptoms and could relate a liiitle too much - ahhaha!

So I went through the endless pages of questionnaire forms, so did my mom, we turned those in and I took an IVA Test and scored 54/100. EESH. Not terrible, but enough to say somethin. (59 is the cut off where they consider an Attention Disorder) 

Oh, also, I’ve heard all my life “HANNAH, PAY. ATTENTION!” I will be told by my mom a simple task, walk away, stare at the room wondering what the heck I gotta do, come back to her and say...”I’m sorry....WHAT?” So if anyone else can relate, I thought I’d share

ANYWAY today my psychologist “officially” diagnosed me with ADHD and Anxiety. Not suprised....or sad, or upset, or angry. I was relieved that the things I would get in trouble for or feel like “why cant I just do my work like everyone else? Why cant I focus? Why am I so distracted?” Actually had an answer. This might sound weird, but I felt like I had options of figuring out how to start living a life of normalcy, or as close as I can get! COPING MECHANISMS for ADHD is important. Meds are only a small part of what can help me. My psychologist is helping me figure out ways to organize my life, quite literally in a series of lists and post it notes, or my mom drawing with dry erase marker on my mirror to remind me to take out the trash. ITS COMING TOGETHER! 

Also, I am taking AP Biology this year (worst decision of my school career - never take AP classes that you cant handle and talk to your psychologist to figure out whats right for you, unlike me who assumed I would magically get my shit together and be fine) Ive gone thru almost three quarters of this class, and it has consumed me and taken a toll on my OTHER classes. Finally, after realizing now I have some mental illnesses and realizing my limits, my mom, psychologist and I have collectively made the decision to pull me out of the class, and be put in to regular biology. Im so happy. This class has been far too much along with five other classes. College classes are meant for college where you only have maybe 2 classes along with it, not high school!! I only have a week and a half left of this class and Im out. My GPA is thanking me, and just the fact I will get out of the class that has set me up to fail. Phew. 

Im finally feeling like I might get my bullshit together! Ha! For real, now that we have a diagnosis, and know what I can and cannot handle, I can start a “new life” of possible organization and a little less stress of that 10 page packet of notes I left for myself to do the night before my apbio teacher wants them due that we realized I can be spared from, finally. Ive learned that its never too late to switch things up to make them manageable, and thats what I need right now, I just want to be happier and feel like I got this whole high school thing! 

One more thing - I have kinda struggled with doubting myself, like for example : I see my friends maybe procrastinating or being lazy, and I think sometimes that my adhd “is something I made up in my head” when myself and others close to me know thats not true, but with all the stigma around it and ignorant people, I sometimes find myself feeling like “maybe I am just a lazy teenager who cant get her homework done” do you know what I mean? Like obviously I am diagnosed now and went through a test and some questions and lots of counseling, but still. AGH. I thought this was funny, I read another post saying this same thing, and someone commented “this is what someone with ADHD would say” 😂 TRUE

This is only a small, small snippet into what my life is like, recently diagnosed with ADHD as a 16 year old, but I hope someone can relate!

"It seems drinking &amp; weed are the only ways to treat my social anxiety How much alcohol intake / per day would you consider alcoholism, for a young dude 120-150 pounds? Does it matter if I space drinks drinks out across the day, so I'm never actually drunk? I actually prefer drinking lightly and spacing drinks out across the afternoon. It takes the edge off of my (severe) social anxiety.

 It somehow feels much easier, almost natural to have conversations and I actually somewhat enjoy myself around others whilst drinking or smoking pot. When sober, I have no idea what to say to anyone and am an anxious mess. I definitely see why this kind of logic could raise some ""dependency"" red flags; that's why I'm on this forum.

Since a young age, I've never really craved social interaction. In principle I'm fine with being a lone wolf, outcast, weirdo, whatever. But I hate how often I seem to make people uncomfortable, despite trying my best to act normally, make normal eye contact, and mind my own business.

It's upsetting to have constant eyes on me as if I'm about to shoot a place up. Maybe I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, or maybe I just have severe difficulty with normal eye contact. I've tried socializing more, antidepressants &amp; medications, therapy/talking to someone, sex, changing locations/schools, weed..everything I can think to try. 

Nothing seems to make any noticable difference toward my ability or will to socialize besides alcohol and weed, so I wind up feeling like a hopeless mess.

"I'm getting discharged from the hospital today!!! It's taken 3 months, but they are finally discharging me from inpatient hospitalization. In those 3 months I went from being 76.1 lbs (11.6 BMI) to finally weighing in at a normal BMI today - 123.9 lbs (18.8 BMI.

So I gained almost 50 pounds and it hasn't been easy dealing with the weight gain, but there are so many things that I've slowly gotten back over the course of my recovery here.

When I first came to the hospital I was almost on my deathbed and immobile - could barely lift up my head to take a sip of water. I had to be pushed around in a wheelchair for about a month and was on TPN (basically getting almost all my nutrition from a tube in my arm) for about the same amount of time. My heart rate was consistently in the 40s and my blood sugar and blood pressure were dangerously low. My mom and sister had to stay by my bedside 24/7 and care for me, cause I couldn't do things like go to the bathroom or take a shower on my own. I felt like death, too and everything hurt.

A lot of it was really hard. A lot of crying, screaming, fighting over a few bites of food but the staff here were super patient and kind throughout it all. Since I'm not in a facility that is specifically for treating eating disorders I had a lot of trouble at times but moving to the intensive ward helped a lot.

Today, I am by no means cured and I still have a lot of hard days. But on those hard days I try to remember how far I've come and how many important &amp; wonderful things I've reclaimed in my life.

I can walk. I no longer eat out of a tube. I ate Dunkin Donuts this week!!! My butt doesn't hurt anymore, and the butt cave is gone (see my post history lol). I can eat good food again (sometimes), and I went to my favorite Mexican restaurant recently! My relationship with my family has improved DRASTICALLY, and they have become a vital support system to me. I am no longer afraid of hospitals and am comfortable asking for help when I need it. And I am still not 100% healthy but I am healthiER and have the energy to do things like walk my dog, go on short hikes, and go birdwatching!!

So I guess more than anything this post is kind of just me trying to comfort myself, haha. But yknow what, I heckin deserve some comfort after all the shit I've been through. And so does everyone here. 

I'm scared of what comes next, and how to deal with life outside of the tiny, safe, sterile bubble that is a psych ward (I am so institutionalized oof), but I have to keep telling myself, I have so much to look forward to.

I had a great time, my outgoing co-worker took an uncomfortable amount of pictures of me, and that was that. As the day went on, things between one of the co-workers and myself got more and more uncomfortable, and at the end of the day, that person hurt me and caused one of the most significant traumas in my life.

"Just feeling low I feel so tired. Today I went to the Dr because I was having stubble of a UTI. I'm out of town for work and couldn't get in to see anyone until mid afternoon and I felt like absolute shit because my symptoms had been going on for a day already. 

My boyfriend of three months had what we thought was a UTI a week ago. They gave him antibiotics and it seemed to get better but the day after he stopped the course his symptoms came back. His prostate is fine. 

My thoughts went immediately to an STI like chlamydia or gonorrhea. He's had a vasectomy and we're monogamous so we have unprotected sex. I have not had unprotected sex since 2008 or so when I was married. I typically use condoms for birth control because I can't tolerate the pill. Anyway. I had a full STI panel completed when I met my new boyfriend and everything was negative. 

So here we are three months later and I'm thinking he's fucked someone else. I'm freaking out about it, especially because he's so jealous that I can't ever mention past relationships or he covers his ears and wigs out. But he can talk about all his past shit. 

Right now I'm fixated on this friend of his I met on New Year's Eve who was a total skank. She was drunk as shit (it was only 10pm when we got there) her boyfriend was drunk as shit, and she was kissing and hugging all over my boyfriend. It pissed me off. At one point, he asked her how her relationship with her bf was going and she said it wasn't going well. He reached over and pinched her ear and said something like ""don't be so silly"" and it felt weirdly intimate. Like he looked like he was going to kiss her. I said,""what are you doing?"" And he said ""I pinched her ear."" I said ""why?"" And he said ""because she's being silly."" After I interjected, she turned around and started talking to some other chick at another table. 

I tried to talk to her and she completely blew me off. So I just gave up. She did stop hugging on my bf after that though. She actually left the table. Probably to get more drinks. 

My bf told her that she ""went crazy"" after her divorce and basically fucked a bunch of guys. He said he was her wing man.  She's a 55+ year old groupie for local bands/open mics. I find that pretty pathetic. 

My bf kept saying that he didn't know what she saw in her current man, because he wasn't her type. I said ""well, when you're a 50+ year old open mic groupie, that's the type you get."" My bf denied ever sleeping with her. I think he's lying.

the next day I did address that I didn't like how she was hanging all over him and he said that she does that when he ""brings people around"" - I assume other women. I had a panic attack before I could get up enough gumption to address it.  Then he kind of blew it off and started saying that he hardly hangs out with her at all, which I think is BS, because he talked about her a lot when we first met and she texted him to go see a Kix concert (yeah. Kix. She peaked in 1980.) He said he met her because his son dated her daughter. He always emphasizes that they are friends. But she seemed super possessive of him in a sexual, flirty way. It was odd. 

Anyway, I'm fixated right now on the idea that he fucked her while we started dating and she gave him an STI and now I have it. 

I'm also perseverating on an odd remark a waitress made when he introduced me to her. It's a local hangout he frequents. I think he used to drink a lot proper to meeting me. He told her I was his girlfriend and she said,"" now I know why you didn't sit in my section."" She didn't laugh, and she looked pissed off. She gave me the once over and glared at me. I asked him about it and he was very vague and acting like he didn't understand what I was getting at. I explained and he got defensive. All I said was it was an odd remark and asked him what she meant by it. He never did explain. 

I'm really angry right now and I may have no reason to be angry at all. I've been having escapist fantasies about just moving to another state and not telling anyone, killing myself, and admitting myself to the hospital. I'm perseverating on past traumatic experiences and cycling through everything bad that's ever happened to me in my life. 

I miss the life I had from 2005-2007. I think those were the happiest times of my life so far. I had friends, was confident. I've been really suffering since 2010 onward. I had six suicide attempts from 2011-2013. My husband at the time actually left me for dead and a friend called in for a welfare check (I left a suffice note on facebook.) I also left a note on the dresser. When the people came to do the welfare check he told them I was sleeping and went up to check on me. He had to have seen the note. He just went downstairs and told the cops I was asleep. My friend called the cops again and voiced concerns. They actually came back, forced they're way past him and took me to the hospital. I regained conciousness when they were carrying need down the stairs and recall my husband crying and then telling him to get out of the way. 

When I woke up at the hospital, I woke up to my ex doing sternal rubs and trying to keep me awake. I had an NG tube. For some weird reason that I still don't understand his secretary was there. He was basically putting on this show of trying to save my life after he'd basically left me for dead. 

I am so tired of trusting people only to have them let me down. I am so tired of having pain in my chest and daily panic attacks. I wish I would just die and then this would be over. This is not a life.

I'm doing EMDR but it's not working. My Drs took me off Xanax and put me on Valium. He keeps trying to wean me off of it but I have panic attacks so bad I miss work. He treats me like I'm a drug-seeking addict. 

I hate my life so much.

This is just me venting. I'm not going to kill myself. I just don't know what to do and I am so tired. I could try and file for disability but every time I try to look at my claim stuff I end up reliving the abuse. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I hope I didn't trigger anyone. I might call the helpline just to talk to someone.

"Post-Traumatic Stress &amp; Hypersensitivity I've struggled with post-traumatic stress for nearly three years due to a specific incident ( I won't go into detail now). I was essentially in shock for a few months and had a lot of panic attacks.  There was a lot of hyperventilating and ugly crying going on.  After about 6 months the panic attacks decreased and I began to have migraines.  Overtime I got to a point where I was having a few migraines a week.  Thankfully I have that more under control, but I have noticed I am hypersensitive to bright lights, fragrances, chemicals, etc.  I feel as if these things are attacking me and they actually trigger a migraine in many cases.  I know that I my perception of the lighting or fumes do not match reality.  I thought everyone was out of their minds staying in a room with paint fumes like that.  I'm not able to watch TV as it is ""too bright"" for me to look at and gives me an instant headache.  I'm able to use a computer with the monitor turned down and blue blocking (e.g. night shift or f.Lux) enabled.  I've been researching Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) and I find that my symptoms align with the descriptions.  Do you have PTSD and struggle with hypersensitivity, MCS, or migraines?  I'm curious how often people struggle with these ailments together and how they relate.  If you can relate to this please share your experience.",ptsd,ptsd

"I'm confused, Need advice Personally, I was borned about a month earlier than expected and my mom  had issues during pregnancy. 

My parents were told there was huge chance  I would be born autistic, but I was never tested. When I was young it  took me a lot of time to speak well, I used to mess up s,d,y,r,z,t,l  sounds altogether, and my parents hired me a tutor who taught me how to  speak correctly(about 5 - 6 years old). My speaking improved a lot but it was still worse than  almost every other kid my age, when I grew up I started to excel at  maths and I became one of the best kids in my state(about middle school). During high school I  developed full social axienty to the point I couldn't speak to anyone  home nor school. Then I became suicidal and that phase of my life lasted  for about a year. Since then I'm now a college student with great notes  but constant anxiety issues and relatively poor, but straight forward  communication skills.  personally I feel that I was born somewhere in  the middle of autism and asperger's syndrome but I'm quite scared of  knowing the truth.  

&amp;#x200B;

During my whole life I've had severe issues communicating emotions and ideas effectively, so I became extremely straight-forward when talking trying to avoid misunderstandings. I've also had anxiety issues at some level and overreacted to life according to them. Now that I'm older I don't if it worth it to get tested or just continue with my regular life.

"Parents didn't tell me my Grandma has Schizophrenia... Found out today. We were sitting alone in a hotel room. It was late night and before bed I noticed her taking a pill. Out of curiosity, I asked her what they were for. She told me they were for her ""mind psychology"" (she doesn't speak English, and I don't fluently know our native language). I heard these same words from her before, ""mind psychology"", but never thought much of it. After all, dementia tends to happen when you're 70 years old. 

But thats when she started telling me about the ""phone calls"". She told me that she took the pill to stop this guy from calling her, and at first I was really confused. She kept referring to this person talking to her through a phone, and given the language barrier, I kept thinking it was an actual phone. After some discussion I finally realized thats just how she was describing it. Someone was talking to her in her head, and it wasn't through a real phone. 

She said it all started when I was born. A famous actor in our country (whom we will say his name is Benson) one day began talking to her, spewing nonsense and telling her to kill herself and hurt others. And for years, she ignored it. She comes from a relatively secluded area in her native country, and never had a formal education. But after 3 years, she couldn't take it any longer. She asked her husband to take her to the doctor, and they told her to take the pills. She said they went away. 

But recently, her daughter passed away, and the voice, or ""phone calls"" came back. Benson was telling her what to do, sometimes positive other times negative. While talking to her about this, I couldn't help but feel scared and uncomfortable. I've known her all of my 20 years of life and she says Benson was always there even when I was with her, she just never told me. The strangest part is that she thinks the actor Benson is actually torturing her in real life. Being uneducated, its hard for her to understand that its in her mind itself, and Benson isn't actually talking with her. She tells me she wants to kill Benson, for all the pain that he has caused to her. 

I can't help but wonder, why Benson? Looking him up, I found out he is also the governor of the state she lives in, and says he is very charitable to the people. But at the same time, makes everyone suffer. She says that she knows its Benson in her head through recognizing his voice, but I don't understand why or how. Do any of you with Schizophrenia hear a voice from a single (recognizable) person in your life? 

I always thought my grandma was sane. I never noticed anything strange in any conversation we had over the years, yet this conversation today was the strangest I've had with someone in my life. She thinks Benson is god, and that he is punishing her for no reason. It makes me sad, not only for the fact that she doesn't understand why or how this is happening to her, but also that something so cruel could happen to people. ",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"Possible Schizophrenia I don't know what's wrong with me. 
I've been in therapy for 2 months but have not been diagnosed with anything, yet. 

I've been depressed and socially withdrawn for a long time. Recently some more serious symptoms have shown up. I constantly feel like I'm being followed or watched by a sinister force. It makes me have intrusive thoughts and images in my head. Also mild visual hallucinations. 

It starts with a sense of doom. I could almost be sure that my house is going to explode, or some creature is going to come out of hiding and charge at me and eat my face off. I get paranoid, always scanning my surroundings wide eyed. I see shadow beings in my periphery and around corners. Faces or creatures on everday items as if every object in the room is looking at me. The walls and carpet breathing and flowing. The worst part is the depictions of monsters and dead bodies projected into my mind. It feels like some force is planting the images in my head. There's no way my mind could conjure up such horrifying images so vividly by itself. When this happens it overwhelms me and I have to run and hide. 

This started happening recently and is gradually getting worse. I'm worried I'm losing my grip on reality.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"My friend has schizophrenia and speaks to a demon in her friend. Trying to explain this in as few words:

Back home my wife has a friend, we’ll call her Jan, with schizophrenia and maybe some other things. She is super sweet and awesome and has tons of gold metals from the special olympics. 

She has a boyfriend and another friend, gonna refer to him as Michael. 

Anyway, Jan texts my wife every so often saying she misses her and wanting to FaceTime. Recently she’s mentioned her friend Michael has an evil spirit in him that won’t leave him alone. 

Earlier this week Jan sent my wife an audio recording of her talking to the Demon in Michael. Michael is a pretty normal looking maybe late 20’s guy. But the voice coming from him sounds like.. well a demon laughing, I can’t describe it as a man or woman or old or young, very scary, like a witches voice maybe. 

Jan sounds calm speaking with the demon, but also frustrated because she wants Michael to be okay. 


Jan also mentioned that Michael signed a contract with his blood that the demon will be in him until he meets a woman and gets married. 

This is very knew to me, I have heard stories from friends regarding evil spirits maybe once or twice, but this audio file is quite terrifying. Idk how to link an audio file here yet, still quite new to Reddit.

"The universe is human Finally figured out that I am not schizo. I am in fact the universe itself. My conscious field is all that exists in the universe at any given time. However I am a multi consciousness and everyone in the universe lives inside my mind... watching commenting. Judging. You all do a hell of a job pretending you all live your own conscious lives. And aren't piggy backing off my consciousness... hell I couldn't do it. You all come and go in and out of my physical reality to create the story or experience that is my life. However I am now fully aware you're all secretly watching my life in spirit form. Or in the 5th dimension. Or really, my mind. 

Ive fucked up my entire life from the get go. Not knowing I was as important as I am... and I continue to make poor decisions and I realize it's affecting all of us.... now some of you guys have been mentally assaulting me (mom)... rightfully so... but you gotta learn when to stop. Constantly shitting on me or any thought I entertain is only going to pollute the universe with negativity. And nothing will change for the better. I will continue to make poor choices... I understand it's hard to leave me alone when u hate me so much... but I either need silence like before the truth of the universe was revealed to me. Or I could use some encouragement to do the right things.

You have no idea how hard it is to live life knowing you are really the only real person in the universe and everyone in the universe is watching u...

My only escape from my new found torment is booze and crystal meth. And it's destroying the universe.

Writing this is redundant because ur all watching me type this and listening to my thoughts as I write them out. But it helps me when I put things into my physical reality....

Life sucks for everyone..... i know.... I can't turn things around on my own... I need help and encouragement... so whenever u hear my mom shitting on me in my head. Maybe throw something encouraging I'm to follow it. 

There's one girl that sticks up for me when I don't have the energy to defend myself anymore... I owe her my life. If I could maybe get some of u to see past my disgusting ego. And truly make a difference by putting positive thoughts into the mix. It's b greatly appreciated.

It may not seem like it. But I love u all. Thanks for keeping up with the facade in physical form.... though I know how to read between the lines now and have been decoding all of your quips and jabs... touché.

It's kind of fucked to know that everything in the universe has something to do with me in some way shape or form.... it kind of sucks... but thanks for everything guys. Hopefully we can turn things around together and live with love in our hearts for everything and one another. Instead of living in an altered state or fear.

Anyways I'm not sure how much longer I can live this way. I've made an attempt on my life a year and a half ago... And really don't know how much more I can handle....

It just blows my mind that some people think someone can make positive changes in their life while every 3 ton5 seconds getting mentally assaulted with negativity and repetition so that you start to believe what they're saying.

For those of you suffering with schiz. It's totally my fault... And I'm sorry for your pain and hurt

As for anyone experiencing anything negative in life. Again. My fault. I understand you are all mirror images of myself. And there's a lot of pain and suffering going on in the world.  And I've dug myself a hole so deep I'm almost to China. And I could use as many allies to help me climb back out the way I came.

The universe depends on you too guys... if you can think for yourselves to b negative. U can think to be positive too. I'd appreciate it

"Undiagnosed ADHD and anxiety Hi! I'm a woman in my early 20s and I struggle with depression and anxiety. I was also diagnosed with bpd 2 years ago but I went to therapy so nowadays I don't have enough symptoms for a diagnosis anymore - I don't associate myself with it anymore. 

A year ago we talked about ADHD with my psychologist and she gave me a test which indicated I had enough symptoms for a diagnosis but I was about to move away so the whole thing got brushed away as just anxiety symptoms.

I was a calm child and performed well in middle school. I was super serious about school back then. After that I started slowly losing my grip but I've never been bad at school. I've always felt like I'm a little off, too much in my head etc.

I've been treating my anxiety with benzodiazepines but they make me dumb and impulsive and kinda increase my inattentiveness. Not on daily basis but whenever there's a stressful situation. Does anyone here have experience on how benzos affect ADHD? I've read that caffeine helps ADHD folks to concentrate but it just makes me worse.

I have many inattentive ADHD symptoms but I'm worried if anyone professional will take me seriously. I feel like there's something more than just anxiety but I can't put my finger on it.

Does anyone have any similar experiences or any info I could benefit from? I'm sorry if this comes off as pointless or rambly or something. Thanks!",adhd,adhd
"What is the difference between stimming &amp; tics? I started having tics when I was 4 years old. Clearing my throat, sticking my tongue out, blinking my eyes really hard, sniffing my nose repeatedly. 

When I was a teenager I had tics that made me move my neck and arms a lot. But once I became an adult a lot of the tics went away. I was never diagnosed with anything but I did have the symptoms of tourettes syndrome.

For me, tics are an uncomfortable feeling in my body &amp; if I don't do the tic the feeling builds and builds.

I'm 24 now and recently I've been doing these repetitive movements. Hitting my knuckles together usually in multiples of 4. Flapping my hands, twisting my wrists and arms, pacing on the spot, shaking my head and moving my neck. It's a similar thing to the tics I had as a child. I get that uncomfortable feeling and the only way to get rid of it is to move that part of my body. It's definitely worse if I'm feeling stressed.

So my question is, what is the difference between tics and stimming? I know stimming is more of a self soothing behaviour. Like when I'm in bed I rock myself back and forth and find it soothing.

I'm not diagnosed with autism but I had a lot of the traits growing up. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia for around 3 years so I'm also wondering whether the tics/stims are caused by my medication.",autism,autism

I've lost 3 lbs in one week. Probably because I eat about 500 calories a day and walk around 10k steps. Today I have nowhere to go and nothing to really do so I'm afraid of binging. I know my body probably really wants those calories but I'm unwilling to give them to it.

I already broke one of my rules today and I'm not happy. I don't ever eat before 2 and today I made cream of wheat and ate it at 830. I thought I'd make today a normal eating day. You know, breakfast, lunch, dinner, no calorie tracking, etc. But I'm so agitated from eating so early that I'm probably just going to fast the rest of the day. 

I'm so close to being in the normal BMI range (like 3 lbs to go) and I'm afraid that once I get there my doctor will take away my Vyvanse. But I need it to curb my hunger. I do not want to gain weight back.

"Problems with my primary care doctor and finding a psych doc to take over prescribing (a rant) I have to rant about this because I want to know that I'm not alone...Does anyone else have these issues?

1) I was diagnosed 10+ years ago with ADHD

2) On Ritalin now, and it's been great. I basically can't function without it, but I never abuse it. I owe a great deal of success to this med. Sometimes I skip doses if I want to relax or I'm on vacation

3) My primary care doctors office is making my life a living fucking nightmare by: 

-Testing me every 3 months for adherence, the first time they made me come to the office after my results came in and they told me I came back negative. They sat with me and said ""whats going on? what are you doing with the medication?"" I asked them ""did you test for meth or did you test for methalphenidate""....turns out, they tested for meth. FUCKING REALLY. I'm not even a fucking doctor. ZERO apologies from them.

-My doctor calls me every time I ask for a new script (once a month)

-My doctor constantly treats me like a criminal, asking why I skipped a few days of meds (literal opposite of a red flag)

-I moved 50 miles away from my doctors office (i have to pick up a physical script every month) and when they actually figured out how to fax it I asked them to send it to a new pharmacy near where I fucking live they told me to my face ""using multiple pharmacies? that's a red flag...."" BITCH, IT'S ALL CVS, THEY HAVE ONE SYSTEM! I actually have been using the SAME FUCKING PHARMACY for 10 years.

Anyway, my new primary care doc has asked me over a year ago to get rediagnosed by a psych doctor. I looked for 3 months and found some quack who essentially laughed at me, didn't attempt to diagnose me even though I made the appointment specifically for that, and he was 100% a pill pusher. He asked me within 5 minutes what meds I'd like. I told my primary care about it, told her to go screw because she recommended him.

I've been looking for over a year for a psych doctor and as is tradition nobody is accepting new patients. My doctors office has been an absolute nightmare to deal with. I don't understand how they can be so outrageously unsympathetic and uncaring. I was DIAGNOSED by a DOCTOR and PRESCRIBED MEDICATION, and my doctor essentially refuses to write scripts on time. But because my new primary care wants to save her ass, she's putting me through hell.

Usually I'm one for restricting with a couple of days a week at 'maintenance'. But today, well, today was something else.

So I've been to the lab in the past because the doc wanted me to get blood done; electrolytes were fine CK enzymes not so much. This freaked me out and I cut back on going to the gym and upped cals slightly, had the blood redone and levels were back within normal ranges; made me feel like shit, but also better at the same time.

I wasn't even hungry but I was on shift and people had brought in snack foods, which I'm generally pretty good at ignoring. Responsible me apparently died last night and I ate everything. Multiples of everything. Infinite foods. Like, guys... So much. This hasn't happened to me before. Not like this. I ate chips, muffins, scones, biscuits, had a roast with my oil for dinner, multiple muesli bars, jellybeans, McDonald's. Ugh.

"Talking about delusions on podcast Been rough with an episode the past few days. I've been in and out of it most of the week. Still managed to record and edit my podcast for today. While it was rough, I just had to do it. Just starting out only three episodes in now, I want to keep some consistency. I feel like if I skip a week because I'm sick, I'll fall into that rut again. I also took it as an opportunity to see what it would be like doing it in the middle of an episode. I felt like I was going to lose it a few times during the recording and I even talked a bit into some delusions I had been going through at the beginning and later toward the end with a disclaimer lol.

One of my biggest fears is the stigma, and I want people to know that yes I have delusions, yes I hallucinate, but that is not what defines me. I have plenty of opinions that are based on facts and not just something my mind makes up. I used to be terrified to talk about it, especially after losing friends and family from the moment I brought up what was going on with me. It fucking sucks, but I just got tired of being scared because it was just making me worse. I do the podcast for fun, experience, and just a way to get things off my mind even if nobody out there is listening. I do hope that somebody can take some good from it, maybe help somebody become more open minded, or be the voice that led somebody dealing with similar things to see a doctor.

I feel good about what I'm doing, and how the podcast is coming together. I wanted to share it with all of you. I have got a lot of help from this subreddit, even though I have to avoid it at times when I get vulnerable lol.

"CBD advice?  

Has anyone here used CBD for anxiety? I just got out of a week long stay in the hospital because my PTSD and Agoraphobia w/Panic disorder flared up rather severely. I get all my care via the Veterans Affairs medical system and they won't prescribe me benzo's for chronic anxiety due to the dependency issue from taking it all the time. a couple of my fellow patients recommended CBD (as did one of the charge nurses off the record) as a way to deal with the acute panic attacks I have, and that it may help lessen the overwhelming anxiety I have some days. I'm leaning towards a vape pen, or edibles, but I don't really know a lot about either. I don't want to get high so marijuana suggestions aren't helpful. Just seeking testimonials, advice, etc.

"Managed to pull myself out of a flashback Never been about to do this before. So I consider it a milestone. Was smoking pot with some close friends and I got triggered by someone recollecting their own tumultuous childhood. I could feel my muscles reacting and shifting. I started to notice how my muscles and how they tighten/relax sort of informs me mind about how I feel. It creates a sort of feedback loop where your emotions communicate with your muscles on how to either tighten or relax and how they are configured informs your mind on how you feel - thus an initial fear will make you tighten up and then your noticing how tightened up you are makes you more afraid.


 I then started to get a very vivid image of my childhood dog. I could have told you how sunny and windy it was ok that day. I remember telling my friends ""I feel like I'm being sucked into a vortex of memory."" I then realized the precarious situation I was in - it's happening. My eyes began to well up and I then told my friend talk to me about anything just stay talking to me. He began discussing DotA 2 strategies and I engaged him on the subject while trying tapping exercises my therapist taught me. I could literally feel myself fighting my own instincts and was struggling so hard. It almost felt like the physical strain of a hard workout but with my own psychology somehow. Not easy to describe! But at some point I realized I just dodged a bullet. I had successfully reversed a flashback! 


I then got really excited over my accomplishment that I got sort of manic so I had to begin doing relaxation techniques following this to regulate myself. After about an hour I was back to my normal self! I really couldn't have done this without the help of my therapist, Tom. Just thought I would share this with you guys so you know it's possible. I've lived with this for decades so I know just how hard this can be. Trust yourself and get help if possible. Good luck and I hope you all find peace!",ptsd,ptsd

"My sleep schedule wants to shift constantly. If I don't have any responsibilities or reason to wake up, I easily sleep for 12 to 15 hours, and then I will want to stay up even longer. I know that it's normal for people not to want to go to sleep and not to want to wake up, but this seems a tad extreme. I've tried to fix it in the past, but it seems like it was too much effort, and the costs outweighed the benefits.

"Am I schizophrenic? I’m 17, and I’ve struggled with depression for a long time. My childhood was pretty rough, not financially, but in a very traumatic way.

Anyways, that’s a bit of a back story. But recently I’ve gotten worse. I’m beyond majorly depressed, and starting to wonder if I’m schizophrenic. I’m worried about posting this. And the only way I can describe why is “what if they see”. I don’t believe anything is real. I think this is all a simulation. Everything. The only way to end it is to kill myself, which I have attempted. I talk to myself a lot, and it’s not just thinking out loud. It’s almost like 3rd person. I hear voices on occasion, telling me I’m worthless, and to kill myself. I’m self aware, it’s hard to describe. I would never kill anyone, but I wonder what’s actually inside people. Is it electronics, or is it actually blood and guts? I can’t keep a relationship. My ex girlfriend left me in June, and I’ve spiraled ever since. She meant everything to me.

The drink was watered down. The burger was made terribly, not nearly enough sauce so it was dry. The fries had zero salt and tasted liked they'd been fried in burnt oil. I could feel this lump in my throat, I was so disappointed. I ended up chewing and spitting most of it and eating none of it.

"Is that a sign of schizophrenia? Hi, I'm 16yo(m),
So, I'm afraid of darkness. Just like a 6 year old kid. I think it's not normal for such a teenager. 
Second thing is that sometimes I horribly fear of looking into mirror (especially at night) since I'm scared of seeing someone standing behind me (like slenderman or similar things). Every time I come back from toilet in the midnight I feel like someone is just behind me and is following me. Sometimes it happens to me when I'm coming home from school, but it's not that intense as the thing I experience at night. 
When I'm trying to sleep I often can hear a loud crack coming from my wardrobe. First I thought my furniture is old and not well mucked, but it happens even now when I've got new furniture. 
Sometimes I feel like someone is sitting somewhere in my room, but I can see him well.
Please tell me what's wrong with me, right now I'm really frightened. In addition I suspect that I have depression, yesterday I've seen a psychiatrist and I'm seeing him next Monday and I'll definitely tell him about it. On the first visit he told me that meds can help me with depression, so something is definitely wrong with me.

"How to help my friend who confided in me? Last year my friend told me that her drinking habit got out of hand and that it turned into alcoholism, drinking every day and needing it.

So I was shocked to hear because I never noticed, but yes of course we had wine when we saw each other. But I didn't know she drank daily at home.


A couple weeks ago she heard her dad is dying, horrible news of course. Now she told me that her drinking has turned to daily again and she badly wants to quit. She couldn't leave a supermarket without buying beer and drinking it all. She postponed it to first of January but still hasn't been able to do it.
Friends keep coming over, and she gets gifted alcohol with the holidays and she buys it for them. But what stays left in her fridge, she drinks. 


I'm the only one who knows. But how do I help? I told her to tell the weekly coach she has for her autism and she says shes done that. But I hear nothing about it. I also don't know if I should tell others, I mean it's a secret she told me. But her brother contacted me an hour ago telling me she's not well and if I know some thing, I told nothing but I wonder if I should confide in him.

"Illness triggered old eating habits I have been sick since the beginning of this year. I would wake up every morning vomiting and would have severe abdominal pain throughout the day, especially after eating. It's got so bad that I would get sick anytime I ate, I was hospitalized a few times, but they still can't find out what's wrong with me. I was out of work for 2 months on medical leave, but it drove me crazy being stuck at home and I was determined to take control of this and get back into life. 

I slowly started cutting out certain food groups that would really trigger my nausea or pain. I'm already vegetarian, I then cut out gluten, most sugar, and dairy. I started eating as little as I could as slowly as I could out of fear of being sick and in pain. I have slowly felt better as far as the nausea and abdominal pain goes.

I have a long history of disordered eating, and this whole situation has spiralled out of control and triggered old habits. I have a very hard time eating anything, out of fear of sickness and now of gaining weight. Ive lost a lot of weight since this began, I'm the smallest I've ever been.

"I was off my meds for 5 months. Zero Stars. Do NOT recommend. Was on Adderall, 20mg BID for two years after 2.5 decades of struggling and thinking I was just lazy and depressed. 

I lost my insurance and work was slow so I couldn't out-of-pocket it. I kept two pills in my glove box ""just in case"" out of fear something was going to come up where I NEEDED my focus back and I didn't take them when I should have because of the anxiety of not having the option to ""be normal"". This is not something neurotypical people feel. I was NOT myself.

My friendships were suffering. I no longer had the patience for them because I was not myself. I'd drive 20 minutes to hang out for an hour and have to leave because I literally could not sit and focus on the people I genuinely care about.

My romantic relationships were suffering for the same reason my friendships were. I had no energy to put in. I got depressed. I felt like the laziest, most useless pile of garbage. My self esteem tanked. I wondered why the people I love even loved me back when I couldn't give them the attention they deserved.

My work was suffering. I am an independent contractor, and I handle everything in my job from marketing and advertising, the actual job, client relations, to bookkeeping. I would neglect to check my email for days. I would then avoid because I was terrified my clients were upset (they weren't). Doing my 4th quarter taxes SUCKED. I turned down projects because I felt like there would be too much on my plate. I completely stopped continuing education when honing my craft is my FAVORITE THING TO DO. I scraped by financially because of this. 

My body suffered. I could barely even work or be social, so good luck getting me to the gym or even riding my bike. I'd lose track of time and being active wasn't even an option because I'd waste moments to the point that I would have to drive everywhere, even places less than a mile away, because there was simply no time.

Taking a break was awful. Looking back on it, I would have been better off struggling more for a bit in order to keep going to the doctor and filling my script. I would have lost LESS money in the long run. I am kicking myself for turning down huge lucrative projects, but the only thing I can do is move forward.

If you NEED your meds, please get them and take them, for your own sake. I know when you are uninsured it's literally impossible sometimes, but if there is any thing you can cut out, anything you can do at all, I highly recommend not fucking your future self over.

Spare you the details, but i had never felt so close to taking my life.

Because i had turned 29, because unemployed for 6 years, living at parents, but mostly because of the total impossibility to manage or have adhd treated after 5 years of trying. (Ritalindidn't work and it's all i can find here.)
 
Figured i might as well try something drastic so i took my car and drove from france to netherlands to attend a 3 days retreat.

I came back so refreshed, so full of love and hope. I can say without a doybt that i had gotten over my depression.

Quit smoking weed, drinking, closed my social media accounts, took a meditation habit, started to look for jobs again...

I knew it was going to be hard, but i thought i could make it.


I really thought things were starting to turn for the best when friends of mine who live in paris offered me to stay at their place to help me find a job at their company.

That was two months and ten days ago.

I am now back at the exact same place i was in november.

I'm pretty sure nothing will ever get better now.

They tell me they understand that I want justice against my dad and that's why they're there speaking to me. I need advice because they told me since all these occasions my dad had molested me there is no evidence really. They told me one way and most likely the only way to bring him to justice is for me to speak to him over the phone and try to make him admit to molesting me (this would all be done at the police station and would be recorded by the detectives). I'm thinking HOW THE FUCK AM I GOING TO DO THAT?!?! This phone call at the police station will take place soon and I'm terrified each day it gets closer. I don't know what to do! My dad is a evil, disgusting, perverted, piece of shit, child molesting, pedophile, coward, and a sociopathic narcissist. HE WILL NEVER ADMIT!!! WHY IS THIS MY ONLY OPTION?!?!

"Advice on hiding my diagnosis Hi

I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia 10 years ago. After many bad years, I finally became able to semi-manage my symptoms. I'm currently doing my Master's of science in a research direction (to paranoid to be more specific), after which I plan to work in a research post.

The problem is, I am extremely paranoid about people finding out about my diagnosis.  If people see me as a unstable and crazy, I will lose all credibility in my field. 

Even when my symptoms are under control, I still come across as a very strange person and most people realize that there is something wrong with me after a few minutes.  I have tried to manage this by simply not talking to people whenever possible.  

This year I have responsibilities that requires me to work closely with other people on a regular basis and I don't think I can hide my symptoms from them for very long.

"Doctors are suggesting my son is not autistic. Hello,

I’ve been a member here for a few years and I have read most of the things that have been posted here. My son was diagnosed with autism when he was 2.5 years old.

Now, I should mention that he also has epilepsy. His first seizure was at 9 months old and he’s had hundreds since then.

The problem we’re having is that his neurologist and neuro-psychologist are suggesting to us that he may not be autistic. Now, one way or another I don’t care what his diagnosis is, but our issue is that he acts and behaves totally different around adults versus other kids. With kids he exhibits many ASD tendencies like hyperactivity, repetitive behaviour, prefers to play alone, short attention span, no safety awareness, need for routine, and a complete lack of empathy. However with adults, he doesn’t display this way.

- I always had an oddly technical way of answering questions in class. Teachers often were dumbfounded as to how I could articulate myself and reach my conclusions. (As long as I can remember)

- Severe lack of self esteem. Weird thing of mine: I naturally sat next to the smart kids in class, because I sincerely hoped to compete on their level.  Almost like I could draw from their energy. This has hurt me considerably over the years. When you can’t focus, there is simply no amount of willpower to ensure that you do. I ruined my self esteem comparing myself to others. 

I have more, but I know very well that the longer this gets, the less likely you guys are gonna read it. (That’s how I am anyways)

Has anybody else come to a belief due to a episode if so what is it? Had a pretty bad episode last year I feel like I’ll never be the same it lasted 3 months. I lost all touch with reality I felt like everyone I knew were able to teleport and access different realities.I felt like i was watching tv in real time if that makes any sense like they performed for me at that exact moment. Also that people (friends) could enter my dog’s mind and watch me through him. That they could also be invisible and be by my side talking to me. That you could talk to anyone you wanted if you simply built a bridge from your mind to theirs. I came to the conclusion that we all have the same consciousness and our upbringing and environment is the only thing that separates us from each other. It was like a big ol cosmic joke made by us for us to figure out one day that we were all actually the same person. I still believe it to this day hard to convince myself that it’s not true from the things I’ve experienced.,schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"So I think I am pre schizophrenic So over the course of a year I notice some things about my life that does not seem normal, but never really connected the dots.

1. I have always heard voices around nothing bad a few times just random screams
2. Objects just seem to be created out of nonthing.
3. I have the feeling of bugs traveling up my body and I can feel each leg that goes along my back when i work out.
4. Some paranoia and feel like I can hear people thoughts.
5. Again not so much voices, but noises that are not real but seem like they are.

Some things about be
1. Male almost 21
2. Have an excessive amount of dopamine production (to the point where I can't be depressed)
3. Had 2 closeish death experience when I was before 10.
4. Had to dealt was real and not when I was really young (like finding out the spongebob was not real)
5. When I see someone get hurt in anyway my body naturaly inflicts the pain on myself. (I can't watch people break any body parts I be on the floor for 20 or some minutes)


So basically my symptoms seem to get worst by month, but still manageable for now.

"Taking psychedelics after being diagnosed with schizophrenia? Hi, I don’t personally have schizophrenia, but my uncle did. My father used to tell about how he(my uncle) used to use a ton of drugs like LSD and pot before developing it in his early 20s.

I am currently 17 and psychedelics have always interested me. I tried marijuana but it ended up giving me Derealization. I want to try psychedelics when I get older but I’m not sure if I’ll develop schizophrenia or not.

"I can't stand my girlfriend when she is drunk. I don't drink much and my girlfriend drinks all the time and it's really annoying. When she is drunk I can't have a normal conversation with her. She says things that make no sense at all and gets mad at me for not understanding. I will try to tell her that she doesn't understand what's going on and she will deny it and claim that she knows exactly what's happening. Whenever I try to talk she will interrupt me every five seconds and try to finish what I was saying and it's ALWAYS wrong, and I will tell her that she is wrong and she will literally not believe me and try to tell me that I am wrong about what was being said even though it's a sentence I started. It's like she hijacks my sentences and and makes them hers. If I am talking to her about something she will talk to me pretending she gets it and I will keep talking to her about it and realize that she didn't understand anything I said so I can't actually trust that she hears anything. She will also say things and when I argue with her about it she will literally claim that she didn't say something that I just heard her say thirty seconds ago and she will argue like she said something else. She also spills shit everywhere. One time we had to get up the next morning for lunch with my family and she was hungover and she tried to skip it out wait to come until later and I had to convince her to come with me(even though I warned her the night before that we needed to get up).

A lot of times I ask her not to drink or at least not to drink a lot so I can have fun with her but she always gets smashed and it ruins everything and I can't even stand being in her company. The other night I asked if she could not get super drunk and she drank lightly while we were hanging out with other people and she was pleasant to be around, not too drunk. Later in the night everyone went to bed and we were having sex and she said she had to pee And walked upstairs. I heard a glass clink while she was up there but I really didn't think much of it because it could have been water or it could have been her mother's glass or something. She certainly back downstairs and within the next half hour I realized that she couldn't understand anything and that she was saying things that didn't make sense. I thought something was wrong with her but then I realized she was drunk. I asked if she drank while she was upstairs and she said she didn't. I kept asking her about it and she claimed it was from the drinks she had earlier in the night(like two hours before she went upstairs to ""pee""). I knew it was bullshit but she wouldn't admit it. I let it go and we kept messing around for a while but  it kept getting worse and she was pissing me off and doing all the annoying things she does when she's drunk and we got in a fight about some dumb shit and It completely ruined the moment and I didn't even want to have sex anymore(which isn't normal for me, She was literally begging for it and I would usually jump on that kind of thing). Then I spent an hour watching her try to puke. The next morning I asked her about it and she finally admitted that she drank when she went upstairs to pee and she said she did it for sex. 

Lately she has been getting drunk at almost every event we go to where anyone is drinking and I ask her almost every time before not to drink too much. I'm also worried about her because I know she gets drunk like this all the time at college parties. I live far away from her and I am worried about her safety when I'm not there to watch her. 

Anyways thanks for reading all of this I just felt the need to say this to someone but what do y'all think? Am I just a boring asshole trying to ruin her fun? I'm not a fan of alcohol in general and I think it's generally damaging so maybe I am just biased? But it is really hard to be around her when she is drunk. Its pretty normal for people to be annoying when they are drunk but she is just so bad. Usually I can have a conversation with someone who has been drinking and enjoy their company but I just can't handle her in that state. If anyone has advice on what I should do then lay it on me.

"I feel like I have no one to relate to I have PTSD from my parents divorce which happened last May. They fought a lot leading up to it, but I was never involved. Most nights I closed myself in my room and cried myself to sleep listening to them yell.

I feel like no one understand what I’m going through. Divorce isn’t usually the kind of thing that gives people PTSD. I don’t have flashbacks or stuff like that. I used to have night terrors but they went away. My therapist and I talk about it sometimes. She said my main symptoms are avoidance and anxiety.

"Developing Schizophrenia? Hi,

I’m in my late 20s and I have a brother diagnosed with Scz.

I have some “sympyoms” that makes me fear I have the condition too.

1. Delusions:

Since my teenage year I’ve been through several (potential) delusions.

I feared I was gay to a point I analyzed every move I make, how I sit, how I speak, how I walk, etc.

I feared I had cancer, I was terrified for a significant amount of time and caused me severe distress.

I feared I had leukemia.

I feared I had OCD.

And now I fear I have schizophrenia (since my brother diagnosis).

Now, every time there was a trigger of some sort that lead me live these delusional states. I never believed truly that I have any of these but the fear was present and causing me to seek reassurance constantly. Mostly involving losing hours and hours on internet, forums and med sites.

It looks like there is always something that has to cause me distress eventually, now is schizophrenia. Is like I’m trying to convince myself that I’m not constantly but in the same time accept the fact that it is what it is.

Now because my brain is constantly scanning my psyche for schizophrenia signs and gives me anxiety this is what I found:

I don’t have too much appetite (since 7-8 years ago) when these “fears” started interfering with my life.
I was always a little shy. I don’t like crowds, I don’t talk too much only if it is necessary.

Don’t talk too much with my family (childhood trauma, alcohol, scandals).

I fear that I hear voices, happened few times when I was very tired and half asleep, they weren’t truly voices as in hearing them in the proper sense, they were thought-like voices chatting random things between themselves. I reckon that’s my mind, I know that my thoughts are all mine (as in from my own mind) and never experienced real-world hallucinations.

I find myself telling things to my parrents, my brothers, my friends. I just tell them stuff and I imagine what would they replay to me.
I imagine telling them things I never said, should have said or want to say.
I imagine scenarios all the time, what I would do when certain things happen, picture myself as other people, powrful characters, etc.
These are all my own things, I imagine them in purpose.

However, I cannot go past the fear of becoming scz like my brother and the random chatter that occuree kind of annoyed me.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"After some self-reflection I’m starting to realize I(22) have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I’ve always just considered myself a social drinker. I thought what I was doing was normal, but I’m starting to fear I’m losing control.

I really never drink by myself, just on the weekends, most weeks, Thurs-Sun. I hate the depression I have the next day after drinking, but I continue to do it.

I’ve ruined relationships with great women due to my drunken antics. I’ve even put my career in jeopardy twice because of alcohol.  I put alcohol above my health and passions, but I continue to drink.

I genuinely know my life would be better without it, so I try to stop, but as soon as the weekend rolls around I find myself getting plastered yet again. I guess I just normalized this kind of behavior because my friends are always drinking, but deep down I hate it. I hate the person I am when I’m drunk, and I regret drinking every. single. fucking. time.

Last time I went an extensive amount of time without drinking was about 6 weeks last August. I don’t feel as if I’m addicted because I really don’t crave alcohol until it’s time to drink socially but idk. Maybe I’m in denial, hoping I just have shit willpower.

Problem is, I can't go more than two days without a drink. My anxiety gets so unbearable, I cave in. I did a medical detox 1 month ago, but when I got out I received word that I have to move out of my house (due to lease terms, not due to my drinking.) I relapsed, and I made things worse. When I drink, I tend to rage against people. My doctor says the rage is a symptom of PTSD. In any case, the repercussions of lashing out at people make me so ashamed that I want to drink even more.

"This community makes me feel less alone. TW: Yo-yo dieting, numbers, health problems

Seriously. Thank you all so much for sharing your stories and making me feel like I’m not alone with this struggle. I have been in a very bad place lately. A few years ago, I lost 70 lbs through pretty unhealthy methods. I was really fat (size 18/20) and ppl kept praising me for my weight loss and congratulating me  on how small I was getting, but I didn’t tell anyone about the nights spent on the elliptical cause I went over my cal limit or the days which I ate nothing at all. Once, a friend asked “how I did it”. I told her, while laughing, “just don’t eat!” She thought I was joking but I was really telling someone the truth for the first time. 

Then I went into therapy for my ED and instead of recovering, I went straight into BED and literally gained it all back, plus more. I am now in a worse place than I was before mentally + all sorts of physical comorbidities related to bingeing/restricting for so long. When I was fat before, I had a healthy blood pressure and cholesterol level. After BED, I have to take medication daily to keep my BP from going so high I could have a stroke. I am a lot older than many of you, but still way too young to have HTN.

The numbers were there. This isn’t a case of fatlogic. Statistically, I was at a higher risk of cardiovascular incidents, but the numbers contradicted that. From a medical standpoint, I was in better health before I lost the weight. 

Eating disorders look different on everyone. Looking at me, you’d think I was just another fat gorl who eats pizza way too often and doesn’t care about a proper diet. Because of my size, no one can tell I have relapsed harder than before, and now I only eat a proper meal about twice a week.

Maybe this time I’ll actually lose weight, at least that’s what I’m telling myself.

"Relationships / isolation On and off meds but currently on and seeing therapist, I hold a job where I'm social. I don't disclose often to others often though sometimes I allude to various symptoms. No one ever mentions ""do you have schizophrenia?"" even when I say I'm paranoid about being poisoned, or followed to friends or dates.... but I like to allude rather than divulge due to stigma and past situations of being abandoned due to the illness.... 

I found myself really getting to know a woman online off a dating app and we met up a few times but now I haven't seen her for months. We didn't have sex ever. I probably could if I wanted to. She likes me, and She still seems excited to speak to me when I can get out of my head to reply to her even despite me cancelling many times and being distant.... I like her a lot and we have a lot in common but I get paranoid and am afraid of things progressing. I'm afraid of being rejected when I would inevitably have to plainly say ""I have schizophrenia"" -- I go on other dates with women even though I don't let any get too close to me either. I've also been paranoid eating out with the first girl, deluding myself to think she would tamper with the food. 

She's the only one who has stood out in a way that makes me think she might not judge me, but I just can't bring myself to get close although I don't want to lose her either. I find myself stringing her along hoping that I feel ""up to it"" one day. She made it clear it hurt when I cancelled a few times.... I feel horrible about this too. 

I guess I just wonder if anyone has been in a situation where they did want to be with someone, but their symptoms held them back from progressing? My therapist told me it's common and that I need to focus on self care (I had a psychosis breakdown last year when off my meds) and the rest will come naturally but I have lost women in the past because of neglect and I'm afraid it will happen again because of the paranoia, and just not feeling like I have the emotional energy. 

I don't want to be hurt. Dating new women has been a distraction but I honestly don't know why I'm not letting the one I actually like see me.

It also feels that I am confirming my ADHD as I now I need to study and learn about the healthcare system of the country I live in. I will focus on all the wrong stuff such as watching lectures and reading about the different scales and recent research but I won't do a single effort to read about how things work with medical professionals in the country I live in and how can give me a diagnosis.

FYI, I am unofficially diagnosed from a family psychiatrist. I had two appointments with her where I had to go through all the fucked up embarassing things that happened to me and I was struggling my whole life to hide them but then she just believed me. She has already talked with my family, she lives in the same neighboorhood as me and I was a classmate of her son so she doesn't question that I have ADHD/ADD but she told me that if the label is important for me then I need to do some neurobiological evaluation. My situation is complicated as where I am I need to wait in queue for long (5-6 months min) to get an appointment, so yeah I need to wait but it doesn't help me because I know all that time I will spend it on ADHD itself and do nothing else. I have no interest meeting friends, go on a date, just working enough to have an acceptable performance at work and then do my research.

Worst thing is, I feel I easily forget all that information and I don't know if it's a sign of ADHD or I am so focused on that that I analyze everything and attribute all my symptoms to that.

It's horrible, please help me.
FYI: 28F, had hints of something is wrong my whole life, but trying to hard to accept myself made me leave undiagnosed and suffer in silence. Docs that I have talked suspect ADHD-C, but I am sure I am ADHD-Pi with a comorbid disorder that causes me some impulsive symptoms. I know that my impulsive symptoms are not related to ADD cause I can't remember any of them at childhood, but I can definately remember them in adolescence. I thought however that in women it appears later and you can even have ADHD-pi and start feeling symptoms in adolescence. I am so confused and it feels that doctors don't know that much and can't answer all the question I have. It makes it even harder to continue.

"My brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and I wanted to see if you guys think it makes sense. If this post is too much to read, skip down to the line and start there. Everything beforehand is just context. 

Throwaway because I have colleagues who know my main account.


My brother has always been a little strange towards me growing up. Ever since I was a baby, he often talked to me as if I were a baby myself (not even just like a child. I mean a straight up, baby talk, gibberish nonsense kind of speech.) It was terrible and annoying for me. I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but it was sometimes all day, aggressively, sometimes he would follow me around the house and scream nonsense. Beyond this, he was a normal teenager, doing well in school, hanging out with friends, etc. He also didn't act like this towards my other siblings at all, and maybe this is because I am the youngest. He is the oldest, with two siblings between us.


 We had an extremely tumultuous childhood, with a mother who occasionally beat us and was very emotionally abusive. To him and my older sister (second in line) she was extremely strict and held them in unreasonably high standards academically. There were a lot of other issues in our house, and we have a long standing history of mental illness (anxiety, OCD, manic depression, etc). When my brother was in college and I was in HS, my mother killed herself. My father took care of us from then on, but he had his own serious emotionally abusive behaviors as well. 

After college, my brother got a job in sales, and was doing more or less okay. However, he was completely isolated and didn't have any friends after college ended. While my mom was alive, she was a fairly religious (Islam). My dad is of faith as well, however, he was never as serious as my mother was. 

After college my brother was really struggling with my mothers death. Although he wasn't religious growing up, he really turned to Islam during this time. He moved to another country (I'd rather not reveal too many details) where he could join a Muslim community and live with like minded people. This made sense to me because he was extremely traditional, and I could see that he was really unhappy here in the states. 

We were fairly low contact at this time, just because me and my siblings have all struggled with being close as we are easily triggered by thoughts of our childhood. He was living in a small community with other men studying Islam (I don't really know much of the details) and it seemed that he was still struggling there. When we would talk over the phone, which was rare, he told me that other people were treating him really poorly, that he was a misfit, etc. I would try to console him and encouraged him to maybe explore other opportunities. I understand that this was a red flag and we should have communicated more, however, at the time, I was in college and was having some seriously bad issues myself. 


It's no excuse, it's just an explanation. The next time we spoke on the phone, he told me that he was incredibly depressed, on and off starving himself (severely. Would go days without eating at a time) and that he was miserable. Eventually, he came home, after changing his mind about it dozens of times over the course of a year (he was there for 2 and a half years total). I think Islam is wonderful, and I'm really not trying to say that it messed him up or anything. I just think he was very odd and picked on relentlessly by other people for that reason. 

—————————

Fast forward to now. He has been home for about 6 months and he is just completely gone. He exclusively talks to me in a baby voice, runs around dancing in public while screaming, and will even have his ass out and run through the street. I'm not going to go into extreme detail but he is essentially an adult toddler. The interesting thing is while he can sometimes talk to other people normally, when it comes to me, he exclusively talks like a baby. I mean he TORMENTS me. It's far worse than when I was a child. I absolutely cannot stand it. 


Besides this, he can't hold a job, and he lives at my fathers house. He is constantly talking about how all that fasting 'took a part of his body.' He will constantly ask people to feel his right hand and tell them that its broken. He says the right half of his body doesn't work and he is a subhuman. It takes up his entire life. He's been to several different doctors who have assured him there is nothing wrong with him. It's constantly on his mind, and he says he can't be a normal person because he's missing something. He claimed that he digested his hip, that he got shorter, etc. 


He also has other delusions-- he claims that people with significantly arched eyebrows automatically live a better life... Things like that. A few months ago, he disappeared for 24 hours without a cell phone, told everyone he was going to kill himself, and when the police finally found him he was institutionalized for 10 days and then got out. He refuses to take medicine because it will only make his right side 'worse.' 

He was diagnosed with schizophrenia, however, he has never talked about hearing voices or believing that anyone is going to harm him. I would believe this diagnosis, but I am just unsure if it's actually true. Maybe it is. I don't know. My sister claims he is just depressed, but I think this is beyond depression. 

I can't be around him. It's tearing my family apart. My father can't sleep at night. What do we do? He refuses to get care or take medicine.

"Use to have a problem.. might again? When I was a teenager from about 13-17 I had a problem with alcohol. 
I would black out every time I drank. I was telling my boyfriend today, I can’t tell you how many times I have blacked out, but I CAN tell you how many times I haven’t. 
When I was a teenager I was dealing with a lot more than most kids should, and I think alcohol helped me forget about all that. It made me “fun” and “cool”. I am also very shy and socially awkward so when I drank I was always the life of the party. 
I would say most of the times I had sex I was probably raped. I lost my virginity to a 20 year when I was 14 because I was so drunk I didn’t know what was happening. That has happened more than 10 times. Having black drunk sex was pretty normal for me. I always hated myself the next day, but continued on. 

Now at 17 I met my now boyfriend. I quit drinking COMPLETELY. If I drank a sip of alcohol I would start having an almost anxiety attack. FROM A SIP! I didn’t want anything to do with alcohol for 3 years! 

When I was 20(I’m 22), my son was stillborn at 9 months. Immediately afterwards, I stopped being afraid of alcohol again. It makes me more depressed, but no anxiety from a sip. 
I’m blacking out again. 
I’m hating myself so much again. I’m waking up in the morning crying about how I know I shouldn’t drinking because I have no control. 
I went to my best friends birthday dinner last night and black out from wine. Wtf? I can’t even go to a dinner and be a normal functioning human being?

"I (25 NT M) need help understanding differences between autistic and BPD traits in my gf (27 f autistic) Hey everybody,   


First and foremost, let me say that the reason I'm posting this in /r/autism and not /r/BorderlinePDisorder is because, like in most areas most information on 'anything' is written according to NT standards, and therefore inapplicable to my gf, who is autistic. I also want to be clear that I am not attempting to diagnose her with BPD.   


So I am currently seeing a lovely 27 yo autistic woman and our relationship has been a rollercoaster, to say the least. I'm NT and this is my first time dating an autistic person and I am making every effort to accommodate the differences so that we get along. Most of our arguments happen because of her misinterpretation of my words, as I speak differently to what she expects (standard English). I speak with a regional accent and frequently 'misuse' words, which in delicate and tense conversations, has led to meltdowns, etc.   


Anyway, my gf is also chronically depressed and has a generalised anxiety disorder - together with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She is also extremely suicidal at times. Never to the point of acting upon it (attempts; though there have been before I was around), but suicidal ideation is constantly there in the background. Acute some days, minimal others. I try to be supportive where possible.   


The reason I'm writing this thread is that lately, a lot of her behaviors are coming across as manipulative and frantic. It's taken a huge toll on our relationship, and indeed my own mental health. I've done a tonne of research on autism (to best support her), but there are some things that she does lately that makes me wonder if there is something else. She herself admits to not knowing why - all of a sudden - her mental health is taking yet another dive. She has weeks where she is okay and gets along, whereas others where she is extremely low mood, angry, suicidal - mixed with either complete emptiness or a strong hatred towards herself and her existence.   


I'm starting to think that she may be borderline, but it is complicated because the traits of a borderline overlap with other conditions such as depression and anxiety. However, since she is also autistic, I'm not sure how to process all of the information. Here are the main characteristics of a borderline (taken from  [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/diagnosis/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/diagnosis/) ) :   


1) Intense fear of being alone causing extreme actions 

2) Patterns of intense, yet unstable, relationships 

3) Lack of strong sense of self and unclear self-image

4) A tendency to act impulsively in a somewhat destructive/damaging manner 

5) History of suicidality and self-harm 

6) Severe mood swings

7) Long-term feelings of emptiness and isolation 

8) Sudden feelings of anger and aggression 

9) In stressful situations, a tendency to dissociate and/or being paranoid  

&amp;#x200B;

Again, without attempting to diagnose her but to describe her actions as of late, my GF accurately meets at least 7/9 of the above, with only 4 and 9 being the ones that don't really fit.   


So, I think my question is, do other autistic people have these traits also? 

&amp;#x200B;

My GF needs help and is seeking therapy, though somewhat slowly and perhaps reluctantly. The reason I'm thinking about any of this is so that she gets the BEST therapy she can. If she is borderline, as well as autistic, then that will make the search for a therapist hard, but she'll need to find the right one.   


Thanks for any advice, comments, and/or suggestions.",autism,autism

Over a year ago now, July 2018, I was actively using. So was my girlfriend. Some pretty potent stuff, speed and molly myself, her too but she also used smack.

Long story short she was having trouble with her own PTSD and woke me up to talk, I did what I could for her, spending roughly two hours trying to get her to come to bed. In the end she did, but she must of gotten back up after I fell asleep. 

I dont fully know what she used, but she was gone the next time I woke up, curled up in the corner of the room,  not moving and all I could do was stare and wait to see her take another breath. 

It broke me, more than my past traumas already have. I blocked it out for a year. Never called 911. I just left back to my cousin's apartment where I had been staying for the most part. I went on a date a few days later, she was already completely forgotten. 

It wasn't until this July, 2019, a week before the anniversary, that it came rushing back. I had been clean for 10 months, and then I do a hookup and use. I go through withdrawal and back to replacing substances with cigarettes. Over the course of the past week I've gone from occasional cigarettes to just getting stoned and smoking half a pack. Seriously been considering finding someone to get marijuana from. I honestly just need to chill the fuck out.

Been hospitalized, lost my apartment, and moved to a room for rent the past week. Started a fulltime group therapy program,  and looking to return to work Friday with reduced hours.

"Got into a car accident, Im so shocked about it and I feel really anxious. The events keep coming back. Hi everyone &gt;&lt; Its my first time posting on here. I just needed someone to talk to and get this off my chest.

So today, I was driving to the vet and when I entered the round a bout, a car suddenly comes fast into our right side and slams into our car causing the side mirrors to flip. Went to the side of the road. Called the police, told them everything. 

Our car at the right side near the headlights, got damaged and we got a flat tire, while the other car had just a scratch. He was driving this huge pickup truck while my car is this tiny Yaris Toyota. 

One of the things that annoyed me the most when explaining about the incident to the police, is that, they wouldnt even look at me! They would dismiss me and tell me to keep quiet. Unfortunately, in our country we have a lot of discrimination towards women. Anyways, Im glad that my dad was there to help me.

Long story short, turns out I did nothing wrong.
 
Sorted out everything.

Right now, Im just so shaken up about this I just feel so scared and overwhelmed from all these emotions. First, I had to be brave and hold my ground. Second, I had to speak in a language that I couldnt converse properly in so it added to my already present anxiety. 

Even when driving back home, I felt so anxious, drove slowly and made sure to check my mirrors so many times. I even put down my windows in order to see clearer cause it was already dark outside and the windows are tinted. Im just so so scared and i cant seem to rest. I feel scared that someone will call me and tell me to kind of ""discuss"" this again or something.

It started with twisted versions of the memories but it grew. I feel like I'm drowning. I don't want to do anything. I have panic attacks. I freeze up so much. It's like an internalized panic attack. It's torture. One wrong brush of someone's hand or just an empty space being behind me and I tense up and I freeze. I can't do anything at that moment and the panic is rising. I can always feel it rising. I feel numb a lot. I try to avoid everything that reminds me of it. I completely blocked the person who triggered my trauma out of my life. I can't remember the whole story, I know It was 8 years ago, but still. I feel guilty for just.. feeling this way. I act self-destructive. I try to write out the story just to feel something. I look into him on facebook just to try to remember more. I want to stop remembering. I don't want to live with this. I don't want to be diagnosed with this. I'm going to go see a therapist soon and.. I don't want to be diagnosed with PTSD. I don't want my family to know that I have PTSD and there's no way around them finding out because I am under 18. And I have chosen to not see a therapist when I knew I should for.. 6 years. I can't ignore my worsening depression and developing PTSD symptoms. I don't know how to continue. I don't know how to live life like this. So how do I continue?

"I'm so fucking tired of this It's 8 pm, I haven't eaten in 20 hours. Not unusual for me but I need to eat and instead I'm procrastinating because I can't tell if eating will trigger me into purging. So I'll just...wait until I get shaky and sick and then eat something stupid which will probably trigger me into purging. And then since I've purged I may as well binge to have a really good purging session. And then probably start drinking because the alcohol will hit harder and being drunk is always better than sobriety.


I'm just so fucking tired of this. This is every day. People don't understand that I'm exhausted because I constantly have 20 different potential scenarios and obsessive thoughts about food/behaviours in my head at any given moment. Like no wonder I hate being sober because being sober for me = obsessive thinking and compulsions about food and my body.


I need help. I can't live like this anymore. It is a nightmare living inside my head and I can't do it. But I don't want to seek out help because I'm ""not thin enough"".

First dui. Started probation today to realize I actually have to quit entirely and I feel like my life is over I've been in denial about having to quit drinking for good. Was on weekly pbts for pretrial. Not so bad? I thought that's fine I can still drink just gotta cut back and try and be smart about it. Bought my own breathalyzer so I could track my levels in the mornings. Fucked up plenty on early weekend mornings but never got called in to test. Today I find out I'm on weekly random etgs... 80 hour detection no bullshit no more drinking period. Falling into a total collapse. Goodbye friends goodbye social life goodbye summer. How am I ever going to make 18 months like this. The problem is I don't want to stop. I know it's a problem and has been for a long time. I wanted to cut back stop drinking on weekdays and alone but I never wanted to give it up entirely. I know people are gonna say support groups exercise you'll find sober friends blah blah blah. I don't want that. I want my life just more control. Struggling with mental health issues too big surprise. In therapy now. Bad breakup cheating ex who sent me into a downward spiral leading up to my arrest. Want him back despite all the hurt especially now since I feel I have no support no companionship all I had was alcohol my crutch to go out put on a good face and try to have fun. I can't date now without alcohol I can't make new friends. I'm not interested in sober friends. I struggle with feeling understimulated enough as is. I feel as if I'll be totally isolated and empty for 18 months and can't face it. Idk if this is appropriate here since everyone seems to actually be trying and wanting to be sober but I don't. I know there's really nothing anyone can say that will make me feel better at this point but I wanted to get this off my chest. Without alcohol I don't see the point in living. Im no social butterfly but I need some choas and stimulation and human contact in my life or I'll go insane. Idk sorry rant sorry if it was innapropriate. I'm glad for other people who find happiness in sobriety I really am.,alcoholism,alcoholism
"Things get easier. My experience of getting better. Brief mention of abuse without getting into details (also start and end are pointed out) This post was supposed to be a rant. 
I was feeling a bit gloomy after a flash-back, but as I kept writing I started to calm down. Hence the change in the tone.

Also, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. 

Sorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. 

I guess I have improved a lot in the last year. 
I really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.

To prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.

I still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. 
It makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. 

Up until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. 
The present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.

I used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.
 
I kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. 
I didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. 

**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**

I had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. 

**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**

After I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.
Hadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.

Although comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.

Things were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. 
I was horrified at what I had done. 
I'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. 

It's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. 
I had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.

But most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.
It's not what you or your loved ones need. 
The ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. 
You can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. 

Being passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. 

It's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. 
But please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. 
 
You won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love. 
You will have suffered greatly and still been able to pull yourself back up, you can accomplish anything you put your mind to.

"paranoia I’m so afraid of people, and go out of my way to avoid most of them. They either want something from me or want to hurt me for amusement. I still do avoid them 90% of the time.
I do have a particular person I’d take a bullet for without a second thought. He’s my fiancé. We just got engaged after dating for 7 years, and he was my best friend prior. He tells me I can talk to him whenever I’m afraid (his brother has schizophrenia, so he understands) but I’m terrified I’m going to mess up.
My paranoia has eased off slightly. I used to not be able to look in mirrors or use the computer because they would watch me through it. I’d get hives and panic attacks whenever I was in public. Since getting on lithium there’s been improvement.
To help with the finances I’m pursuing college for career training to get my first real job. Before I wasn’t able to do this because the fear would cause vomiting episodes.

"Scaring yourself into eating more Background *** 23F - I’m a chronic high restrictor and only purge when I feel uncomfortably full. I was diagnosed four years ago and have been on/off recovery throughout. 

I’ve lost quite a bit of weight again recently and most of my clothes aren’t fitting anymore. I force myself to avoid scales because it helps me focus on other things in my life. Knowing my weight would make me spiral and get me sent straight to a hospital. 

Guessing from how my clothes are fitting (I knew my weight in a previous relapse) the comments I’m receiving from others, and my questionable period, I’m likely right at the breaking point between good and not-so-good. 

For the past few days, I’ve been noticing some bad signs and side effects. 

I was born with heart issues - most have been corrected through surgery but I still have issues with arrhythmia. My ED behaviors exacerbate these problems.

Today was bad in particular. I was walking around stores with my BF and felt absolutely terrible. My heart rate was really low and irregular despite walking consistently and I felt like I was going to faint. 

I had my regular amount of food earlier in the day, but it feels like shit is catching up to me?? 

Anyway, I came home in the evening and ate at maintenance. The heart issues didn’t subside and I got kinda scared.

So then I decided to eat probably 3/4 jar of cashew/peanut butter with crackers. Some might consider it a binge, but I chose to do it believing it would be good idea since I was having cardiac issues and feeling fainty earlier. 

Maybe I can consider it damage control??

I feel better now and my heart isn’t acting as funny, but I haven’t eaten that much in a long time. It’s hard to stay calm about it. Im way over maintenance now and feel bloated. 

I’ve done things like this before. Like - ED-related symptoms start getting bad...then you try to fix/make up for it by eating more and therefore freak yourself out???

Looking for empathy, stories...maybe advice??

"I think yesterday I had a seizure on Day 3 of deciding to be sober. So I had worked out and felt really great after 2 horrible days of no sleep except for 30-45 increments of horribly vivid nightmares. I'd wake myself up because I'd yell or shout or scream out loud in my sleep. But still I was staying strong (still am) then about 20 hours ago, I'm in Walmart getting salads and healthy food, ya know? Cause I want to replace bad habbits with healthy choices. Anyway, I'm scanning the aisle for a healthy vinaigrette with no  issues, feeling fine, when my neck starts to turn and its like I can't stop it. I know it's happening but my muscles aren't pulling it back straight. I felt like the exorcist. Also my eyes start flicking to the right then back to center over and over again. This lasted about 10 seconds before I felt myself falling, not a hard fall, but I knew the lights were going out. Next thing I know I'm getting up in a different aisle, my carts gone, and I have a prick in my finger with a bandaid over it. Maybe they were testing my blood sugar? Anyway the memories are hazy as to what happened. My cart was gone so I grabbed a couple things and checked out then went home on the train and finally got 6 hours of beautiful nightmare free sleep.

"Am I out of line...? So I have no idea where to put this, if it doesn’t fit here, please let me know where I can turn to.

I’m at a loss. I truly fucking am.

So I don’t have schizophrenia, my brother does. (Schizoaffective disorder I should say, so similar but not 100% same) my whole life, my mom had my older sister and I try to understand our brother. His illness makes him see the world as a triangle when it’s an oval, his logic isn’t the same as ours, etc. it was the easiest way for our mom to explain this to us as a nurse, but my brother was a baby in the 80’s, so it’s not like people knew exactly what it was or how the mind worked.

Well, my mom died and the family fucking fell apart. I’ve tried and tried and tried to be understanding, not judge, but it’s like without Mom to act as a buffer, my brother became unhinged. I feel awful for thinking this way but it is! 

My brother doesn’t like to take his meds because of how they mess him up, so he drinks “to quiet the voices” (his words), now that’s all fine and dandy, he’s an adult. What isn’t fine is that he gets abusive when he’s drunk, and it’s bad enough that even when he stops, he becomes what’s called a “dry drunk”, where your brain is still similarly affected as when you’re under the influence. So impaired, short tempered, argumentative, etc. I basically said that I talked to my therapist, we agreed I needed space. I know he’s hurting since our mom died less than 6 months ago, but I’m grieving too.... yet some of his exact words to me when I sent that was “I DONT CARE WHAT YOUR EX THERAPIST SAID! YOU’RE CRAZY AND NEED HELP!” (This was my current therapist btw, not ex) he went on and on for an hour making a lot of wild accusations that made no sense, said a lot of things he knew would be hurtful, and specifically called me a spoilt brat (a trigger of mine, he knows it’s my biggest fear to be seen this way and have been very suicidal after moms passing. Seems super dumb know that I wrote that out....) 

Time passes, I’m guilted into talking to him by my entire family basically and think I’m in the wrong. But deep down I couldn’t forgive some of the things he said. Sure he apologized, but it felt... targeted. Like he was trying to instigate something and I feel awful for thinking that way. 

Earlier today he was arguing about me aiding with my sister. I kept trying to say I didn’t want to argue or choose sides, and he said “I’m not arguing or making you pick a side” after literally asking me if I was “defending” her. Am I out of line for just... not wanting to be around him at all? Or to just not talk to him? Every time I voice a frustration the first response is “oh he’s mentally ill he didn’t mean it/didn’t know what he was saying”. He’s fucking 40!! I’m in my 20s!! Yeah mental illness is fucking awful but it doesn’t mean you’re not sentient and can’t see how you hurt people..... right? 

I’m so sorry if I come across as judging or am saying the wrong words, I can take this down no problem if I’m out of line.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
"Regarding BAER test I need some help in making a decision for my 3.5 yr old son who is advised for BAER test. This involves IV and Anasthesia and it will help diagnose if he has any hearing loss.

My son was diagnosed with Autism when he was 2. Since then we have attempted Audiology test twice and he doesn't want to co-operate. The Doctors, the small room kind of scares him. Hence they are recommending BAER test.

In a normal day my son doesn't seem like he has trouble with hearing but at times he doesn't turn up when you call him and we were thinking he is doing selective listening as he is more interested in what he is currently doing rather than focussing on what I want him to do.

Also last 18 months he is getting ABA, speech therapy, OT, special school with extended day. On top of this he gets screen time and we speak to him all the time. But he hasn't picked up a single word. He does make noise and the same noise when he wants something or frustrated or sleepy or hungry or thirsty. We just have to try all the options before I guess the right one.

So my thought was and only because I have seen many gifs and videos on Reddit when the kids are so happy to hear their first words by using a hearing aid. I was wondering if my son also falls under that category (somewhat) and I will not be doing justice if I do not offer him this benefit of doubt just because I feel it will be painful for him when he undergoes the test.

I request parents of autistic kids or kids who are now adults with autism, based on your experience what may be going on with my son, why is he not able to speak or imitate words. Will this test lead me to somewhere or is there another test that can be done to see why there is no speech? 

He does understand few words like shoes, jacket, cap etc but I am not sure if he understands them as objects with the sound of those words. If I ask him to bring the 'ball' to me he never takes those instructions. So my concern is if he never hears or understands the word ""ball"" or ""bring"" or ""here"" then how can he speak those words.",autism,autism
"I might be on the spectrum, but what do I do now? I'm 17 years old, female, and currently a freshman in college. I've been going to CBT therapy for social anxiety since early fall of last year.

So, a story my mom always likes to tell people is how I learned to read when I was 3 years old, without any external help. I also hadn't learned any real social skills at that point outside of gibberish. Basically, I learned to talk after I learned to read, and even then I didn't really talk much. When I entered school, my mom says that my friend would talk for me and lead me around. My mom didn't see any concern with it though.

I recently learned about Hyperlexia, which basically describes that to a T. Precocious reading skills far earlier than expected without training and underdeveloped social skills. I brought this up to my therapist, who I've talked to about the prior things before, and she felt it was pretty accurate as well. She also commented on how it's not a sole-diagnosis and mentioned ASD. But she didn't say anything specific on it. I know a therapist can't diagnose autism, so I assume she couldn't make any conclusions. However, it stuck in my head, and before I knew it I was heavily researching the possibilities and talking about it with my mom and my friend and BF. I brought it up to a HS teacher of mine who I keep in contact with, and he said that he had figured that was the case since he first taught me. He elaborated why, and as I continued to research more on autism and how it presents, he might be correct. 

I assume it would be level 1/high-functioning? But I'm not officially diagnosed, and I'm always scared to self-diagnose myself. Everything seems really accurate, especially when it comes to my social skills. But if it is the case, is it really worth it to get professionally diagnosed? I'm already in college, it's not like my childhood development can be aided at this point. Should I just keep it in mind to understand myself better, or is it a good idea to seek a diagnosis? I'm lost on what to do.",autism,autism

Married 5 years. Ok marriage. Ups and downs. I think a lot to do with me, but I think there are some things my husband has never dealt with also.

He did something a month ago sexually that completely broke me and my trust in him and just how I see him. I don’t want to be in the same house as him or touch him or have him touch me. 

Been staying with an understanding friend for a month off and on. Not even every night. Basement entrance, leave them alone. Just threw them 200 for the trouble.

I know she doesn't mean it when she flips out, but I have to restrain her because she might hurt herself, jump in front of traffic, or I don't know.

We are so ashamed of letting that happen to us again. I just got really sick and couldn't work for six weeks, then i got a job delivering pizza, but my car broke.

Whenever I drink I black out and I think that the médecines really do affect me. I was sober for 3 moths and now this hit me in a new low. I know I will take it as a lesson but I woke up with bruises on my head and legs and I am so depressed I hope it passes.

Worst thing is that I actually drove home, I don’t recall driving and that’s worrying me so much , no scratches on the car but I’m being paranoid that I hit someone.

When do people like us ever learn, I always say this will serve as a lesson but then I do it again. Are some people prone to blackouts?

"""Helpful"" Comments Nothing pisses me off more than hearing from people who have never had anorexia about how to best deal with it. Like, I've been hospitalized. I'm in therapy multiple times per week. I go to a group therapy session twice a week. I've been dealing with it for five years. Sometimes I'm good and my BMI is normal. Lately it's not and I might have to go back to in-patient. It sucks. I hate it. But one thing that's getting to me today is condescending people who don't have any idea what it's like. 

Not once in years have I ever gotten good advice from a random person who stopped to comment on how thin I am. That's happened to me more than once. ""Eat more"" is a big one. Great advice! Ugh. Not once have I ever gotten good advice from someone who wasn't someone I knew in my real life, a medical professional, or someone who's dealt with the same problem. 

In another subreddit, a girl posts pictures of things she cooks and someone responded by calling out her post history, saying her behavior is unhealthy, that she has an eating disorder, and that people shouldn't be encouraging her to continue her unhealthy behavior. It was honestly terrible and stupid advice. It was shaming for no good reason. Should she not be allowed to participate as she chooses, within the guidelines, because someone wanted to stalk her history and call her out publicly?

But please, person with no history of anorexia, please tell me how I didn't approach the issue the right way. You're right. Being rude, telling the poster she's toxic, and saying you don't care what she does -- that's how to help someone get healthy. Literally all I said was that the original commenter who linked OP's other posts, including a picture of her (and the poster called her emaciated), was wrong and inappropriate. That the OP had the right to post and it might be helpful for her to do so. That cooking is something that helps me. That they don't know her medical history or what's good for her. 

I've been cooking since I left the hospital because it's one way for me to keep dealing with food. It helps. I eat more than I would otherwise. I take a lot of pictures of food to send to my friends and boyfriend because it makes me feel good to share it. Who cares if you get validation that way? Are you not allowed to because you have an eating disorder? I don't get it. If she'd been a normal weight, would anyone have had a problem with her behavior, called her out on it, linked her threads, made comments about how she looks?

I hate seeing people bully people with eating disorders -- any EDs -- thinking it's going to help. It only makes things worse.

"What does AA consider a relapse? So I’ve been doing really good for about the last month or so. Tuesday would actually be 30 days sober for the first time in over 22 years .

Just me watching some tv and doing laundry 

As much as I would like to say that I enjoyed it I really didn’t but was just really curious to see how I would handle it.

"How to actually take my meds?! I have been prescribed psych meds that make me incredibly hungry. As in, eat for three hours and I'm still starving. Naturally the side effects list ""weight gain."" Wonder why.

I am also terrified of eating, gaining weight, being fat, consuming too many calories. Etc. I have EDNOS so it's not like I have a lot of room to gain weight before I slip into complete despair. 

What will happen is: I get really depressed. As in, looking up exit bags, staying in bed crying, completely lethargic. I cant handle it so I take my meds.

My meds help a little. And then I start getting hungry. I gain weight because I lack the self discipline to just say no to fucking food when I feel like I'm starving.

Gaining the weight makes me so anxious I stop the meds.

Then I get cripplingly depressed again. 

And the cycle starts over with me taking the meds. Only to later stop.

Has anyone managed to stay on their psych meds and manage the hunger? I've mentioned this to my psychiatrist and he disregards it. ""Yep, those are the side effects, anyways...""

"Panic over things not related to traumatic events I don’t understand why low flying jets cause my fight or flight response to kick in with a vengeance. I’m not a veteran and the events that caused my PTSD have nothing to do with jets or similar sounds. When they fly low over my house it’s loud it shakes my house. My anxiety gets so bad I start to see stars and feel like I’m going to pass out. I ran to the closet at one point yelling. My tiny anxiety ridden dog didn’t even care. It will be happening all weekend and I guess it’s supposed to get louder and last longer.

"Scared Of Using Alcohol Like My Mother and Grandmother Had I grew up witnessing female figures in my life abuse alcohol to subdue unwanted feelings. Mostly my mother. In the last year she had an episode of relapse that shook me to my core. My grandmother died of due to her alcoholism that took priority over her medical issues. I’ve been fearful of drinking since I was a teenager because I never wanted to end up like that. However,  I did struggle with a cutting issue in college and high school. Firstly when my uncle hung himself, then my cousin drowned himself using cinder blocks. In college I cut awhile after my church friend committed suicide just a dorm away. I’ve stopped that and have transformed my life since. I had a really a bad breakup around that time. I’ve traveled around Europe, southern U.S, moved around and settled in south western Arkansas, 25 hours from my original home. I have an amazing boyfriend and nice apartment. I want to marry him and have a family. I’ve never been happier with someone. However, I’ve been dealing with things using alcohol. It started gradually after a long day. However, recently I’ve started graduate school and have not been getting call back for jobs. I feel like a failure, which I know I shouldn’t. I don’t want to cut anymore, so today after submitting a project incorrectly (which I know is minuscule) I tried hard not to cut and instead drank Vodka. My ancestor’s drink of choice.  I had to stop studying for school because of how hard it all hit me. I fight off alcohol cravings a bit so I’m still a “light weight” I suppose. I’m home alone most of the day, cooking, cleaning, applying for jobs and sewing the day a way. My insurance is going to end soon so I don’t think I can afford a therapist anymore. I love working, but been denied even a Home Depot Clerk job. I’ve been feeling like a failure and a loser when I’m sober recently. It’s all me. This has nothing to do with people around me or my family anymore. My mother has changed her life and is my biggest role model. I don’t have a lot of friends here yet so maybe I just need a wider support system. Does anyone have any advice? I’m scared to tell my mom what’s going on because you’d think I’ve learned from watching her drink herself to sleep and struggle during my childhood. I love my boyfriend so much as well and don’t want to mess this up. He had a very similar situation with his own mother. We have such a cute little family with my dog. It’s the morning time and I’m hoping this intoxicated feeling wears off by the afternoon when he gets home. I can’t keep a secret from him so I’ll probably tell him what happened.

It is detailed and I don’t want to trigger anyone, if your ptsd surrounds suicide maybe skip this. It hits me like a ton of bricks. It feels like I'm back at that day, the worst day of my life. I remember every part of that day. The day the world came crashing down around me. As I sit here and type this, all the images come to my mind. There's nothing I can do about them.

""If I had just found a different way to talk to him"" I know he was drunk, again. And I also know that he had pulled this stunt before, just not for real. ""I'm gonna do it"". But he never did, he just sat in the basement to make me upset. This time was different. Why didn't I just try harder? Why couldn't I tell it was going to be different this time? Sure it sounded like every other time, but still, I could've stopped him right? I can't shake the words he said to me before he did it. ""You'll regret everything you've said"". Those could have been his last words to me. My own father. Too drunk to care. The flashbacks are almost too real. When I went downstairs to find him there on the floor with a cord around his neck. I put my hand on his chin and lifted his head thinking he was still pretending. Until his drool got on my hand and his head snapped back down due to the tightness of the cord. I called my mom for help. Even she thought he was still pretending because of all the other times he said he was going to while blackout drunk angrily screaming at me. ""He's just messing with you Jaylee"". But he wasn't. I yelled up the stairs for her to come down. She didn't know what to do. I watched her struggle to untie the cord, she couldn't. She had to run back upstairs to get some scissors. When she was ready to cut the cord I didn't know how to support his fall, I tried to hold him up by standing in front of him and holding his shoulders. I couldn't. He was too heavy. I dropped him and he hit his head on the floor. I had my mom help me pick him up onto my lap. And screamed for her to call 911. While she was calling all I could was sit there, my limp, lifeless father in my lap. He was a blueish color and breathing extremely heavy. But, he was BREATHING. His dead weight was so heavy. And the cord marks on his neck are burned into my mind. I remember just whispering ""I'm sorry"" and ""I love you"" over and over as my tears fell from my eyes onto his cheek. My mom told me that the lady on the phone said to place him flat on his back so he could breathe easier. The police and paramedics came. I could hear the sirens coming down the road. I had to fill out a police statement talking about what happened while they hauled my dad into an ambulance. My mom sent me to a friends house while she went to the hospital. I couldn't bare to see him. I remember my mom telling me the doctors didn't know why he hadn't woken up yet. She told me that we might have to pull the plug if he doesn't wake up soon. He did wake up. But he was all drugged up and in diapers. He couldn't even dress himself. I remember going to see him in the hospital. His speech was slurred. But he managed to spit out ""I love you Jaylee"" I held in my tears and my words as hard as possible. They made me hug him. I broke when I got to the waiting room. That was the last time I saw him for about a month. He was in Concord for a while. The important thing to know is, my dad didn't do this because he was depressed. He did this because he was drunk. When he got drunk he wanted to get ""revenge"" for no reason. When he was drunk he wasn't my dad. I didn't know who he was. The worst part about that? He was always drunk. You'd think he would get better after almost dying right? Wrong. But maybe I'll explain that some other time.",ptsd,ptsd

"At what point does a bad memory become PTSD? Preface: sorry, your sub probably gets this all the time. I have chronic migraines, anxiety, and depression so I follow those subs and see similar questions there quite frequently... But this has been on my mind for 6+ months now so I'm hoping your community can give me some advice/support. 

At what point does a really bad memory of a situation become PTSD? I don't feel like going into the extreme details of mine, but I will say that every time I visit my boyfriend's house (drive down his Street, park in his driveway, open his door, cook dinner at his place, sit on his couch....) or any time we are intimate, the bad memory comes to the forefront of my mind. Yes, it has to do with infidelity... I haven't been able to climax during any type of sex since that day (other than by myself, and that's been like a handful of times). 

I have gotten to the point where I'm no longer worried or untrusting with him. I don't compare myself to her consciously, but I know I do it subconsciously all the time. I can't seem to stop myself. The smallest things remind me of her and that moment and the words that were said. It took a really long time but I know this situation is now about me and my subconscious thoughts than anything else (aka nothing to do with him anymore). 

Is this PTSD? I have had a number of panic attacks over it, at least that's what I've been calling them. Or is this just a bad memory I can't move on from? Are there techniques I can use to cope until I find a therapist? I was seeing one up until that night. But he actually scolded me for my response so I stopped seeing him because I didn't feel comfortable. I haven't found anyone in my town taking new patients since then. Not sure what to do. Are online therapists even real? Sorry for all the questions. I just can't let this memory of her run my life and everything I do.",ptsd,ptsd

"Just been diagnosed I will apologize in advance if my thoughts are all over the place. 

I was diagnosed literally a few hours ago. I left the psychiatrist’s office pretty disappointed and confused. I went in thinking he’d confirm my suspicion of Borderline Personality Disorder (I’m impulsive, moody, depressed, I dissociate and my personal relationships are a mess), and I believed my extreme lack of motivation was caused by the depression.

To be honest, the image I had of a person with ADHD was that of an uncontrollable kid who could not stand still. But the past few hours have been eye-opening. Everything makes sense. Every. Single. Thing. Just last week I was having a conversation with my cousin about my terrible memory, and how I would forget things in a split second if something else caught my attention. Two days ago, my boyfriend was accusing me of ignoring his texts, and I was trying to explain to him that I would honestly just forget to reply, even if I kept reminding myself to do it (something he obviously took as a cheap excuse) 

This is actually the second time I hear about having ADHD. 4 years ago, I was prescribed Adderall because I could not concentrate or get myself motivated. But at that time, I went into the office with the intention of making him prescribe Adderall to me. So, even if I was truly struggling, I felt like I had staged and exaggerated my symptoms to “make” him believe I needed Adderall. At the end of that visit, he briefly mentioned ADHD to me, I didn’t take it as an official diagnosis, completely dismissed it, and did not give it a second thought. (I stopped using Adderall soon after because, even if it did help get stuff done, the crashes would leave me completely miserable. The downs were just too down for me.) 

Well, forward 4 years and I’m in my 6th year of college and I just failed one of my two classes. I spent two weeks in isolation to get rid of distractions and finally catch up on work. That did not happen. Two weeks completely wasted. Two weeks with the same 50+ tabs open on my browser. TWO. WEEKS. 

I consider myself a smart person. I always excelled in school, but I never had to study. I thought college would be the same, boy was I wrong. These have been the 6 most miserable years of my life. It has just been a constant battle and it’s frustrating because I know I am capable of doing such great things. But instead, I am here not being able to get myself to do anything. I just stare mindlessly at blank pages, at presentations, books. I pushed back my degree another year because I couldn’t get myself to focus. 

It’s awful. But now I somehow feel relieved (?). To know that there was something off all along, it wasn’t just that I was too lazy. Now I’m just excited to see how treatment will help me. 

Edit: Was I supposed to put a TL;DR? lol

Trapped in a body that won’t cooperate
I watch in horror as i push you away

I've been told this disorder fucks up my brain
Making rewards that are instant seem like an emergency,
Than those that are longer no matter how plain
I can want, i can need, but to no avail nothing gets done, and i scream internally.

So i take my drugs at an attempt for normalcy
But i just become detached and ravage anything in front of me
It is still hard to focus on what is needed
No matter how many times i've begged and pleaded.

At the end of the day my brain is left empty
The need for completion satisfied, even if nothing got done.
I cease wanting to do anything, and thoughts just don't come.
I could say im a zombie but that isn't quite true, as with anything there is a dichotomy.

That last stanza is terrible but i've stopped caring
My only goal is to help you understand,
To help ME understand
Just what the fuck is wrong with me.

I am never sure what is me and what is the medicine
I believe that blaming my disorder cripples me
But i also know that pretending im normal just makes me depressed

&amp;#x200B;

I am nearing the 1 year mark from the last hallucination. Within a month, I am seeing my psych and working with her to lower my dose of Latuda (currently 160mg/day). I have already eliminated the small dose of Haldol that I had gone on a year ago due to the hallucinations.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that everyone is probably sick of hearing it, but I really do believe that this is all because of changes to my diet. I have been following a paleo/primal version of keto since April 2018. I dropped 40lb, lowered my cholesterol, and am getting better with regards to my psychosis. I specify that I follow primal because it means that I don't eat vegetable oil or any other unnatural foods. I typically eat tuna &amp; sardine salad made with avocado oil mayo for lunch. So, I am covering all my bases by increasing omega 3 as well as eliminating processed food.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as exercise goes, I run long distances at a low-effort level. This took time to get to a reasonable pace and had to start out simply by walking to maintain the target heartrate that I follow (180-my age: 147bpm).

"My mother is an alcoholic My mother is an alcoholic and I really don’t know what to do. I’m 20 and I have a few more months at home before I move out. But I can’t stand it.

"Threatened with hospital So I have been denying that I have a problem for some time.

I've also been denying anorexia because I'm not technically underweight. I'm 66kg and 180cm. I don't see a problem. My gf is worried. My friend has offered me free training in order to get me to agree to a meal plan (I've been wanting to tone for a whole because I lost 62kg and prior to developing an ED had asked him about training).

My doctor is great and kind and wonderful and said to me that she acknowledges that I'm about to start my career and that hospital treatment is not practical but she needs me to commit to stopping losing weight or else it won't be a choice and she'll essentially force me (I tbh needed to hear that). My gf generally eats dinner with me and will eat a slightly larger portion or have seconds so that I'll eat. Feeds me snacks while driving. Calls me on my lunch break to make sure I've eaten. She's a fucking angel and she agrees with everything the doctor said. And she has been very vocal about how she would never force the hospital on anyone because of her own experiences.

"NSFW New Here, Felt Like Sharing My Story. I (F24) have recently been diagnosed with PTSD caused by a 5 year abusive relationship with my now ex. Having a shitty day and feel like venting/telling my story. Thankyou so much anyone who reads. I've found this subreddit so helpful and supportive! 

Il try and keep things as simple as I can. I met my ex when I was 18 years old at University. He was my first proper boyfriend, I was recovering from an eating disorder at the time and was not mentally in a good place. My ex was already an alcoholic and I was naive and had no confidence. 
The relationship was unhealthy and dramatic from the start and as the years went on, things only got worse. 

My ex was a binge drinker mainly. He would drink nothing for days/weeks/months at a time but as soon as he touched drink he couldn't handle himself. He often  drank for days on end and would continually wake up, drink and then pass out again repeatedly. Meanwhile his behaviour would become worse and worse. 
During this time, I had no friends and limited contact with my family who had no idea what was going on. I always covered for him. 

(NSFW!!) He was a complete monster after a few drinks. It was like he was allergic to alcohol, it sent him insane. He would send me out alone at any hour of the day or night to buy him booze and threaten me until I did. He would take my phone to stop me having any communication, lock me out of the house or inside. He used to scream and scream at me for literally days, the most hurtful combination of words he could come up with.  He loved to watch me cry and taunted me. The violence began very slowly at first but by the end of our relationship he was hitting me multiple times a week. He has kicked me, spat on me, punched and slapped me, dragged me round by my hair, strangled me, bit me, tried to kill me, headbutted me and so many things I couldn't list them all. He  would also attack his own mother, nothing was off limits.

It broke my heart. I felt like a piece of shit and was so embarrassed. Nobody knew what was going on, other than myself and his family, who always covered for him. He was violent and nasty to me when drunk, so I stayed as I believed I could help him to become sober. I had to stop him killing himself many times, I ran in to moving traffic to pull him out, I stopped him from slitting his throat/wrists hundreds of times. I was at a loss of what to do. I called police/ambulance a dozen times, persuaded him to go to therapy/support groups/AA. 

I finally left at the end of last year. He was arrested for beating me up badly one night and was lucky to not end up in prison. After this incident, he went straight back to drinking after making false promises and I realised there would be nothing that would scare him into sorting his life out. I know he would have ended up in prison for murder if I hadn't left. 

Anyway I fell in love with a man from work, who I confided in and he admitted he has feelings for me too. I realised that not all men were like my ex and that it was possible to be happy. I also couldn't bear anymore pain from him, I prayed that I wouldn't wake up ever single morning. I am extremely lucky to now have a wonderful gorgeous man who is the complete opposite of my ex. Who actually cares about me and is my absolute rock.

 Im still taking life one day at a time. Today I feel like all the painful memories are overwhelming. I wish I could turn my head off sometimes.

I started doing exposure therapy and it worked, though it was incredibly draining. I eventually stopped because life got in the way (a breakup, then finals, then I moved). I meant to put it on hold and come back to it but I never did.

I convinced myself I was probably over it and that I shouldn't give it more attention because I'd talked about it in quite a bit of detail. But I'm not over it, I think about it every day. And I mean every single day. I feel like I'm carrying a poisonous secret.

My therapist is on vacation right now and I'm psyching myself to talk about it again when he comes back. I know I need to do it, but it hurts just to think about it and I want to keep putting it off indefinitely even though I know that's a bad idea.

There's also a little voice in my head that still blames me for what happened. I had a crush on my abuser and I didn't even register it as abuse at the time, but I remember subconsciously having my guard up when I was around him because I thought he might do something to me again. Why did I keep seeing him after what he did to me? That's one of the things that makes me ashamed to talk about it. I feel guilty.

At this point I'm just musing, so thank you if you've read up until this point. I feel really alone.",ptsd,ptsd
"Any low-functioning autism success stories? Hi all,

Whenever I read a story online about a person diagnosed as autistic making an accomplishment, I dig a little deeper into the story and see that their diagnosis was labeled as high-functioning.

I am not trying to take away anything from their accomplishments, but honestly there is a night and day difference between a high-functioning and low-functioning person with autism. When I have interactions with high-functioning individuals in a general group, they are not noticeably different than the whole and sometimes, particularly in the case of some symptoms of Asperger's, it can be an added benefit in certain roles such as intense obsession with details and procedure. 

I wanted to ask the group if they had any success stories for a low-functioning individual that they could share or link to. 

Sometimes I feel that it is a disservice to call this diagnosis as a spectrum, because when autism-spectrum disorder is mentioned in these success articles, it can lead to an unreasonable hope for parents as a higher-functioning child has less of a gap to cross (to integrate into society) than from the other side of the spectrum.

"Mom of 2 year old with autism, balancing life, where to go from here? (Help, advice please) (TLDR: Should I continue going back to school or will it be a waste of time if my son who is nonverbal and severe on the social scale and may not become independent in the future?)

Hello everyone,

My 2 year old son has been diagnosed since April. He is diagnosed as severe on the social scale. We have had a grueling time getting his ABA started because our health insurance ""accidentally put a hold"" on his request and hadn't noticed until I called and now in August I barely gave ABA our availability for them to create a schedule.

I work part time right now 1 day on the weekend on 1 night shift during the week. When he was getting testing, with all the appointments and stress I decided to cut back my hours. Talking to other moms I've realized that I'm not the only one who needs help balancing everything from cooking, bathing, cleaning, working, play time, taking him to his day care 3 times per week, etc...

I decided to go back to school taking online classes in order to help us have a better life, because I don't have a college degree. What I am wondering here is, do you think it is a waste of time? I know that once he turns 3 years old he will go to more school in the public system called Early Intervention, but I'm starting to question whether I should continue spending time and energy going back to college. I know it couldn't necessarily hurt, but if my son is not going to be independent and will need me, I wonder if I will be able to use my degree or if I will just be at home as his caretaker.

I understand there are some jobs that allow you to work from home or are part time so of course there is hope.

Obviously I know I cannot predict the future and neither can you, and I don't want to be a pessimist, I just would like to know what your perspectives are and your experiences with your children and their needs as they grow up and how that coincides with your work schedules. I am not one that ha a lot of money for babysitters and even if I did, I do want to care for him and wouldn't want him to be with a babysitter all the time.

For example: I don't have aphasia in the sense that I can't understand what others are saying but often while thinking or sometimes reading my mind will mix up words in my head. I was just thinking about what I want for dinner, and instead of saying dinner I said lunch. This happens maybe a few times a day or a week.

My classes are structured so they start at 2pm which allows me to sleep in after the drinking the night before and get some homework done in the morning.

"Found a way to get caffeine, protein, and never be constipated. 
I was at CostCo and found this protein powder, it's coffee flavoured, made with actual coffee, has caffeine, low carb, not crazy high on calories, and has 3g of MCT oil per serving which on top of helping me feel full has also ensured I will likely never be constipated again.

If you try it I do suggest working up to a full serving as the MCT oil can be rough at first.

I really love this protein powder, I know there are huge gaps in my nutritional intake thanks to my terrible relationship with food and being vegan, getting a sufficient amount of protein every day has made me feel so much better.

This has also replaced my normal morning cup of cold brew, I even have started adding a little splash of almond milk creamer in chocolate mint.

TL:DR - Rave: I found a delicious protein powder with caffeine that also keeps me from being constipated.
Rant: it is really delicious but the MCT oil will make it impossible to be a more than a couple feet from a bathroom until you get used to it.
Also, It appears to only come in coffee flavour so that can be a negative if you don't fancy coffee.

"Can my husband's drinking be causing a Hypoglycemic Rage? My husband is a type Ii diabetic it who for years and was a drinking alcoholic.

Thankfully he is now clean and sober for almost 8 months.

I was watching Doctor Oz and saw a segment about hypoglycemic rage being used as a defense in a murder case.

"How can I help my son? Hi there,

My son is 8 y/o and in 1st grade. He has Autism and ADHD and is an all around great kid. One major challenge for him is communication. He can talk but his mind races so fast I think it's a struggle for him to get out coherent thoughts especially when he's excited. He does a lot of stimming and echolalia.

He's been upbeat and happy for his entire life. When my wife was taking him to school the other day he mentioned wanting to play with friends but not having any. We tried to talk to him about it after school but we got back a scripted response that was unrelated. 

Today when my wife was dropping him off he said he didn't want to play outside because the other kids are mean to him. I don't think he's being sought out and harassed but I think when he tries to integrate with other kids he's being rejected.

I'm choking up just writing this. He's such a sweet, loving kid. It kills me that he feels rejected. I knew these days were coming but I was hoping it would be further down the road. Can anyone offer suggestions? I know there isn't a magic answer to have him fit in but I want him to feel good about himself no matter how others view him.

"I have a GP appointment booked for this Thursday (a rant) ... and eugh, I don’t even know how I feel about it. A couple of days ago I confessed my weight to my mum (the appointment was already booked) and she told me not to do cardio until I get the heads up from a professional when I’m more of a healthy weight, in case I have a heart attack. I agreed, because I love her and she said it would make her worry less about me, but I feel so lost without running. I’m still allowed to do weight training which is good but still.

I’m shitting myself for this appointment. and I feel so conflicted, because part of me is like BRING ON THE RECOVERY BITCH and part of me is like a 13 year old on pro-ana tumblr telling me I don’t need help and this is just “my lifestyle” or whatever.

My weight is pretty low (BMI &gt;!15.5!&lt;) but I eat a pretty decent amount in ED terms (&gt;!about 1400 a day!&lt;) so I don’t really know what to expect the doctor to say. Will he diagnose me and make me eat 3 huge meals and 3 huge snacks a day right off the bat?? I’m so scared to gain weight but I also kinda don’t want to lose more, do I even have an eating disorder?

"Work trauma and going back to work - panic and ptsd I am having trouble getting through interview processes to go back into normal FT work. The interviews themselves trigger trauma and also cause panic and flashbacks about multiple places.

"PTSD and mild delusions on Vyvanse Hi everyone. 

For starters, I do not have any psychotic disorders (although I have had depression and adhd since I was very young, and was diagnosed with ptsd at 14 but didn’t take the diagnosis seriously until this past summer),  but my therapist has said it seems my brain concocts scenarios or conversations when something doesn’t make sense to me in my interpersonal relationships as a coping mechanism for ptsd. Vyvanse seemed to intensify this problem for me. 

I’m on Wellbutrin and cymbalta. Switched from vyvanse back to adderall and I haven’t had any issues related to delusions since then. 

Does anyone else with diagnosed PTSD experience delusions that are very difficult to distinguish from reality (more so like false memories) when under prolonged periods of intense stress in general, or while on Vyvanse specifically?

"Questioning my PTSD Since I got out of the military, I finally started seeing a psychiatrist and going to counseling. What I perceived to be REALLY bad anxiety was actually diagnosed as PTSD. 

I almost feel ashamed of it because it isn’t combat related, I was never shot or anything like that. I had never dealt with the death of a friend or family member... no one, until I joint the Army. I was stationed up in Alaska, I had a friend kill himself in April, another friend died in a training accident (truck rolled over and killed him), and have also been to countless funerals and memorials. My life wasn’t necessarily in danger but I’ve gone through some really shorty things. I went through the nightmares, survivors guilt.. intrusive thoughts, i self medicated with Alcohol for a solid 2 years (now two years sober), but I still find myself questioning it. 

I’ve been doing better since starting therapy and getting the right medicine, yet I still can’t shake the feeling of being alone in this and feeling ashamed of the fact that it wasn’t caused by the war.

**Warriors' Roundtable**: ""After an intense combat deployment in 2008, veterans of 2/7 were featured in 2015 in a series of articles in the *New York Times* and an article in the *Psychiatric Times*. This publicity dubbed 2/7 as “The Forgotten Battalion.” Many of these Marines and Sailors desire to be remembered for the mission they accomplished and the honor of serving their country and their Corps. They reject the moniker, “The Forgotten Battalion”, which inadvertently feeds into a narrative in society that paints veterans as broken. The majority of 2/7 veterans have continued to live their lives, finding ways to thrive and continuing to write their personal narrative. As you listen, enter into these stories and conversations, discussing healthy coping skills and providing tangible examples of hope. ""

"Hypervigilance and aggressivity It's almost a year since I had to quit my meds. Since then, I've been to hell again and again, but also made a lot of progress in therapy. My health seems to be better than ever now, but one thing persists:

I always get episodes of hypervigilance and extreme aggressiveness. I'm always looking for a threat, thinking ""If this guy looks funny at me I'm gonna rip his face off "". Of course I don't want to hurt anyone and have never done so in my adult life. 
I call this my ""fight mode"". 

I  have the suspicion that quitting my meds messed with my hormone levels or something. That I put on a significant amount of muscle mass while simultaneously losing fat, which shouldn't really be possible at my training level points in that direction. Are maybe my testosterone levels too high? Or is that really just in my mind? 

These hypervigilant states are extremely exhausting.  I usually let this excessive energy out through training, often to the point where I accept injury as a side effect.

"Looking for perspective: Long Term relationship with my SO who abuses alcohol Ok so, long story short, I’ve been with my bf (26m) for 10 yrs now, I’m 26f. I don’t know how to best describe his challenges with alcohol but basically he can stop after one drink but he struggles with cravings and is not fun for me to be around when he gets wasted. 

Tbh I’m nervous posting this even but I would love some perspective and objective support.

The bad:
He has been going through cycles throughout our time together, each time getting better and better, but still it’s VERY hard for me as I think his past episodes have really effected me. Currently looking for a therapist for myself to process through these times. When he is “blacked out” He has cut himself (more of a release of energy, not suicidal), talks in circles, gets argumentative, emotional abuse, punched furniture on 3 occasions, and attempted suicide once (3 yrs ago). Resistant to the idea of AA and I don’t want to push him because I want him to get help for his own reasons, not mine. 

The good:
No physical abuse. We are able to speak openly about how I feel after episodes, he recognizes that he is creating an issue for me and us. Is stuck between feeling really bad, working on it, and managing himself. He explained never wanting to attempt suicide again, apologized to me for it. Just a very sweet, caring, and honest guy. I can tell he is really sorry and is trying his best. He acknowledges and supports that I don’t enable him and supports me in getting help for what we’ve been through (he knows it’s because of him). 

Where I’m at now:
He mentioned a ring recently and basically is giving clear hints of engagement that may occur in an upcoming trip. I was definitely ready for this and very happy as he hadn’t had an episode in a longg time, months. However, 3/4 weeks ago he had a pretty bad one and it made me feel horrible. Before this I felt so happy and was starting to feel 100% that I would be happy with him for the rest of my life. But since this episode, I’m just worried about the fact of this cycle that I will have to keep living with him and what that will look like if I want to have a family and be happy. I’ve talked to him about this concern specifically, and he agrees that he doesn’t want that either and that it will keep getting better but he can’t give me a solid answer on if episodes like this one wont happen again, and I get it. It’s just really hard. It would be easier if he was a horrible person so I could leave him. 

I honestly cannot think about what I would say if he dropped down on one knee and asked the question. I want to say “yes” but I’m also afraid. Has anyone else experienced this?

"This is a pretty dumb thing that ruined my day but... I am so lonely. I have not spoken to anyone but my boyfriend in a month or so. I have PTSD from childhood abuse and abuse from my ex. I am genuinely so terrified of people and have recently been medicated to get my agoraphobia under control.

I was in school for my dream course. I have had a lot of health issues and was hospitalized 3 times in 2 months. I had a field trip and it took all of me to go because I was so terrified of people and convinced all they will do is hurt you -- and had fainted from high blood pressure a few days prior. 

While there I told someone I thought was my friend to stay safe because she mentioned a guy's name who had raped my friend a year ago. She contacted him and he blew up my boyfriend's phone (not even mine) threatening to jump me and ruin my life, and that my boyfriend needed to be a man and shut me up. When I tried to speak to her about it she shoved me and screamed at me. I blacked out. Threw up. Fainted. Teacher had to get me back to the school nurse and my school counselor. I fainted in front of them. I could not see. I kept blacking out. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life. When the school finally allowed me to leave the officer at the school said I needed to get a restraining order for my own safety.

My boyfriend took me to get one, while I was still light-headed and sick, and they refused me because ""He had not done anything to me yet.""

I pulled out of school because I am just so scared and sick. I have not spoken to anyone but my boyfriend in a month. In my class group chat we were invited to a party for Halloween and my boyfriend told me that it would be a great way to test getting back around people. I tried to be positive and actually got pretty excited.

Earlier today I realised that a kind of funny/absurd/nasty delusion that I have, is that people poisin my drinks but even worse, that people might do nasty stuff to my tooth brush that I am unaware of, like... you know, putting it in places it shouldn’t be and even though it makes me laugh, it’s also disgusting and stressful not to be able to lock my door while at the ward.

Anyway, I just wanted to write this so you guys didn’t get too confused about why this profile suddenly posts on here.

"StimSensory: UK stim toy store run by an autistic person. [StimSensory Ltd](https://www.stimsensory.co.uk/) is an online store that sells stim toys for neurodiverse adults at affordable prices. 

The company was started by myself, an autistic young adult, after I got frustrated by the lack of affordable stim toys available in the UK. Most stim toys were aimed at children, were very expensive, and/or were intended for sensory rooms rather than stimming on the go. Many companies were also only focused upon one method of stimming, rather than catering for every sense.

I set up StimSensory so that people could access stim toys for every sense, at affordable prices. If you’d like to read more, you can read about the company [here.](https://www.stimsensory.co.uk/about-us)

Whilst the business is still new and small, I hope to increase our stim toy options to offer stim toys for everyone who stims, such as those with ADHD or trichotillomania. 

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to comment.

Thanks for reading! :)",autism,autism
"Friends doubt your diagnosis process? I have one last remaining real friend. I love her to death but I have never been my *true* self around her.  I also finally had my assessment today and told her about it, and I get the feeling she thinks I’m being dumb or overly dramatic about the whole thing.  She doesn’t know half of what’s going on in my head or everyday life at home.  She said I’m a “really fun person to be around but in a group I shut down and I need to just get out of my own way”, like it’s that fking easy to suddenly just be a social butterfly and loved by all people.  That kinda hurt. I guess I’m not “autistic enough”?  I don’t know why you would say that. “Just get out of your own way.”  Like I’m doing it on purpose.  Like alllll these years I’ve been lonely and lacking friends by choice. Such a simple solution.  

Did anybody else deal with friends doubting you while you were going through the assessment/diagnosis process?  Or act like it was just all in your head?

"Quick survey: who here has struggled with OCD-type symptoms? Seems contradictory, doesn't it? That you can have ""attention deficit disorder"", and yet be obsessed with details.

Except... in my mind it's not contradictory at all. That would be like saying, ""*how is it that can you have a small penis yet own a flash car with a massive engine?*""—well, it's OBVIOUS!

Nothing about ADHD prohibits obsessive behaviour. Quite the contrary: if you struggle to find connection with things going on around you, *of course* you're going to compensate by reflecting all of your energy inwards!

...I'm anticipating the greatest response to this question from ADHD-PI people. Curious about how others might relate.

"I feel alone  

I'm 16, 17 in December.

and I have PTSD

I was diagnosed last year, and honest to god, I didn't process any of it. A few months earlier than my PTSD diagnosis, I was diagnosed with GAD, and the two seem a world apart.

I just need to get this off my chest.

As the second anniversary of the goddamn event that screwed my brain over approaches quickly, I've been falling into trap after trap with my PTSD. My triggers are the smallest, dumbest, most random ass things that no one would think are triggers. The most inconspicuous things just sets me straight into a panic attack. I try and smile through them but I'm struggling. I hate that these are my triggers. I don't dislike any of them, I want to normalize them, but I can't do that when I feel like I'm going to pass out every time I encounter them.

I recently experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. And I didn't see some ungodly demon standing in the corner of my room or an old hag sitting on me, quite frankly I'd rather see them. I couldn't open my eyes, I was just paralysed, every inch of my body felt like lead, and all I felt was the sensations of the event and the sheer horror that ran through me as I refused to even attempt to open my eyes in fear that I'd come face to face with it.

I'm losing sleep. I see movement out of the corner of my eyes and dark shadows in places where no one else sees them. I can't focus, my anxiety is wearing me down and my brain just slowly works its way back to what happened every time I try to shove it to the farthest reaches of my subconscious.

Its frustrating that I can't find stories or accounts of others around my age experiencing the same things. Teenage PTSD is so stigmatized its actually dangerous. Apart from the occasional 'coming out of foster care' story, I don't find things I can relate to. I guess it makes sense. Teenaged girls don't have PTSD, it just doesn't happen, but I'm living proof that it does, and it feels to me like I'm alone in that. I haven't been in foster care or an orphanage, I haven't been in a war, my event seems inconsequential in the face of all that. I feel alone. I can't find others like me. Its wearing me down, and I'm afraid. I'm afraid I'll have to live my life knowing that.",ptsd,ptsd
"Any advice on revisiting my trauma from 5 years ago to grief properly? About 5 years ago when I was 16 my grandpa committed suicide and a few weeks later my dad passed away. At this time I was so low I was unable to show my face at school because the first day I went back all eyes were on me and the abnormal attention was too much, along with many other things I’d rather not discuss. Kids are mean. At this time we decided home bound was the option for me. In order to be home bound because of “mental illness,” it was required to be seen by psychologist and psychiatrist consistently on a weekly basis. That’s where I was prescribed all of the different anxiety/depression medications you can think of. I feel as though this time period of my brain constantly being fogged by medication stripped me of my ability to properly grieve. Fast forward to now and I feel as though I have a strong unbalance within me. There’s no doubt in my mind that I need to revisit this time in my life and grief properly for the sake of my sanity. Does anyone have advice on how I should begin to reface the part of my life that gives me suffering and sorrow every day? For some reason I feel like maybe going somewhere beautiful to write my feelings down could be helpful. Therapy isn’t an option for me anymore. While I support it and have seen it work wonders for my loved ones, my experience of therapy hasn’t been helpful for me. I’m an introverted soul that feels like this is something I need to face on my own. Was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience on revisiting grief that could give me words of advice or encouragement?

Long story short: years of medication during my traumatic experience has inhibited my ability to grieve properly. What to do now? I would like to revisit this time of my life to work through my issues. How do I do that? Write? ",ptsd,ptsd

"I think I've been subconsciously masking my whole life, but I think it might be making me a better person? I've for a long time known that I tend to do things because I should do them, rather than because I want to. When it comes to brushing my teeth or doing chores, this is a good thing!

But I also do this socially, and I'm not sure if it's a good thing there. However, who I am ""unmasked"" is one, so unfamiliar to me that I don't know if it's really possible, because I've lived my entire life based on how I should be acting. 

And if I didn't do that, I think I would be a bad person? 

Like, I help strangers in public because I know thats the right thing to do, not because I necessarily want to. 

But I also have been dating my girlfriend for almost a year, and this whole time I've been acting like I think a good partner should act. But. does that mean that without masking, I would be a bad partner? It certainly seems that way. 

Without acting how I ""should"" act I would be more selfish, more lazy, less kind, all around probably a worse person.

How do I balance being more genuine while also not using it as an excuse for bad habits?

I'm specifically worried about what this means for my relationship. As an example, I do like spending time with her, just not as frequently as she does. I would be happy only seeing her once every couple of days, but she wants to spend more time together than that. 

I love her a lot! And I felt that, since I do love her I should want to spend more time with her than that, so I do. Also because if I don't she'll feel neglected and I don't want that. But now, spending time with her or doing other things to meet her expectations can feel like a chore.

I'm worried that I'm secretly just selfish and lazy, and trying to avoid that by claiming autism as an excuse. 

I'm also worried that our relationship is doomed because I can't do what she wants/needs without being unhappy myself.",autism,autism

"Triggered at a doctor’s office Has anyone else ever experienced this?

I had been going to physical therapy for back pain for months when one of the exercises triggered the worst episode / panic attack I’ve ever had.  The exercise involved being face down and not being able to see what was happening, and that day, I couldn’t do it.  During the attack, I tried desperately to explain how the pain won’t stop so I just need to make friends with it, and saying that I was supposed to be done by now.  It probably looked like I lost my natural mind, and to be fair, I did.  I was scared and wanted to run and hide.

Earlier that same day, we had a tragedy at work that I had to handle.  Additionally, I hadn’t been able to sleep for more than three hours at a time for over a month, so I was running on fumes and should have called out.

The doctors’ response was to get frustrated and discharge me.  Not that I necessarily blame them, but they were writing up a report on me and said - in front of me, very frustrated - “We need a box on this that says, ‘Frame of mind’.”  They know about the PTSD.  

It was humiliating.  I have one more session with them, and I’m dreading it.  

Whenever my back is worked on, I can’t help being jumpy.  During a session recently, one of the doctors asked, “Did I scare you?”  I said, “Yeah, a little.”  The doctor responded, “Well how do you think I feel?  I’m like, ‘What did I do?’”

"diagnosed ADD at 28. I have a history of emotional abuse from childhood and one long term toxic/abusive relationship. How much of an influence did ADD have on this and how to I learn to deal with it? I'm 28 and was diagnosed around 2 months ago. I'm currently on 36mg concerta and have a prescription for 1mg Lorazepam for anxiety and 10mg ritalin as supplemental treatment (previously on 30mg vyvanse that wasn't getting me through my work day without crashing).

My history of emotional/verbal abuse was from my Dad, started at a young age. I was always a sensitive but argumentative child and had a lot of demanding needs (according to my mum). When I was loving I was very loving but had a temper that could be set off by minute things.

My Dad was not a mentally stable man himself and set his sights on me early on. We didn't see eye to eye a lot and he said/did some awful things to me and then to my brother and sister as my parents went through divorce and he seemingly completely lost his mind. 
I cut him out of my life at 16.

I had a relationship not long after that that was quite toxic. My ability to communicate is poor and like i said, I had a terrible temper. I also hated myself because I had taken on board a lot of the awful things my dad said to me. I know my bf at the time cared about me a lot but I had the relationship very difficult to navigate and eventually he gave up.

This pattern has repeated in my life multiple times, the worst was my longest relationship. He was also diagnosed ADHD at a young age (at this point my diagnosis was non-existent). We had a very toxic relationship, lots of fights, manipulation, demanding and at times downright unloving. I was very forgiving because I felt responsible, for him but also a lot of guilt for my own part in it. I sought professional help for my issues, however he refused to take responsibility and do the same. This went on for four years in a pattern of the relationship being good and fun and loving to awful and yelling fights. Ultimately I walked away.

I've just done the whole cycle again but with a really close friend who I fell in love with. I let me anxiety get in the way and found it difficult to not let it infect the relationship. I have my temper/anger issues under control for the most part but the anxiety is still there and I have trouble communicating when the stakes are high (or percieved high). I make up stories and ideas of how he feels about me in my head and allow them to become a reality. I get very confused when we have conversations and he says things that are completely opposite to what I expected.

Does anyone have similar experience or have professional knowledge to help me see this clearly?

Is this the ADD, the childhood trauma (inability to communicate - freeze response-), the anxiety or a really awful combination.

How to i get through this and become someone who can be a loving, communicative considerate partner?

I don't want to be in any more toxic relationships where I hurt someone with my inability to see whats real and whats imagined.",adhd,adhd

"Blackouts and resisting the inclination Hello, umm.

This is the first time I am actually trying to talk about this openly (even if it's on an anonymous forum) and not just having a monologue in my head. So that's a step forward right? This is kind of a venting post, but I also want to maybe ask for an advice, idk. It might be too long to read, sorry about that. 

Three years ago after I finished 'high school', I moved out from my parents' house to live on my own in a different city to study in university. Shortly before I passed my leaving exam, I went through the roughest period in my life (abusive relationship, depression, anxiety, insomnia which led into hospitalization in mental health clinic). Anyway, I was 'free' of my problems (not really but maybe you know what I mean? I felt better and hoped it would be okay forever) when I moved there and was out to live my best life.

It turned into excessive drinking ride instead. It started innocent, it was fun and I mean, everyone had a night when they went a little too far with the alcohol. But it got worse over the time. Everyone in my surroundings was also drinking and partying a lot (with the difference they also knew when to stop, most of the time). At one point, I was falling asleep very drunk at least 5 nights a week. I didn't have blackouts at first, nor did I behave 'weird' when drunk but that was about to change.

I never knew when to stop drinking even before it became a problem. I always drank until I couldn't take any more or the party ended (which was mostly happening in the early years before I moved). 

First thing that started happening was me getting suddenly very anxious and saying some depressing stuff when I was drunk (suicidial thoughts rants) even though I wasn't thinking about that when I was sober. But at least I remembered it even though I couldn't control it.

The next thing that started happening was blackouts. Memory loss. Which happens to people all the time. The trouble is that usually, when I have a blackout, I do something incredibly stupid. The first time the blackout happened to me was when I was at a party. I drank a LOT and the last thing I remember before it gets blank is taking like a tenth shot of herb liquor. The next thing is me waking up from a drunken sleep/passing out, idk. There's a guy on top of me, having sex with me. I don't know how that happened (maybe I initiated it and then passed out or he saw his chance and he took it). I didn't know where I picked him up at all or who he was. I never had this issue before. This experience didn't stop me from drinking more and it became more usual. It escalated to the point where I was just doing really stupid shit for which there is no apology even though I don't remember it or have it very hazy. I'm talking mild drug usage, being very rude and other things I'd rather not mention here because I am just so ashamed. 

I usually vomited all over the place. Because my tolerance increased, I could drink a lot and be aware of my surroundings until I wasn't.

The blackouts started to happen more often until it started happening every time I drank (because it never stayed at one beer or one shot).

Each time I did something embarrasing I told myself I'm done with alcohol. But each time (so far) I did it again. And the blackout and stupid behavior happened again. And I told myself I won't repeat doing that but I ended up in the same position some time later anyway. Endless circle.

I don't think I'm physically addicted to alcohol. I never suffered withdrawal symptomps even after going weeks without a drink (after the blackouts and shameful situations started to happen more than often and I tried to quit I went even weeks without alcohol but...). But I have some mental issue with it. I don't believe I can have fun without it (because honestly I don't, when I go to a party and don't drink, I don't have a fun and struggle with communication). I also have a hard time saying no and my friends and acquitances keep pressuring me and shaming me when I decline a drink and I am not good at saying no.

Oh, what now. How do I get rid of the shame I feel? I am scared I'll drink again because I miss it and I'll screw up again and maybe worse than before. I don't even know if I have a problem. I just feel lost... Do you think I have a problem or am I exagerratjng? What should I do now? 

PS1: I am at 15 day without alcohol now. I miss it but I don't physically need it. Ever since then my tobacco usage increased by 50%. I am a petite woman, 22, from a country where drinking is a social norm and at my worst, I could do about 15! shots of hard liquor (vodka, whiskey) without puking. It's terrible. 

PS2: This post was triggered by me seeing a young woman in the pub today who got very drunk, passed out on the table, then fell down from the chair, peed herself and people were taking shots of her to share online. Poor thing. I don't want to end up like her but I worry it will happen if I won't stop.

"(Strange title) Ear Plugs Has anyone had any experience with ear plugs to cope with sensory issues?

I bought some Quieton Earplugs, they were around £160 so pretty expensive for earplugs! Someone had recommended them so thought I’d give them a try.

They are actually pretty amazing. They allow you to hear sounds like voices and alarms, but block out background noises that can become unbearable for some of us!

Unfortunately they quieten voices too much to wear them at work, but for general day to day activities they make such a difference. I really wish I could use them all day every day, because the moment of peace when I put them on is so refreshing, but they do just block out a bit too much to be able to.

I’m sure there are way cheaper that may do the same thing, but these have worked really well for me.

Does anyone know of anything like this that could be used and still be able to hear people properly?",adhd,adhd

"I have become significantly more easily affected by alcohol compared to a few years ago I am 30 years old (might or might not be relevant). Something that has happened to me during the past year or so is that I seem much less tolerant of alcohol compared to previously. For example, it used to be that drinking 5 beers during an evening would be a good evening. Nowadays, if I drink 5 beers in an evening, I will get a pretty bad hangover the following day. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also seems to me that my memory function is more affected by alcohol compared to a few years ago. Not that I get blackouts (it has happened of course, but not on a regular basis), but more like that memories of some episodes are more patchy.

"24 year old need help Hi Everyone,

I am 24 year old. 

Would you guys consider my situation alcoholism?;

I can go for weeks without a drink, but once I have 1 drink, I will literally not stop until I run out of money, everywhere is closed, I black out or get punched in the face. The stuff literally lights my brain up like a Christmas tree after only a couple of drinks and I could no longer give a shit about anything. I become absolutely fucking insane after 6-7 drinks to the point that I have zero control over what I am doing (e.g. at the weekend, I nearly got arrested for throwing glasses off the wall of a nightclub). I always tell myself that this is the last time, but in a couple of weeks time, I find myself in the same situation again. Some very dangerous situations at times. 

I know that I have a serious problem with alcohol, but I just can't seem to stop this binge drink spiral. All of my friends drink (most of them more than me), but they don't seem to go on like such an idiot as I do. The culture in the country I live in (UK) is heavily focused on drinking and everyone does it. I struggle to stop for these reasons. I think that I am becoming a joke and my life feels like it is on a spiral. I have completely lost all self respect and I don't know what to try next.

I realized that one of my biggest weaknesses as an ADHDer is that I tend to ramble a lot whether it be in how I write with those block paragraphs or even at job interviews.

1. I am worried I might forget things later on if I don't say them immediately. 
2. I have this fear that I might seem incompetent if I am not specific enough.

"Do I have schizophrenia? Hi... 

I'm passing throught some struggle and I'm in doubt if it could be schizophrenic symptoms. My sister has it, so it makes me think that too...

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I quited a relationship in january, on the first week (actually he broke up with me) but it took me 3 months to accept it was over, but I don't feel like this was out of normal... But the thing is that I kept seeing him, even after the breakup, and it was harming me because I wanted to get back feeling all I used to feel for him and I couldn't. So I decided I would really finish this but I kept procrastinating. On the weekend before the last one, we saw each other and when I got home I said to myself that I had to end it. But I read a lot of Deleuze and Guatarri and some weeks before, I started chatting with a woman on a facebook group, and when I told my situation to her she said it was possible to recover the feelings I had. But I really felt like it wasn't possible, but what I had with this boyfriend was something really strong, so I decided to do a post on this same group asking about this possibility, of recovering desire when there ain't anymore. A psychologist texted me saying that it was possible and I think I took a really dumb attitude. My mind was telling me to move on, and text my ex that we should stop seeing each other. But instead, how all of me didn't want this (to go on this psychologist - I know it sounds weird because I'm saying that I text him because I wanted to) - I decided to force me to go to the mental state I was after the breakup. Like getting back a phase. Cause I knew that reasonable as I was, nothing that guy tells me would help me at all to get back feeling as I felt for my ex because it was over. But well, now I'm feeling that it could be possible, and I could get back feeling those things... But it doesn't make any sense at all. And also I feel three other things: that I'm relativizating the reality, that it doesn't matter (like I lost the consequences sense) and that I kind of lost a little of all of my senses... (It feels like my memory of some things on the relationship is not working, it feels like all the things I learned with it has gone and it feels like I totally don't know what I actually want)

Not our first time to this show but, a few weeks ago I talked to my husband about his drinking which was getting out of hand. He claims it was just the one time (I know, I know, it wasn’t one time) but agreed to get help and said he’d stop drinking again. But he won’t tell any one else about this. For instance, he told his brother he wasn’t drinking because he’s on a diet with me. 

Yesterday he had his first appointment with a therapist, and told me he felt really good about his sobriety. Tonight he got sauced. After some incoherent chatter and adamant insistence that he hadn’t drank a thing, he passed out and I went hunting for evidence that I wasn’t crazy . Ive found several garbage bags full of empties. I realize it’s worse than I thought. 

Is it ok for me to tell his family? I have a 10 month old baby and I can’t take care of her and him all by myself. I know he’ll be furious and I can accept that but I don’t want to undermine his recovery and therapy. Is it only his story to tell?

"Has homelessness created sleep anxiety/insomnia for anyone else? When I was 13, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was too weak to keep up with the bills, and by the time she told me about her tumor, we had a week to move out. 

After that, we lived in and out of motels, in friend's guest rooms, and sometimes a hotel. During that time, I began to be fiercely afraid of sleeping and dreaming. I was afraid to let my guard down. If I went to sleep, I was afraid that I would be attacked or my mother would die in the middle of the night.

I also live in Albuquerque, so living in a motel here is NOT fun.

It's been 6 years and I am still not completely recovered. I sleep much, much easier, but there are some nights where I will close my eyes, drift off slightly, and be slapped with a hyperventilating panic attack. I will stay up until dawn and begin to cry hysterically, afraid that I will be awake for too long and have horrible hallucinations. I have NEVER had any sleep induced hallucinations, however.

Nothing has made me feel more alone than this sleep anxiety. My mother is a hibernating grizzly bear, so she never understood the fear. Everyone just told me to ""meditate"". I was 13. I didn't even understand my body yet. I know they were trying to help, and I'm thankful.

Medical marijuana has DRASTICALLY improved my sleep. It's not perfect yet, but I'm never going to quit trying. Yes, I am also in therapy.",ptsd,ptsd

"Diagnosed with schizophrenia but think I have health anxiety? I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier this year while hospitalized.

I didn't develop a good relationship with the doctors that diagnosed me and stopped taking the Haloperidol they gave me.

I believe I have health anxiety and my current psychiatrist kind of sort of agrees with me. This second relationship is also very poor. I'm uncomfortable with it and wish I could see someone else but the trauma of all these awful past experiences makes it hard to motivate myself to make the change.

**I believe I have suffered from health anxiety since I was at least 19. That year I thought I had skin cancer (I'm olive to brown skinned and no one in my family has ever had this type of cancer). I wasn't able to sleep for days thinking about it and even feel like I experienced mild hallucinations, that I got bigger, inflated like a balloon in the middle of a sleepless night. I think I even was experiencing panic attacks then, but it's been hard to get a doctor to help me figure out if I did or didn't. Like I said I don't feel listened to in my relationship with my psychiatrist.**

**A funny thing that happens to me when my anxiety gets really bad is that I switch from one disease to another within days or hours and don't realize how unreasonable I'm being. I'll worry I have skin cancer one day, the next it's Lyme disease, the next leukemia. Or sometimes the degree of severity changes, one day I'll forecast one round of chemotherapy (don't know how any of this actually works), the next I'm convinced that it's terminal. Does anyone here experience the same?**

**I usually read tons of info on it online, see a doctor once because I live in a rural area (if I didn't I might have fallen into the habit of multiple visits with different doctors), find and stalk real people who have the disease online, join groups about it, read books, sometimes even prescribe myself ""fixes"", like juicing or dieting, exercise, etc.**

**Another really important aspect is that I seem to develop a lot of rituals or** [compulsions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3LaY8pjD4E) **that help me calm down. Excercise, eating habits, cleanliness related. The more I do them and time passes, because they calm me down, I start to think it's the ""illness"" that's getting better.**

**Since that year I was 19, it really hasn't gone away, it just morphs into a preoccupation with a different illness.** 

By the way everything bolded, which I think is extremely relevant, is stuff I didn't get to tell the unethical megalomaniacs that diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I mentioned the word hypochondria once and was kicked out of the room. Subsequently, I only talked to them about the weather and the food there. They cited they were still able to give me a serious diagnosis taking into account their ""observations"" of me, as if nothing I said mattered and I don't have the ability to have insight into myself and help them, cooperate to find my real diagnosis. I feel as if I was treated like an animal and think their diagnosis is complete trash.",schizophrenia,schizophrenia

"So confusing! I feel like my Brain has his own personality. He talks to me or to himself, and the things he says are stupid and random ( eg: ""meow, I am a cucumber!""), he sometimes talks about dying (eg:  ""let's DIIIIE!"", ""I am dying"", etc - i am not suicidal, and what he says doesn't affect me.), sometimes he is very mean towards the people I am talking to (he once was telling me how my brother's girlfriend is very stupid or how he is surprised that a friend of mine still has two neurons which work), etc.

Once I was tasting a soup, but it was too hot and my tongue got burnt. Brain started screaming about how my grandma, who made the soup, was trying to kill us. 

Sometimes he says just a few things and then calms down, but there are also moments when he won't stop talking. Sometimes I even tell him to shut up and replies to me with indifference. I feel like he really is a person who is always by my side. Once, i had to attend an event all by myself, but I didn't feel alone, because he was present. It made me feel strange, but also safe.

The problem is that I don't understand which thoughts are mine amd which are his.

"Mentioning Previous Medication Use to Psychologist? Hi, I'm in the middle of being assessed for ADHD and I'm kind of nervous because I worry what will happen to me academically if I'm not able to be diagnosed. I'm in university right now and while I've always had trouble focusing/organizing workspaces/keeping thoughts linear it's become harder and harder to perform in school.


To get to the point of my post, what finally prompted me to seek out a diagnosis was when a friend gave me one of their Ritalin. It was wild, the world seemed to ""slow down"" (not literally, but my thoughts became more settled and linear and I didn't have the urge to do stuff like get up and pace or constantly stop doing work to mess with something, etc.). I told her about that and she said that's what it's like for her too, so this is what finally sort of mentally confirmed it to myself that I have ADHD.


Now that I'm seeing a psychologist and am being assessed I'm wondering if I should mention that to her, obviously I think that would be a clue that there is a problem but I'm worried that if I say that I'll be viewed as a liar who's now just trying to get a prescription to abuse it or something. It doesn't help that my mother has kind of been pushing that I don't have it (since I rely on her to give an account of my childhood symptoms) because she's afraid of me taking ADHD meds.


TL;DR Should I tell psychologist I've used Ritalin once before and it made me feel ""normal""",adhd,adhd

My concern is the adults some will ask her questions like favorite color or food etc (I am always present of course) she may start to answer one or two questions but as the conversation goes on everything the answer is yes.

Q: what's your favorite animal?
A: yes

Q: how old are you
A: yes

The adult looks at me confused to where I explain she has autism with speech delays. I'm at the point where do I keep explaining to people her diagnosis or should I just leave it alone? I dont want to be one of those parents who embarrass her by telling everyone about her diagnosis at the same time I feel the need to protect her as she doesnt always talk. Lately even at home we are having a hard time hearing her because she talks so low sometimes (almost a whisper)

"Worried I've slipped without noticing I've had issues with alcohol since a teenager however I felt until recently that I had it all under control. A few drinks on a social occasion and that was it.

Yesterday I ended up drinking from mid day despite the fact I decided not to and despite the fact I was at work. I know I am not waking up and having a drink and honestly at home I don't either but it's like if I have one I can't stop.

"Medication vs Therapy? I've had ADHD since I was a little kid. I never went to see a psychiatrist because my parents were weird and didn't want a 4th grader to take medication. So instead they took me to get [Nurofeedback therapy](https://www.drakeinstitute.com/non-drug-adhd-treatment) at Drake Institute, who basically claim that by mapping your brain using qEEG, they can focus on certain areas and eliminate ADHD symptoms without drugs. Now that I'm in college I kinda want to start taking medication. Reading this sub's posts about medication make it seem like it solves a lot of the small problems I deal with, but IDK how I feel taking a mind altering substance everyday for the rest of my life.

Do the medications for ADHD make you into a different person? I like who I am, I have made myself into the person I want to be and I always want to be in control of myself. Is medication something I should pursue if I've already gone through treatment?  

**TLDR; I went to ""therapy"" for when I was a kid Now I'm in college and I want to get on medication but unsure due to side effects and previous treatment.**

Edit: Just to clarify, I don't know if the Drake Institute ""worked"" for me or not. I still feel a lot of the typical symptoms of ADHD, just not as intensely as I did when I was a kid. ",adhd,adhd
"Alcohol is my crutch for confrontation I've never learned to argue properly or stand up for myself. My older sibling was a bully, so I quickly learned to avoid disagreements and hide from confrontation. My parents divorced  early. I never saw them argue. Furthermore, my mom is a doormat and I've only witnessed her lose an argument to said older sibling. As a young adult I was in an abusive relationship, and I learned that confrontation can be physically dangerous. 

Fast-forward 20 years, and no surprize, I've developed an alcohol problem and an avoidance problem. When I've had any problems at work, I ghost that job. I don't even pick up my last paycheck, or show up to the last few scheduled shifts. I've left friends and cities behind. Left classes without properly dropping the class and getting fails on my college record.

I got sent home from work yesterday for acting funny. I told the supervisor I skipped my mental medication and blurted out that I have PTSD. I do have PTSD and I've been out of 1 medication for about 6 weeks. But truthfully, I was drinking on the job. I could possibly salvage my job with lies. I just don't have the courage to have a sober conversation. I've tried it a couple times in the last 10 years. I just start shaking and crying uncontrollably. I mean I become a blubbering mess. 

Last night I tried a couple of times to call my boss. Sitting there staring at my phone, thinking what I could possibly say. Instead I induced a panic attack. So I start doing shots right away to calm myself down. Alcohol alleviates boredom and loneliness, yes, but for me, I need it the most for uncomfortable conversations. How do I get past that part?

I really don’t know what to do, I’m not sure if I’m being overreactive and using this as an excuse for just being socially awkward, or that I just don’t have adhd and this could be a possible explanation for all my abnormalities.

Recently I have found the Want to quit but it is so hard  Because even now that I live away from my dad and he is not my responsibility anymore, I can't  Stop, I find other excuses to drink.

I plan my day so that I can drink, If something goes wrong to where I can't I will lie or cancel plans to make sure I can stay home get drunk and play my games.

 I'm not sure what I hoped for in writing this post but I just need help and I could use all the advice you guys have to offer. I want to be healthy, I want to quit drinking so that when I do have kids with my wife that I am marrying week from today but I will be there for all the important moments.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Hello r/autism. I need some help... I am a 20 year old male finishing my first semester in university. I’ve been living with ADHD since I was very young, but I feel like I might fall into the spectrum with some of the other symptoms I have. Most of which make social interactions so much of a challenge to the point of avoiding any social interaction at all. 

It might be helpful for me to talk to a parent of a son with mild autism or someone close to my age with mild autism. I feel it would be very beneficial for me to have somebody to talk to about my symptoms and to guide me forward.

"Crowd Sourcing Ideas for Fictional Book Hi everyone! I'm an author, and I'm writing a fictional book about a girl who develops PTSD after a sexual assault. I have PTSD myself, so I have my own experiences to draw on, but I'd love to here from you to inspire some of the conversations and themes in the book. Which is why I'm asking you a few questions: What is the best thing a therapist (or anyone, really) has told you that has helped you cope or better understand your PTSD and its symptoms? What would you want to tell people who don't have PTSD/what would you want people without PTSD to know? What advice would you give to other survivors?

"Life getting better Hi, first time poster here. I'm from Chile (sorry for the awful english) and sober for three weeks now.

I started drinking when I was 14 (21 now), from the start i loved drinking, it killed all my introvert aspects and made   
me loosen up. Met most of my life friends while drunk and drinking became a rule when going out. I was always the drunkest in all parties and it pretty much became my personality. Drinking became my reason to get  through  the week and I got drunk every friday and saturday for 6-7 years. 

Every now and then I treated people like shit, made a lot of mistakes, lost a lot of friends, and this year alcohol mixed with depression made me drop out of university. After two months of lying after dropping out I decided to get some help. I'm going to a therapist and taking medication, starting working out, ended relationships that were harming me and kept the ones that support my mental health. 

I now feel soo much better mentally and physically, sun's brighter, hangovers are gone, and the guilt is slowly fading. Still miss drinking tho, the parties and the lack of social anxiety, but I don't think i'm going back to that any time soon. Reading some posts has helped me a lot this past three weeks and I would love to help you guys back.

Thanks for reading.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"[F, 22] Delayed onset PTSD due to possible past sexual assault experiences. I'm confused. Please help. These are my past experiences which I think is and is close to sexual assault:

● I was in my teens (high school) when this happened. I was in the living room with my mom, dad, and sister. We were hanging out when suddenly my dad decided he wanted to touch my genital. I moved away because I felt uncomfortable, but he kept on reaching for it and he was eventually able to touch it. I felt violated, but they were laughing, including my mom so I dismissed the feeling. Please, don't misunderstand. My father is a bit emotionally and mentally abusive, but he never tried to abuse me sexually except for instances like I mentioned.

● This happened when I was in college. It was late and there were no seats left, so I had no choice but to stand up in the bus so I could go home. I felt something hard on my rear, which I didn't quite pay attention to due to the bus being so crowded. I thought it was a belt or a bag, but then my friend (who was standing as well) suddenly pulled me closer to her and told me the guy behind me was rubbing his crotch on my back. The shocking thing is I laughed because I thought it was funny. When I arrived home, that's when I realized that what happened wasn't normal. I suddenly felt cold and mad at myself for reacting that way.

● I was still in college and these happened while I was in a relationship with my now ex-boyfriend. He had quite a few exes, but he was my first so I relied on him about relationship matters because I admit I was still quite naive. I also told him about the things I mentioned above. Before we did anything sexual, I already told him I will only allow us to go 'til second base and he agreed.

When we had our first intimate encounter, he was really respectful of my boundaries. But as time went by, he became really pushy. He would force to undress me when I don't want to. I have self-esteem issues and I want to open up to him little by little, but he doesn't seem to care about my discomfort and only cares about his own pleasure.

He also kept on convincing me to give him a blowjob. I told him I don't want to do it, but he just didn't stop on convincing me until I finally gave in. Our entire relationship almost revolved around me giving him blowjobs everytime we meet since then. I felt like he was treating me like an object, so I told him I really wanted to spend quality time with him (sitting in the couch and watching movies, talking about random things, getting to know each other more, stuff like that). He often agreed, but it always led to something sexual.

There was also a time when we were making out and he tried to finger me. I didn't want him to do it so I held his hand in order to stop him, but he kept on pushing my hand away. He eventually did what he wanted to do. I complained about it being painful, but he kept on doing it so I just let him because I felt like even if I refused, it won't matter anyway.

He also tried to give me oral sex. I'm not comfortable with it, so I refused. I said no twice and held his hand, but he kept on lowering my jeans. I wanted to cry, but I stopped myself because we were at his room and his parents were at the living room so I don't want to make a scene because it would be so embarrassing if they found out what we were doing. When I felt his lips on my genital, I felt cold. I froze. He still kept on touching and kissing me, but I never felt any pleasure from it. It's like I was there but I wasn't. I could remember giving him a blowjob and me hitting my head on the wall and almost gagging because he was being too rough. I also heard him say something like, ""I would've cum into your mouth, but I felt pity on you."" with a smug look on his face. I think this is because we agreed that he wouldn't cum in my mouth because I don't want to. I just felt numb the rest of the day while I was with him. When I arrived home, that's when it sank in. I told him through text that I felt disrespected, and he said sorry. He told me he just got carried away and he won't do it again. But after that event, there were times when he'd try to touch me and I'd push his hand away but like what he did before, he'd disregard my refusal.

There were a lot of times when I was aroused by what he was doing even if I don't want it. And I feel like it's my fault because I let him get his way when I could've fought and resisted more. I could've set my boundaries clearer. I'm really confused. I feel light-headed. I want to go into details more but this is already too long. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to feel.

"Any downsides of drinking monster ultra / sugar-free energy drinks? Okay so let's talk some Monster Zero Ultra, my friends. Today ya girl broke down and said uh huh it's time let's try this baby, and of course this sub knows its shit bc that's some holy water in a 16 oz can when fasting.

And I've been really good about avoiding sugar (even artificial sugars) when I do eat, so the last thing I want is an enormous craving for sugar to return that I'll have to fight all over again...or just as bad, an enormous energy crash that makes me tempted to end my fast or challenge why I have to keep restricting in the first place. For those of you who've tried it, what (if any) downsides would you take into consideration when considering regularly drinking sugar-free energy drinks?

"Been an alcoholic for past 3 years Like my title says I've been struggling with drinking for past few years.  My drink of choice is vodka. I occasionally drink beer as well. 

Long story short I quit smoking weed about a year and a half ago and before that I was slowly weaning myself off. However I've found myself drinking a lot more now. 

I usually drink a liter of alcohol every two days or a 2 liter every 4-5 days and crazy thing is, I don't get drunk when I drink 6-10 drinks a day. I usually drink to relax due to my depression and anxiety and my health problems make my anxiety worse. 

Along with some bad news about my little sister being sexually assaulted by a family member and not having a great relationship with my girlfriend, I feel like its very hard to quit at this point.

I have a great job as of recent and would hate for something to go wrong because of my addiction. I honestly feel like quitting weed was a bad decision because now I substituted a somewhat harmless habit with a dangerous one.

To make matters worse I spend a lot of money on alcohol even when I'm broke I either use my credit card or sell stuff for alcohol money.

There are some days where I can barely function because I'm so tired and antisocial. The thing that makes me feel normal is coming home and drinking until I fall asleep because honestly I'm more happy and fulfilled when I'm at work and don't even think of drinking then.

Anyone have any advice or experience with quitting heavy drinking? I would hate to put my life on a further hold because of my addiction. 

I would love to quit but I know I have to make some hard decisions about my personal life as well, like my relationships and coming to terms with my failed relationship with my mother throughout my entire childhood and young adulthood.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Another ""Do I have autism?""-post Hello. 

I'm new to this subreddit but I'm guessing you get these posts all of the time. 

Basically, my question is: Do you think I should see someone to get my ""potential""(?) autism checked out?

---------------------------------------------------------------------

SOCIALLY

- Struggle to fit in with groups, usually only hang out with my close group of trusted friends

- Prefer 1 on 1 conversations, when more people get involved I get frustrated that the conversation is evolving too slowly. Also I feel there isn't enough space for someone to really get to a strong point that resolves the topic. I therefore tend to talk way too much to move it along. 

- Small talk is difficult and awkward, though I am generally seen as polite and nice even in these encounters 

- Very uncomfortable with eye contact

- Did not speak a single word until I was three years old

- Find most social encounters draining and difficult. For some reason I still enjoy socializing for the most part. The challenge and the experiences are unique and the act of being of social is interesting to me.

WORK/INTERESTS/DOING THINGS

- I get obsessed with my interests to the point where it causes problems. Other healthy activity and daily routines gets ignored and my physical and mental health suffers from this. Difficulty controlling this behavior.

- Difficulty doing chores. Things I do not enjoy are really hard to get done.

- Struggle being flexible at work. I feel like I want to have a rigorous system that I can follow to ensure the task is done correctly and according to instructions. Get very unsure if something has been done correctly if I can't double check with some kind of procedure-manual.

THINKING/GENERAL

- I have weird fantasies. If I am in a room, a thought I like to entertain myself with is this: If the walls of this room were mirrors and I had a laser, could I point the laser in a direction so that it comes back to the starting point with the same initial direction, completing a loop? If yes, what would the pattern look like? If no, how could I move the starting position to enable the possibility of a loop?

- Really like numbers and patterns. Always liked math, but as a hobby. Never chose to pursue it. 

- Often find myself remembering numbers, shapes or sounds that my family or friends do not pick up on, because they are uninteresting and doesn't catch their attention.

- I have coping behaviors. I like to tap with my fingers in specific patterns on the table, hum or whistle short, repeating melodies while driving, working, being at the computer. When walking I have other small thumb-to-finger movements I perform. I do these consciously but have a hard time stopping. Usually happens when I am stressed or concentrated, which is most of the time.

"The victim of assault and the bystander effect. (I just panicked rn) On December 3rd 2016, I was waiting for the bus to go home after taking the SATs I was waiting around plenty of other people at that stop, then one of those people tapped on my shoulder, I looked back and he started to fight me, he was a older guy, around in the 40s, it was one sided and he put me to the ground. I was yelling for help and then he just ran away. I didn't know at the time, that I should of stayed there and get help but, I didn't have my phone ( it was stolen by 4 teens on this day) , so I waited for the bus and went in, the guy that just assaulted me was waiting for the same bus at the next stop. Luckily, the people who witnessed the attack shouted at the bus driver to not let him in. While I'm thankful that they have helped me there, I wish that they did something at the stop( I think the bystander effect was happening)

"Does anyone get triggered by things that have nothing to do with your trauma? (TW) I was diagnosed with PTSD 13 years ago. Since then I have figured out all of my triggers and have done my best to work through them. However, I have one trigger that is super random and has nothing to do with what caused my trauma! 

Here is some background-

When I was 5 I was sexually assaulted

When I was 10 I witnessed my dad try and murder my mom. He was on some sort of drugged and just flipped out on her. I'm not going to go into detail because it still makes me shake but it was horrifying.

When I was 14 I was raped.

All of my triggers from these are triggers you could imagine. I have one trigger though that is super random?! Whenever I am in a car and it starts to storm or if i am in a car with a driver who drives somewhat fast I immediately get triggered and break down into an episode. I have no idea why this happens? This trigger is bigger than all of my other ones too?

My mood has gotten really bad, really really bad, suicidal more so than usual. I used to struggle with self harm and now I have to keep dosing myself with Clonazepam to keep myself from doing it again. I really want to hurt myself, beat myself, kill myself, I feel horrible. I tried contacting my prescriber to let her know how bad it was but I don't think she understood how bad it is and she's on vacation. I'm losing my mind.

"I'm not a real doctor and I do not want to confuse people here. Should I say this every time I share my insights? I have had PTSD since childhood. My particular stresses had caused my to become hyperanaltical. In when I grew up I found my self attracted to philosophy. As I studied and fed my desire for security and information I found a lot of helpful information and peace. I never finished a grad program, in fact I didn't take my bachelors degree despite having earned more than enough credits. My life wasn't well sorted out and the political nature of university life bleed into the issues I had growing up with trust and authority. I continue to study to this day but not to find answers, really to stay healthy and grounded. 



I dont think that philosophy has the answers or is the answer but I have a lot of good information. I have no medical advice to offer. But I want to share something that I know from experience are very helpful.


But I have this Reddit username which is a personal inside joke, and that I love. It however may portray me as something that I am not to certain people who are very stressed and looking for help. I don't want people to take my word as authority. I do my best to put that in every answer but it distracts from what's being said. So what do you all think is best. 

Note: the community rules say not to give medical advice.

"Won’t be forgetting tonight. Ever. I’ve had problems drinking forever.  I always allow it to seduce me into thinking “I’ve got control this time.”  My problem is I don’t have an off switch.  Where most people can stop at a beer or two, I want a case.   

I did not get black out drunk tonight.  I wasn’t mean.  I wasn’t bitchy.  That didn’t stop my husband from comparing me to his abusive alcoholic father though.  

I’m young &amp; find that pre-kids people my age all want to have drinks out or have parties with.  

In the past, I’ve become black out drunk &amp; I’ve said very out of character hurtful things.  I once threw a shoe &amp; a phone towards my husband in an argument.  

Tonight we went out with friends for dinner and prior to going out I had had three beers between 12 - 6.   At dinner I had two margaritas.  

When we got home my husband and I argued about something unrelated to my drinking and he said the following “I hate it when you drink because it reminds me of my father.”  (Backstory: his father was an abusive POS who drank and did heavy drugs and left the family when husband was 6.) 

That really hurt.  I haven’t been black out drunk in a long time.  I wasn’t tonight.  I do feel I’ve been in more control.  I certainly don’t think it was a fair comparison.  

I get that he wants me to quit drinking but being cruel like that wasn’t the way.  That really hurt.  

He says he thinks of the shoe incident anytime I am drinking and it makes him not want me to drink.  I truly get that.  I don’t think he handled this correctly though.

"Which level (1,2, or 3) of ASD is most prevalent? ""ASD Level 3: “Requiring Very Substantial Support”

Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social interactions, and minimal response to social overtures from others. For example, a person with few words of intelligible speech who rarely initiates interaction and, when he or she does, makes unusual approaches to meet needs only and responds to only very direct social approaches.7﻿

Inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus or action.7﻿

ASD Level 2: “Requiring Substantial Support”

Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal responses to social overtures from others. For example, a person who speaks in simple sentences, whose interaction is limited to narrow special interests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal communication.7﻿

Inflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty changing focus or action.7﻿

ASD Level 1: “Requiring Support”

Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Difficulty initiating social interactions and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. For example, a person who is able to speak in full sentences and engages in communication but whose to-and-fro conversation with others fails, and whose attempts to make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful.7﻿

Inflexibility of behavior causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Difficulty switching between activities. Problems of organization and planning hamper independence.7""

"how do I cope with the need to control my environment?????? hi everybody, 

I’ve been lurking for quite a while but today my friend confronted me with something and I’m kinda concerned. I was diagnosed with ptsd due to a traumatic hospital stay I experienced and even though it’s already been a year i am just now understanding what that means for my daily life. recently my dissociation has been really bad - and I’ve realized it’s kicked up a lot of feelings about how I felt so out of control. because of this I have found that I often do small things to keep the environment around me in a particular order - and I like to do things in a certain way or I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. 

I did not think it was a big problem though until my friend strongly suggested that I might be too controlling for my own good and that apparently I have a “need to control literally everything” around me. ahaha now I’m crying alone in my house freaking out and feeling like such a douche bag for letting it affect my relationships and feel out of control of my ability to control my own control issues (if that makes sense ahah). am I alone in this? is it going to go away? why did her comment hurt me so bad? some coping skills or advice would be appreciated because I feel like I’m drowning teehee ¡",ptsd,ptsd

"ADHD and the ability to apply for jobs Hello fellow brains :) I am not diagnosed with adhd but there is no doubt in my mind that I do have ADHD. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression tho and if you have depression and ADHD you should know that it is extremely awful and heartbreaking combination. 

Well I am not here to talk about that but instead about how you guys are able to sit down and apply for jobs. 

I have had a real problem with this all my life, as of this moment I have been unemployed for 3 ½ months. I have no money left and currently living of my parents. 

Everyday I tell myself multiple times, today/tomorrow I will start looking for a job. I can even bring several different job applications up on my screen but I have real trouble to actually apply for the jobs. The only thing that motivates me now and in the past is the simple fact that  I am broke and I need money for simply living and being able to self medicate (cannabis). This motivation isn't enough to actually be a active job applicant. 

My question is, do you guys also have similiar problems and how do you deal with it? 

PS. I also have trouble keeping jobs, it's all fun and exciting the first month or so but then gets boring to the point I dread going to work...

"Has anyone else on here gotten ptsd from a freak accident? I'm 14 years old and this is my first time posting.  I wanted to share my story to see if I could connect with someone that's gone through something similar to mine, so please comment if you can relate to my story.
 
Back in December of last year , I was out shopping for a Christmas party , and the mood was very happy and light. I was with my youth leader whom I was very close with. We had just set up for our party and then went to cryeleike  to pick her husband up from work. ( it was dark and rainy ) As I was getting out of the car, she pulled the car toward and literally ran my foot over with her Volvo. Now , at the time , I didn't freak out too much , so as to not make her even more upset and guilty feeling for doing it. She offered to take me to the doctors office because I was limping a bit. I refused but the next day I went with my mom. They said it was just a contusion and perhaps a sprain.  Well it seemed to heal in two weeks and I freaked out a lot but was okay overall. In January I went ice skating , where I injured it again. I really freaked out and cried. Fast forward a month later, healed again after just keeping it in a wrap. Well July rolls around and I haven't given my foot a second thought since February so I figured all was well. I was so wrong. Long story short , it started hurting again even though I was just walking about my day and I went to about 4 xrays , all saying that nothing was broken. After my last xray , the orthopedic reffered me to a physical therapy office to do therapy for my foot 2 times a week for a month. Now that that is over , I suppose my foot is almost healed completely,  but my emotional and mental state are not stable.

I feel suicidal and just want the pain to stop. I have such a huge fear of the woman who ran my foot over and that makes everything so complicated as we were so close and she was the only person I had ever truly trusted with anything. Now I don't feel safe telling her anything. Other things that really get me upset are when I'm in public and especially in parking lots and I have this huge fear that she is gonna come out of anywhere and run me over. The flashbacks from that night back in December haunt me every single day , sending me into tears and panic attacks often. Just like tonight. And when I think back to the accident , my mind warps what happened with her having a sinister look on her face while doing it and things like that which really scare me. I have to see her often so this is terrible. I really don't know what to do and sometimes I just think my mind is messed up beyond repair and I should just kill myself. Well , not sometimes,  all the time.",ptsd,ptsd

"Helping a SO with PTSD Hi everyone, 

My SO is currently in a really bad place after being robbed by a group of armed men. I'm not sure if this qualifies as the actual disorder, but even so, it's a similar situation. And since I've been lucky enough to not have dealt with anything that could scar me emotionally, I don't fully grasp what she is going through. I've read a lot of articles on dealing with the stress after traumatic events/helping your loved ones do so, but I admit I can't even begin to understand what it must feel like.

Obviously all I want is to see her feeling better, so I'd like to ask for some advice... So far, what I've done is give her some space (she likes to stay in closed quarters for a while when things go downhill, to process everything and whatnot) while still making it abundantly clear that I am there for her should she need anything.  I don't wanna push it or anything, she needs her space, so I don't wanna pressure her into trying to go out too soon or anything (it just happened last week). But I'm making myself as available as possible too.

Does anybody with more experience in situations like this have any advice? Anything I could do, or any way to act to ease things up for her? Is what I'm doing wrong somehow?

"Making friends as an adult...? I’m 30 years old, moved cross country earlier this year and have had a really hard time going out and making friends. I have social anxiety so it’s really hard for me to find places that aren’t so noisy or crowded that they trigger a meltdown. I don’t drink, and every place where you would feasibly go to meet other people in my city is a bar or a nightclub. I only have like one friend who lives less than an hour away, and we have different schedules so it’s very rare that we actually get the chance to hang out. I’ve tried using Meetup to find folks but haven’t found any places that match my interests.

To be honest, I don’t like going out at all. My idea of a good time with friends is going to their place or having them come over to mine, cooking a hot meal, playing music, getting stoned and watching some anime. But it feels like nobody else in my city feels that way, or if they do I haven’t found them yet. It’s also scary for me to go to places alone because I’m trans living in the South, and have to always be mindful of my own safety.

"Drug induced hallucinations Hi everyone, I've never been diagnosed as psychotic, but the other day I had some weird but not super scary hallucinations. In my periphery I saw a hand draw back a shower curtain. Later I heard my ringtone but when I found my phone no one had called.

I had some restlessness in my legs, and was prescribed Cogentin to counteract the jittery feeling that might have been a side effect of the Abilify.

I guess my question is, since hallucinations are a fairly rare side effect, do I have an increased likelihood of psychosis later in life?

"Feeling invalidated by my treatment team - help? Hi,

I've been in recovery for almost a year now with the help of a treatment team offered through my university's health center. This includes a medical doctor, a dietician, and a therapist. I was never ""that sick"" even at my lowest weight but when I first started seeing them I was diagnosed with AN-R and they helped me a lot with issues I was having. 

Lately, things have been really, really bad. Being home with family over these last holidays was immensely triggering and I've been dealing with a restrictive episode for weeks now (since \~early Nov.) And through all of this, I've gotten so little support. Here's just a few instances of what I've experienced, just so you know what I'm talking about:

* Medical doctor only asking me about how I am and how my health has been if my weight is low enough, otherwise dismisses me with ""you're doing great!"" even if I explicitly state that I'm not doing great
* Dietician giving me the OK for exercise with no hesitation, saying that I ""appear to be healthy"", then checking my weight chart later that day and taking it back, saying she didn't know my weight was that low and I actually can't exercise
* Dietician making sure that I'm exercising regularly when I tell her I'm eating more, even though she knows as part of my ED I am active at best and compulsive at worst
* Therapist repeatedly ""reassuring"" me by saying I do not look ill/emaciated, and I was never that all severe so I will probably eventually completely recover whether I try to or not and I don't necessarily need external support to do so

It just feels so clear that they don't give a shit at all. I have been through hell with this disorder and it breaks me to constantly feel like I'm being told I'm not sick enough to be cared about, not sick enough to eat more, and not sick enough to get better. I feel like I have so many reasons to recover but now I'm even deeper into restriction because I feel like I need to prove to them that I am sick enough just to have their support. I feel so terrible for admitting that, but I almost want my weight to be so low and I want to look so gaunt that they take me seriously and stop dismissing my emotional and physical pain. 

I just don't know where to go from here, so I'm asking for help. How would you deal with a situation like this? Am I in the wrong and just attention seeking? Thanks in advance for any responses, I really do appreciate it. ",EDAnonymous,EDAnonymous

And the past years I had various small delusions that wouldn't go away till recently ... I quit all substances and now this shrink from addiction care says there's nothing wrong with me besides being a recovering addict - while I almost built my entire existence around the thoughts about psychosis, schizophrenia - got anxiety issues. Can hardly believe that this doctor is telling me it was all my own fault and effect of the drugs I used to take.

I've been used to being some sort of victim of a defective mind .. but as it is not being poisoned now, it seems that I only have motivation issues and trouble looking on the bright side of events. 

Always when I'm alone for too long I start to think negative thoughts. I can sort of **""hear"" these negative thoughts** and comments - it's with everything I do and it's driving me crazy.

I'm stuck in a life that's mostly determined by illness. I find it hard to motivate myself. Every monday someone is coming to check on me and she sort of wants me to do something like a volunteer job but I don't feel motivated/fit for that. I'm totally locked in my thoughts.

"Need advice. Is this PTSD? Therapy? Hello guys, I'm new here!
I need advice on a very sensitive topic. TW sexual abuse, genitalia mentioning. 

. 
. 
Alright, so I'm a female and 20 now. 
I was sexually abused/ raped/ domestically abused by my former partner 3 years ago when I was 17. He threatened to stab me with a knife and locked me up in a room with him. I reported this to the police back then but nothing really happened.
I was also, probably abused as a child, but I only have a very vivid memory about it. 
I was treated with trauma therapy for about a year after it all happened, until I was 18. Then I felt like it didn't help me and quit. 

Now, 3 years later, I'm having a partner again. I've been with him for nearly a year.
Had some romantic acquaintences before I met him and romance was hardly ever a problem. 
But with my current partner, who knows everything about my past and is truly a supportive angel, it's suddenly difficult. I can't be close to him. I feel trapped when he holds me too closely. I get panic attacks right after sex. Every time, instantly after I orgasm. Usually it's crying and not being able to breathe. Songs from 3 years ago trigger me a lot, as well as reports about rape on the news for example. 
I'm in permanent flight mode. 
I literally can't breathe when he holds me tightly, even if it's a soft embrace that means no harm. 
I can't have sex with him lately, it feels gross and it just constantly hurts. I can barely ever relax when we are intimate. 
Therapy is so very expensive around here and he offers to pay 50% for me but I don't want that. 
Does this sound like PTSD to you?
I have no idea what to do next.

"Cube storage makes it so much easier to put clothes away and keep them tidy! I've been working on arranging things at home to make life easier and to reduce the frequency that I end up with overwhelming piles of stuff that haven't been put away. Something that has worked really well for me is using cube storage for my clothes instead of traditional drawers. Like this:  

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pfZ46H5.jpg)  

It makes the task of putting clothes away so much easier because it breaks it down with a single cube for each type of item. Stuff like underwear can just be thrown in the right cube and it's done. For things that need folding, I take out one cube at a time and use it to guide folding width. It also allows me to store folded items vertically so that I can see everything (and remember that things exist!) without the difficulty of trying to stand them up in drawers. I can stack items with the cube on it's side (pics of that below).

"Seeking non-medical advice about seeking treatment. Hi, all.  Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm a 25 year old man who's been struggling with an inability to focus and get simple tasks done and I've had it up to here with it. No matter how much time I allocate for even the simplest tasks I apparently don't have the fortitude to take less than the whole day to do them. Even when setting aside weeks for a critical project, I find myself cramming on the last day to finish. I've felt that I need to get help and I want to be as prepared as I possibly can to get an accurate diagnosis from a medical professional. I've never gone to the doctor for anything more than an occassional checkup and I lose my nerve to ask about ADHD every time for fear of not being taken seriously, which is silly. 

That said, I don't have a recorded history of ADHD from childhood, nor do I have a previous diagnosis. I've always found it really hard to focus and absorb crucial information, but it didn't start to negatively affect my life until about the end of high school (which was manageable) through college (which was hell) to the present (still pretty bad). Have any of you in this community had a similar experience which drove you to seek treatment? What are some insights you have for someone who thinks they should get checked out for ADHD (or other things, frankly) and is new to the process?

"Needing peer support: this semester has thrown my ADHD a curve ball. I feel like I’ve had my ADHD under control for years. By under control I mean, I’m able to be productive and overall able to deal with symptoms. This semester has thrown my life out of wack. I’m not able to be productive, I procrastinate, and unmotivated which causes me significant distress and disappointment. 

Ironically, I’m going to be a school counselor. I graduated in December, and started grad school in January. I went from taking SEVEN classes (19 credit hours), to 2 (6 hrs). I went from working 30 hours, to 15. 

My two classes are online. I usually work short shifts in the afternoon. This significant change in workload/routine has really messed me up. 

I used to wake up early. Work on school work all day until it was time to go to work. I barely had any free time. Now, I have nothing to do. I only have about 4 school assignments a week. I sit around all day until it’s time to go to work. 

I’ve been looking for jobs, and submitting resumes but I gave up. I have a good job, but our hours were cut and being the only student I got the short end of the stick. 

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ALL DAY. I find myself looking for things to do! My symptoms have gotten significantly worse since I don’t have constant stimulation. My procrastination has come back. When I DO have something to do, like register for classes next semester, take a major exams, I put it off. 

**TLDR** : I used to have too much on my plate, school and work. Now I don’t have enough on my plate and my symptoms have gotten worse. I struggle to be productive. 

The thing is, studying counseling and psychology, I know the interventions that I need. I know what I would tell a client or student if they were struggling with this issue. Idk maybe I lack motivation.

"How to help son w friends My son is 7yo and we’re in the midst of getting him assessed for asd. He’s a very verbal, bright and curious child, incessant with questions when he’s with us. That said he struggles with anxiety and with regulating his emotions and he’s never great about talking about his feelings or the ongoings at school.

For the past 4 years, he was attending a daycare where he made some close friends, mostly boys. By close I mean when we have play dates I do observe them running around together and with some back and forth with imaginative play. That said, he sometimes does go off to do his own thing during play dates. He’s also quite rigid with how and who is allowed to play with his toys.  I always attributed it to him being very possessive with his toys and honestly, his teachers have never brought up his socializing as a problem.

At the start of primary 1 in January this year, due to the huge changes that came along (new school, new class, new routines, no familiar faces), he regressed with his oral fixation and started putting everything into his mouth. As a result some of the kids in class were mean to him and called him names - “ewwww I don’t wanna hold his hands”, “he’s yucky”. That’s the extent of it.

Today I checked in with his teachers for an update about his class dynamics. She said the kids have gotten used to my son’s oral fixation and mostly leave him alone now. She added that my son tends to prefer to be alone. She observed several instances whereby his classmates would want to give him a high five or show him something or talk to him and my son would just ignore them or present with an expressionless face. I also noticed in the past months at home, my younger son would often speak to my 7yo directly but my 7yo would typically ignore him until one of us had to prompt him, and even then he would still try to ignore us or answer back very impatiently.

I spoke to my son about this. I get the sense that he’s simply uninterested in what others have to say hence the non-response.... the rationale may be legitimate but as a parent I worry that this is socially unacceptable becomes a vicious pattern of behavior that may just end up isolating my son more than he intended...

"Looking for help - info on AA Hello folks,

I'm an addict/alcoholic. Last week I got a DUI after hitting a tree. I could have killed me or someone else. I've been sober since, and today marks 7 days of sobriety.

Before that, I smoked pot nightly, and drank 4-5 nights a week, 2-3 drinks a night. More with friends or on weekends.

I have depression and anxiety, and I've been isolating myself more and more, and the depression has been getting worse and worse. After a chemical dependency evaluation, I'm convinced that a sober life is the only life I'm capable of living without letting booze/drugs destroy me. I'm enrolled in an outpatient treatment program, and they want me to start going to AA meetings.

Here's a couple of things I'm really curious about:

1) I'm an atheist. I'm not agnostic or spiritual in any way. I do not believe in any sort of higher power. Is AA still a place that I would be welcomed?

2) Assuming that the answer to 1 is yes, can I just show up at a meeting? I've looked up meetings around me, and it looks like they fall into a bunch of different categories. Is there a type of meeting that is best for newcomers?

3) I'm a very anxious person. What should I expect to happen at the meeting? Should I be ready to share my story with folks? Should I mention my atheism? Should I just go and plan to remain silent?

"[TW!] having an ED with high BMI makes me feel like i have no support, even on here sometimes i'll say things on this sub and it'll get downvoted once or twice. it's always the type of comments where i say how i'm triggered by the weight loss of someone (without an ED) when it is clear their weight loss attributes to a better quality of life. and how it is reinforced that thinness life easier. i said this about a female family member and a popular youtuber who lost 100 lbs.


i'm not saying thinness is some magical elixir for success in life, but because of my ED, i can't help but feel that way sometimes, especially since i have actually experienced love and success when i was smaller. the thing is... thin people with EDs say shit like this all of the time, how if they lose those last 5 or 10 lbs they will have a much better life.

and it just sucks because having a high BMI and being on ED support subs, i am not only not allowed to be candid on the only support groups i have, i have to kind of adapt to unintentionally hurtful language. ie someone with a low bmi saying she ""feels fat"" - which, of course, is not fatphobic. when it comes to most people with eating disorders of all sized at IS a feeling and it is truly an awful feeling to have that drives us fucking crazy. so i feel like a lot of higher BMI folks in online ED support spaces have to adapt, yet we have to walk on eggshells

"When you get diagnosed with autism Recently got diagnosed with autism at 28 years old.

Secretly I knew it when I was 12 but it was never a big problem.


After my 20s pretty much depression became a normal thing, changing jobs every year until last year when I had my biggest mental breakdown and body completely shutdown of stress.

It has been almost a year this happened and still recovering. The psychologist send papers to a specialized center which would help me to do something I like but I highly doubt it would happen and feel like I’m going to be placed in one of these boxes if u know what I mean.


My problem is that I know and can do a lot, I’m originally a chief electrical engineer, next to that I do a lot in the music business like making, recording, mixing and mastering but also have an advising role for some artists. Next to that I’m a workaholic and super sportive.

Since electrical engineering is not an option anymore because this creates the depression, I’m forced to do something else, music is just a side thing but what I like the most is editing and fixing. It has this psychological aspect of finding issues and solve them, sometimes create the illusion in order to have enough space in the mix.


To be honest I find it really hard to talk open about this, yet I felt the need to put at least a little background story about what I do and how it kinda got messed up. 

I’m wondering how other people try to control their ticks and did you find a way to ignore some of it by doing something or did you had to shut down completely from it? Like social media is not as it used to be and for that reason I only use the chat and stay

"Just listening to my drunk boyfriend's snoring We've been together for three years. I love him, he's a nice and funny guy, I trust him with almost anything. Except for drinking. By himself or with me, he just goes to the odd craft beer place, it's his biggest hobby and within limits I can deal with that. But once he goes over a certain level, he won't stop without turning very, very defensive and disrespectful.

Knowing that he's loves being compared to his father who's a pretty bad, but funny alcoholic (means everyone loves him regardless and alcoholism is suddenly not perceived as that bad), that worries also me. His tendencies of never knowing when to stop once he started properly aren't great, either.

He just started at a new place and there's a group of early 20s lads who like to go on the beers every Friday. I know that's my boyfriend's (30) downfall. He has an important class every Saturday 10am, so he can't get too drunk on Fridays. Yet here we are.

6pm: Just had two or three beers, will be home soon.

7pm: Yeah, sorry, they are so funny, can't go yet.

"College/University accomodations I'm starting University this fall and have already contacted the disabilities office. They say that they work with each student individually to see what they need, but common accomodations for students with Asperger's include telling the professors, giving more time and a quiet room for exams and not having the students perform in front of all the students but only the professors. 

Now, while this is all very nice, I am only starting university and just know the general process. I don't know any details and therefore also don't know which things could be challenging to me. 

I imagine that one major problem will be taking notes during class. I can't process the language and write it down fast enough,  I miss words or write entirely nonsensical notes because my brain is trying to write down what the person just said while my hand is still at the sentence before that, and if I focus on writing, I don't know what's being said anymore.

"Looking for advice for my three year old. I first want to preface with the fact that I'm on mobile, and I have never personally dealt with someone who is on the spectrum. I apologize if anything I say comes across as rude or ignorant, I'm trying to get a better understanding of things. This may be a wall of text.

My son is three. He barely speaks. He's been in speech therapy since he was 18 months and goes to an early pre-k sponsored by the state (KY). When he was 18 months, they did the m-chat and he showed 3+ red flags for autism. Nothing was said again and he was put into speech therapy. Now his current doctor wants another evaluation because of how slow he is progressing and his behavior issues.

Now I realize that some of the issues he's having is related to his speech and age, but I'm not sure whether to contribute them all to that, or to a possible diagnosis of autism. He repeats the words he knows in rapid succession. He doesn't respond 90% of the time when we call his name. He's recently started looking us in the eyes sometimes when we talk to him. He's very easily over stimulated. Hates crowds or busy places. When he's upset, mad, tired or even hungry, he hits, kicks, screams, bites. He throws himself on the floor, runs into walls. Hits himself and others (mostly me). I try talking to him, trying to teach him his feelings and that we don't use our hands, feet or teeth for expressing our feelings. I know that this is partly due to his difficulties communicating.

I'm scared to death of an autism diagnosis. Not because I think there's anything wrong with it, but I don't want life to be harder for him. He's my life. How can I help him? We have an evaluation set up but they are so backed up it won't be for 6-9 months. I just hesitate placing a label on him for normal behaviors that will be resolved when he can effectively communicate.

"I'm an alcoholic My life has always been a little bit of a mess. My parents have their fair share of problems - drugs and alcohol being two of them. I decided early on that I would never drink, so in my rebel teenage years I was obstinate in other ways than drinking my ass off.

Sober for the most part, but I couldn't stop drinking when I had my first drip of alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

This was a few years ago, but the trend continued and I have now realized that my drinking habits has costed me more than a few friendships, job opportunities, and has overall made me a bad person. Almost a month ago I decided to never ever drink again and quit cold turkey. So now I am the only sober one on work parties, and I am cool with it.

"S.P.I.N. So I’ve been in a 7 year rut and I just wanted to share something I read because I got so sick of myself I wanted to figure out a problem I was having. 

I read about this thing called SPIN that stands for shame, pessimism &amp; negativity, isolation, and no outlet. 

Growing up I was criticized for just about everything I enjoyed doing or didn’t do well enough. I either didn’t live up to my own standards or my parents. Eventually I grew pessimistic which is when I started performing poorly in school. I believed that it wasn’t worth trying anything because I wouldn’t be good at it regardless so why try it anyway. From the shame and pessimism I began to isolate myself. For 7 years I isolated myself from friends and family. I didn’t want to burden them with my existence. I just wanted to not affect anyone so that I couldn’t be affected. The only thing I have been hanging on to is outlets and I switch them frequently because eventually I get sick of them. My anxiety beat out my outlets tho and I have been drinking through the anxiety from my lack of acting on my potential. If it makes the anxiety go away rather than doing it why not right? Wrong. You’ll lose yourself and forget who you were. I called my family today because I couldn’t handle the random bullshit in my head going off and not being able to just stop. 

I feel ADHD has a very fine line of dropping you off the edge without you realizing it if you isolate yourself. Find people in your life who support you and your interests. Ask people for help that care about you. If you don’t speak no one will know if you’re hurting. It’s hard as all hell. Fighting procrastination, distractions, and anxiety is difficult when you’re alone and self-loathing. 

I had to end it here because I forgot what else I had to say. If I remember the rest I’ll edit it in later.

Also I’m in deep need of any advice. I’ve only recognized the issue.

"So, I might have a problem here.. I'm quite overweight, I think. Around 160 cm/ weight 91 kg.  
And I really really fear the thought that's creeping in my head.  


""*Stop eating, stop eating""* Even when I'm eating healthy food in reasonable portions.  
The thing is, i really, *really* want to stop eating altogether. Just a week or two. And it scares me to no end, that's exactly how Anorexia begins. And, with my extremely frail mental health, it's a serious concern and i *don't* want to seek help because seeing myself with less fat on *every part of this cursed cage* is something i long for.. And it's extremely dangerous.  


I sincerely fear one day i really might start refusing to eat, making excuses.. I'm stupid smart, so i can fake eating, do chems, and lie well enough to cover the fact I'm not eating anymore.  


I see myself every day, at the mirror, I feel like a monster,  and I've been thinking of checking my weight constantly on the last 2 weeks, thinking on what i might do to not have anyone concerned about me eating less and less on daily basis..

"Feeling lost - can't identify the cause nor determine a solution for my biggest struggle I was diagnosed with ADHD last summer and I've been on Vyvanse for probably about 8 months now. I think I feel it's effectiveness the most when I'm working independently, which is not very often given that I go to school and am usually interacting with people in some way. At home on weekends, if I remember to take it, my focus improves somewhat and I feel more motivated to do my work.

But.. my biggest problem still exists: It still takes me a ridiculous amount of time to complete my work! I get around an extra 30 minutes for my school tests and it makes a difference. So things like tests and quizzes I can almost get those done in a reasonable time frame (still takes a bit longer than others, but that's okay I think).

However.... assignments and homework take me so so so much longer than normal. It almost takes me 3-4x longer than my average peer to complete the same task, and I'm not exaggerating, it really does take that long. I've been trying to work quicker but all it does it just confuse me because I didn't process enough information in that shorter (normal person) block of time to come up with an effective answer. And honestly I'll be thinking I'm working at a normal pace if I feel more focused, but then I see that other people are ahead and I'm actually behind. I just don't understand how people can do the exact same work so much quicker if my understanding of the material is just as strong as the normal student. I get 80s and 90s which are A's (Canada) belong with the minority who get similar/higher grades.

So it's not comprehension, and I will be slower if the amount of work is heavy, but usually it doesn't matter how much work I have, it still takes me a long time to finish it.

I'm seeing my psychiatrist this upcoming Monday and I'm going to talk to her about this and how it's still a problem even though I'm on meds.

TLDR: I'm a student with ADHD and although I'm on medication and my focus + motivation somewhat improve, I still take 3-4x longer than the average student to complete basically any type of homework even though I have the same level of understanding. It's rarely a comprehension issue, it's something else but I can't put my finger on it. Seeing my psychiatrist this Monday, any advice or tips or information and anything else is appreciated!!",adhd,adhd

"Got off adderall for the first time in a year, Feel like shit. This post is mostly to share about my experience and a odd way to help me articulate my brain right way. 

So to start off i was on 40mg of adderall a day, and there is a noticable diffrence in being able to multitask, listen, and basicly made me a super human at times. However i could tell it was a demodivator, the die off period was always tearable, and got depressed once a month like a period.

For those reasons I stoped about a week ago. And iv felt the weirdest mood swings since getting off, such as being the most depressed iv ever been, to happy, to anxious, to feeling rejected, all in the span of hour(also doesn’t help that I had the biggest family fight the day after getting off adderall). It has died down a lot  and can tell I’m still alittle depressed.

I now feel much more sluggish, not able to focus, and frustrated with this. However I can tell that I’m more creative, and (once the weir off stops) more motivated and less mood swings. 

It’s odd after being on adderall for so long I forgot what it was like to be off it, and be my normal self. I imagine things will get better in the next month but just haft to get through it.

(Sorry for this being so long) 
my hopes for getting off adderall was to be happier,but at the cost of being worse at everything again.

"Mild delusions? I don't know please read this with an open mind So this is my first ever Reddit post and I only joined because I found this subreddit on Google and wanted to join. I've gotta say that pinned post or whatever it's called did help ease some of my fears but not all of them. I'm 16 and not diagnosed, and I don't totally think I have schizophrenia because I've been able to come up with other reasons for most my symptoms, but I have a lot (and I mean a lot) of what I think of as mild delusions because I believe in them but I like know they're not true. I know that most schizophrenics fully believe their delusions so I'm very aware they may not be caused by schizophrenia but they have been getting stronger as well as more frequent lately (my mental health in general has been steadily getting worse too, but I'm 98% sure it's because my dad and I have been fighting a lot and this house is just a very bad environment for me) and I was hoping someone could at least give me an idea of what I'm dealing with? I've been asking my mom to take me to therapy for a long time and she agrees I need to go but she's trying to get a house right now and doesn't have the money so I'm gonna have to wait at least another month but the past few months have been really weird and kinda scary tbh so I'd really really like to at least have some idea of what's going on.

"I'm only seeing the negative and feeling too hard. Help. Recently my partner and i got into a fight because i misinterpret everything someone close to him says. He says i always find the negative in things and it is true. Its easier for me to see the bad side of things and i do default to it. 

He told me its too hard to talk to me about it sometimes because i react so intensely and it makes sense why this person is avoiding me. 

It feels hard because i never felt like i was allowed to have feelings before. My entire childhood growing up. So when i went through therapy and i felt safe enough to feel like i could express them it felt like i was letting open a dam and so all of my feelings are strong and probably too much for most people.

I dont think i can change the intensity of my emotions. But i know i can look at situations in a different light. I just dont know how to do that.

"Feeling Alone I have never posted on reddit before, but I wanted to reach out because some of your posts really have helped me feel (not better or worse, just feel) today. I'm not certain if I should trigger warn so I'm adding NSFW in case.

In February 2019 my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD due to a sexually abusive, manipulative, compulsive liar relationship I was in in 2010. It was short, but very intense and I did not go to therapy properly for it til this past November. (2018) 2018 I was in a serious relationship for the first time since that abusive relationship and so some of the things that trigger me would not have come up until then because they are related to being in an intimate relationship. 

This relationship was so good and I was so excited because I felt like I learned that I could love and trust. Then for some reason, it started to become rocky and this is when my episodes really ramped up. I did not truly understand that I was having flashbacks until after it was all over but essentially this SO told me that ""whatever I was doing"" to address my PTSD wasn't working and that I had ""lost the ability"" to control my emotions and I was not as resilient as I used to be. I would get so mad and upset and irrational and he would too. After my worst flashback he did not speak to me for 2 weeks - because he needed space. (I don't blame him, but it was excruciating and I felt so much shame because I was reeling from the trigger) After the 2 weeks he broke up with me.

This all cut me to my core. Now, 7 months later, I'm finally coming out of the haze of sadness from that relationship ending. I'm in grad school for Social Work, I have my own apartment, I have two jobs and an internship. I'm doing what I wanted to do!! But I still am feeling so dejected and also really struggling to make friends because I'm nearly 30 and it's hard to make new friends but also I'm realizing, because I'm afraid to get close to people in case I have a trigger moment and they can't take it. 

I don't know if anyone has any thoughts but I just feel really small and alone and I have appreciated reading your posts so I thought I would reach out.

Peace and comfort to you. &lt;3",ptsd,ptsd

"Hi! I am just about to begin volunteering with an inclusive gym, and begin training to become an in-home play therapist for kids on the spectrum. If you have any advice, please pass it on! Hello everyone!

As the title says, I am gonna start volunteering with an inclusive gym that caters to every child and family. Their primary clientele is ASD kids and I am super excited to begin working there. 

Later in the year I also begin training to become a play therapist for kids too. It means I get to have one on one time with a kid to work through some learning stuff together and otherwise just have a fun time. 

Since I am not autistic myself (that I know), I guess my questions to you are just what did you find most helpful or good about the positive people in your life when you were growing up. What were or are the do’s and do not’s of how they interacted with you? 

Personally, from what I have seen, I have felt the treatment of neurodivergent kids in my schools and in the wider community to be absolutely sub-par, if not at times downright insulting and patronising.  A few of my friends have been through the various programs and it upsets me the amount of misunderstanding that went into their learning and how much sadness they felt because of it. 

At the core I really just want to do right by these kids and be a positive person for them as every child deserves, without babying them or making them feel invalidated by any means. I want to work with them, not above them or as a controlling presence. So if you had any tips, it would be very appreciated! 

In saying this I know everyone is different, which will be part of the learning process for me. But yeah, if you had any good memories or things others did to help you out if you needed it, please share! I am really excited to begin these new jobs. Thanks!",autism,autism

I am hoping to come up with some more ideas to help make high school and college more manageable.   
Here are some ideas I have already:

&amp;#x200B;

Homework:

Only being given the work that makes up the essential core of the class. That means exemption from all other work that serves a secondary purpose. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lectures:

Ability to record lectures and have a copy of notes for each lecture created by the instructor.

Ability to freely come and go during class.

&amp;#x200B;

Class Discussion:

Exemption from mandatory class discussion or permission to substitute with comments in a different format.

&amp;#x200B;

Group Projects:

Substitution of a group project with an individual project

&amp;#x200B;

Exams:

Distraction free environment

Open note tests

Rescheduling tests so that they are more evenly spaced/not on the same day

Extended testing time

There was an ice cream shop near my apartment, which I had never been inside. They rotated flavors daily, and posted them on a chalkboard against the window every day. I would walk at least 3 miles before I allowed myself to pass in front of the shop and look at the list of flavors. Then I would keep walking and fantasize about them. That was my ""treat"" for the day. I would get so excited to look at that board. Then I'd go home, chug a diet Coke, eat a sheet of dried seaweed, and get ready for work (which I walked 2 miles to get to, of course).

I'm in a better place now, but I'm still struggling with being at a normal weight. It helps to reflect back on this memory (and others), and remember how cruel I was to myself when I was in it deep. It makes me sad now, that I thought I deserved to feel so awful. I don't have anyone to talk to about these things so it feels good to share. Thanks for reading.

"“Have autism” vs. “Autistic” What is the preferred terminology? “Person with autism” or “autistic person”? Which do you personally prefer? Is there a general consensus amongst the autism community?

Lighting ptsd. Hello. Does anyone have ptsd from the lighting ?  I lived my whole life without worrying about the lighting and I even liked it. I lived majority of my life in the city in the apartments so I never experienced it so close. I live in a small town now. And last year our neighbors house got hit by the lighting. It was horrifying Since then I got a major ptsd from it. It’s the season now ... and the dark sky gives me anxiety. I try to shake it off. But having some other issues with my mental health doesn’t make it easier. I would appreciate any advice. Or experience. Thank you.,ptsd,ptsd
"Worried about my future Hey all, 

I've never posted anything before, but i feel like I could use some guidance on my circumstances. 
I just turned 21 a couple of months ago, and drink about 4-6 beers just about every night since I have been able to buy it myself. I know that some of my family has struggled with various addictions, and I myself had a destructive, in a loose sense of the word, relationship with pot. I get frustrated when I cant drink, and at the end of every day it is what i look forward to, as if it were my reason for making it through. I like drinking a lot, but I think it would help me recognize the long term consequences of this  detrimental relationship to hear some of your experiences and advice.

thank you in advance.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Diagnosed years ago, stopped taking meds. That was a mistake. Now I don't think they'll believe me. Am I worried over nothing? I finally got up the courage to talk to my GP about ADHD, and she set me up with an appointment with a Psychiatrist. They sent out the CAARS self and observer report, and I got up the courage to ask my wife to fill out the observer report. 

I think I should have asked a friend, because she seems to have rated me based on how much a particular behavior annoys her. I also mask a lot of my symptoms with excuses. I constantly need to get up and get out of the room, the house, or head off into town, but I get up because I ""need a cigarette,"" or I come up with an errand to run to town for. These errands always take a lot longer than they should because they aren't really my purpose for leaving. I know I'm making up an excuse, but she doesn't.

I can keep myself in place by flooding myself with information. I spend a lot of my time at home (which is mostly in the winter) in front of the computer. At any given time, I might be playing a game, or two games, while browsing reddit and listening to an audiobook. To her, I'm just not doing anything.

Somehow, she's never noticed how hard it is for me to hold a conversation. I'm always asking her to repeat herself because my mind drifts off, but she ask how she was supposed to know that I had trouble listening. 

So yeah, the self and observer reports don't come anywhere near matching, and I know I was probably harder on myself than I should have been but I'm kind of that way. I'm guessing that they won't believe me.",adhd,adhd
"Went off meds, GPA tanked, am being properly treated now. Should I try to explain this to a potential employer? (app requires transcript) I went to an internship fair and hit it off with a rep and he seemed very interested in me and actually gave me his personal email to let him know when i filled out the application so he can proceed with it. 


However, the application itself asks for an unofficial transcript and right now my GPA is only a 2.6 which is god awful and doesn't meet the minimum requirement for most internships which is at least a 3.0


I went off my medication and had done poorly in a few classes which brought down my GPA from a 3.7 that i had maintained for the first two years of college.  This semester I got on the right medication/dosage and am doing a lot better in my classes already.  I see myself getting A's and B's this semester and plan on retaking a course I got a D in this upcoming summer. 



So is it worth explaining any of this? I don't want to come off as blaming or making excuses but the med change has been an enormous help and I want to kind of justify that. The only thing saving me at this point is my experience in the field, it's considerably good in comparison to a lot of my peers. Which is another reason im thinking maybe i should just try to explain the situation because i already have that going for me.



anyone done anything like this before? thanks. ",adhd,adhd
"What is wrong with me? Do I have PTSD? Hello,  

I’m a 25 year old woman that turns 26 in exactly two weeks, and I couldn’t fathom being anymore depressed than I am now. When I was 14 and a new sophomore in high school , I met this 22 year old man (I’ll call him The Man) via my friend who was 14 as well. At the time I didn’t know how old he was and he and my friend’s sister (16) were dating. Somehow, the man got my phone number and consistently and persistently texted me until I stopped ignoring him and began texting back. 

I didn’t like him at first, but after weeks of texting nonstop, my 14 year old self somehow fell for him. I knew he was involved with my friend’s sister, and it ate me alive, but I also had feelings for him. One day, when my mom wasn’t home, I invited him over for the first time. We met at my neighborhood pool, and we sat in his car and talked in person for about an hour. When it was time for me to leave, he wrestled with me for about 10 mins trying to kiss me, and when I finally submitted, the only thing I could say was that his breath smelled. He left, and we continued to text. 

A week later, my friend’s sister (who was in my orchestra class) gave me a note basically cursing me out for “kissing her man” and calling me a fat slut, which hurt because although I’m no where near obese, I’ve always struggled with my weight, and she knew that. I crumpled the paper up and threw it at her telling her that he has been persistently pursuing me. It was a big thing and I almost got kicked out of class. I was really hurt, but I knew I was wrong. I texted him and asked him why he told her, and he said he didn’t want to keep a secret from her, and that he couldn’t see me anymore. I was extremely hurt and didn’t really understand what had happened. He began to ignore me, but would sometimes call me and leave messages about how sorry he was. This all took place around this time this year, the fall. 

I fell into a depression, being that this was my first romantic encounter, and it was so negatively toxic, I didn’t know what to think or do. I stopped eating and lost a bunch of weight. Being that I couldn’t talk to anyone about this, my family thought I had developed an eating disorder. This lasted a couple months. Then in December, around Christmas break, I started getting prank phone calls. They would call about twice a day, and after about a week, the person came clean and turns out it was The Man.  He told me that he and my friend’s sister ended things because her mom found out about their relationship. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Elated, I told him I loved him too and agreed to being in a relationship with him. 

When school started back in January, he would come over after school every Wednesday. My single mom worked a lot, and I took advantage of that. We happily “dated” for exactly a month, until one day, he told me that my friend’s sister wanted him back and wanted to work on their relationship. He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don’t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. 

He continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don’t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn’t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn’t press charges. 

About a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other’s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend’s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years’ birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I’ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must’ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don’t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn’t understand. 

About 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn’t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn’t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. 

When I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. 

The case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender’s list for 3 years. 

At the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I’m starting to believe I’m traumatized. 

 I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I’m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don’t really know what intimacy is. 

I don’t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. 

I have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I’m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. 

I feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. 

I still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it’s starting to swallow me whole. I’ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.

 I don’t know who I am anymore and I’m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I’m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don’t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. 

Im in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I’ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I’ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can’t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I’ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I’m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I’m always alone and always will be. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.",ptsd,ptsd

"To test or not to test For many years I have wondered whether I have adhd.

Let me go back and say that my mom left us when I was 16 years old and didn’t know I had PTSD from that until about two weeks ago, so a lot of my behaviors are suddenly making sense.  


I have always thrown myself at people because I’m terrified that if I don’t remind them constantly that I’m there that they will forget me.  So I text people nonstop, I am constantly asking people if they want to hang out, I am forever telling my few friends that I’m so grateful for them and I feel like I come off looking super clingy and desperate and, well, crazy. 


I am desperate to make a connection with someone because I cannot handle being alone. 


So I meet this new guy and of course I’m like “hey I’m here, I like you, I want to hang out with you, I’m available, don’t forget that I want to keep talking to you.”  I can fucking see myself doing it and I can’t stop.   If I don’t cling on, they leave.  If I do cling, they leave.  So am I just destined to be alone? Is that maybe the better option?  How can I possibly inflict myself on anyone?  I’m just so tired of being alone and I want someone to care and I want someone to want to want to spend time with me.

"Diagnosed depressed/GAD my entire life which I’ve been treated for and NOTHINGS worked. I’ve also been diagnosed ADD for which I’ve never been treated. Could the depression/GAD be related to the ADD? Thanks to anyone who can give me insight into this condition.

I’ve been depressed and anxious for 15 years which I have tried treating through every means possible. Meds, therapy, ketamine infusion, transcranial magnetic stimulation, ayahuasca, meditation, yoga, dieting, exercise, etc.

Over the years I’ve had a couple of doctors tell me that I have ADD but we could revisit treating that down the road when the anxiety is under control, which it never has been. I’ve since continued to be treated for depression and anxiety by multiple psychiatrists but nothing’s worked.

Have any of you been in similar situations and treated your ADD/ADHD n found that it actually improved your depressive and anxiety symptoms?

"“Pablo” is a kid’s show on Netflix with a main character with ASD that doesn’t treat him in a judgmental or negative manner My kids have been watching this show for awhile and I had somewhat tuned it out because it seemed like the average little kid show and I find most of them boring. 

But then I realized that all the animal characters represent Pablo’s various qualities- a bird who loves flapping, a giraffe that is really focused on rules and facts, a llama that likes repeating, a mouse that hates loud noise, an orangutan that is very energetic, and a dinosaur that worries about everything- and many of the episodes deal with explaining and showing how Pablo sees the world.

"Marijuana and need for total isolation? Hey everyone. First post on here. I am not diagnosed yet, but I have an upcoming evaluation for ASD. With all the research I've done over the past few months, a diagnosis would certainly explain \*everything\* about me. 

I am currently diagnosed with ADHD, and I am on medication. However, my personal experiences with marijuana that I'm about to explain are \*not\* caused by THC / stimulant interactions -- the experiences I have with THC have been consistent before and after stim treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ON TO MY ACTUAL POST\~\~\~\~\~\~

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to know how THC affects your mental state. From what I've read, the affects vary. No ASD is the same, so the affects won't be either.  


I personally love sativas. I feel more ""me."" It allows me to enjoy the creative thoughts and embrace my sensory-overlaps (like ""watching"" music) that I have to suppress throughout the day.  


HOWEVER. When I smoke weed, I need to be -completely- alone. The only exception is smoking with someone that is incredibly special and close to my heart. Like I won't even smoke weed during the day because even hearing birds chirping or cars driving by outside feel like a total ""intrusion"" into my world. Driving, going to a social event, or going anywhere outside (aside from a forest, or some place without people) is so far out of the realm of possibility for me.  


It's upsetting, because I watch people smoke weed together and I think ""Hooow can they do that and not feel totally alien?""  I really do love smoking... It's like it opens the door to my inner world that I so often have to keep shut. It's annoying though, because I so so so wish I could share this place with people. I wish they could see, hear, and feel this place. Like if they were actually ""here"" with me, it would be amazing... so it kinda sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

How does weed affect you? Do you feel it helps or hurts your ability to connect and be present with the ""outside"" world? Can anyone else relate to what I explained?  


\~\~\~\~\~\~also\~\~\~\~\~

&amp;#x200B;

Since I'm here, does anyone currently / has anyone taking stimulant meds before? Same overall question -- Do you feel they make you more present in the ""outside"" world? Do they make you feel calmer because you do not have to work so hard to be ""present,"" or do they make you anxious because... they're stimulants?",autism,autism
"Wife needing perspective My husband is an alcoholic. He won't say that, but it's true from my perspective. He has ruined us financially because he won't go to work, he has completely checked out of our 15 year marriage and 3 kids for a long period of time, and he is psychologically abusive (in my opinion). 

In October I had finally had enough after he told me on a Wednesday he would stop drinking and got black out drunk and pooped his pants the following Saturday. We have 3 kids. I can't live this way any longer. I told him he either had to leave or stop drinking. He chose to leave. 

He came back after a week with promises of going to AA and therapy and church, and no alcohol. I believed him. I even made him sign a contract promising to uphold it, because in the past, all the times we've had the same conversation, it didn't work. 

In the next two weeks he stayed sober. Traded his truck in, got himself a new used car, made a lot of big decisions financially (took out a large loan, when he only needed a couple of hundred dollars), and then suddenly one morning decided I was ""too quiet"", not affectionate enough, a nag, etc. etc. and he took his belongings and left again. Again!

He was only gone a day, but in that day he went to his mothers and got drunk. I asked if he was serious about his sobriety, then why would his first instinct be to drink? I try to be understanding. I know everyone has issues, we all have trauma. I know things aren't an easy straight line. But why? 

He said it's because he doesn't have a drinking problem, he's only sober to please me. 

Another month goes by. He was ok for most of it, but he never did any of the things he promised other than staying sober, but then he started getting mad at little stuff again. On a Sunday morning, he woke up, left for 4 hours, came home with his bumper popped off, and in a GREAT mood. I thought, either he's cheating or was drinking. Because he's lied about being drunk a million times. (Which he now says never happened.) He told me he didn't tell me where he was going because I was ""short"" with him, and I deserved it. He took his stuff and left again, under the guise on my unreasonable behavior. 

He went to his mothers and drank again. 

His Mom knows this problem and says she's never ""seen"" it as a problem there for she believes her loved ones when they say it's ok. Even though her brother OD'd and died from drugs that she claimed weren't a problem. 

He came home again the next day. Establishing again, that I deserved it, because I shouldn't have been mistrustful. 

Today, it's been 2 weeks. And he's gone again. Because this time I asked him to take out left overs to the trash. 

I keep begging him to help with the kids or the house, because he barely works now, and he still refuses. So this morning he started the day with, ""You're being unreasonable. We can't communicate. To build better communication skills, I think I should live at my mothers for a while.""

So I'm telling him I need him and his response is to leave. To build better communication, his solution is to do it less. And to build trust in the perspective of alcoholism, he needs to go live where he's had some of his worst moments? 

I think he's finding some way to turn me into a bad person so he can justify (to himself) that he should leave and in turn, drink. All the times he leaves, the first thing he does is drink. 

He blames me for everything in his life, down to once he tripped at work, and he told me it was my fault he tripped because I took up to much of his time thinking. If it weren't for ME he wouldn't have tripped. 

I feel like he is turning that same perspective into finding faults so he can find excuses to leave, and then drink. He is completely all over the place. Him saying he couldn't live with me and needed to leave, an hour later after me literally sobbing and saying ""If you'll just tell me how to talk to you I will"" because he says I'm \*too loud, then I try and talk calmly and I'm \*condescending, which then I try and \*email which he ignores, and then I \*text and he won't respond. So I'm out of ideas. I'm out of hope. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is never going to stop, is it? And am I at all justified in thinking all his issues with leaving me FOUR times in 2 months stems from him finding ways to fault me so he can go drink? Because he says that's insane. Even though that's exactly what he does. 

I never knew he had so much anger or hostility toward me, nor thought I was such a bad wife, until I gave him the ultimatum in October. And he has made my life hell ever since. And I feel so incredibly stupid because I keep thinking it'll stop or get better, and it just keeps repeating that same sick cycle. ",alcoholism,alcoholism

I'm making this post because I've hit a **massive wall in my life.** I dropped out of college and community college, and my brain won't seem to let me focus on jobs any more. I held one job for nearly two years before my brain crashed and I ended up leaving. Now I have trouble even getting started in the job process. I'll show up for an interview, maybe the first day of orientation, then I'll immediately lose interest and flat out either quit or not show up. 

Growing up, two things always stayed constant, my love for video games and my love for books. I could sit with a book all day and finish it on the day I borrowed it from the library. I could play a game for hours on end if left unattended. These days, I have a tough time even starting a book and I seem to have replaced books with the internet. 

As for video games, I have a huge backlog of games that I have collected and lost interest in and I seem to only be able to focus on fast paced games (Overwatch, Uncharted, Tomb Raider) or purely story based games (Telltale Games, Life is Strange) and I get bored of games with a lot of freedom easily. (Horizon Zero Dawn, Dark Souls 3, The Witcher 3). I don't know if that's relevant or not.

"Accepting the fact that I have a problem. Now what? Hi Everybody,   


First time posting here. I have started to accept that I have a drinking problem and I need to stop. I've been really struggling with finances and I realized that my drinking habit (going out, cocktails, craft beer, was literally taking almost half of my pay check). I tried to do a sober January and made it just 13 days, and fell right back into my old routine of drinking daily (usually at least three).   


I've noticed I'm much more motivated by booze than my friends. Can't go skiing with out Apres, can't go mountain biking with out beers in the parking lot. If we go out with friends, I need atleast three drinks, whether it is dinner or if it is to party. While it hasn't creeped into impacting my professional life. I can tell my relationship with Alcohol is trending in a negative direction. Right now, I'm struggling with my finances and when I check my bank account almost 50 percent of my pay check goes to booze/going out. I don't have money for paying off my credit card or starting a savings, but I do always have money to spend 50 dollars on fancy cocktails. I'm not keeping up my half of the home expenses and it's negatively impacting my relationship.   


I recently read this artcle about the famous Montreal restauranteur, David McMillan who owns Joe Beef and gave up drinking. It really resonated.  [https://www.bonappetit.com/story/david-mcmillan-sober](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/david-mcmillan-sober) Particularly his opening line: ""I was never falling-down drunk. I was never belligerent. I always got my work done. I was never unkempt. I was always clean, I was always shaved, I always performed at work. I was always kind and gracious in the dining room. But I lived in hell.""  


It made me realize that alcohol abuse comes in many forms, and that I definitely do not have a healthy relationship with it. So I am hear to say that I have a drinking problem and I want to stop, but am looking for guidance on how?   


One realization I have had is that much of my life is built around booze. My girlfriend and love to explore new restaurants and breweries, we have our favorite wine bar that we go to for date nights, our favorite pub that we go to for comfort food, drinking while we cook dinner at home is a common occurrence. When we travel to a new city, our favorite thing to do is explore the local joints, eating and drinking our way around the city. It's a big part of our relationship.   


Additionally much of my life outside of work involves drinking, even the mountain bike advocacy group I am a part of has a beer sponsor, our trail nights end in beers at the trail head, our meetings are held at the up stairs of a local bar. Drinking is just part of what we do.   


I'm looking for advice on ways to quit, specifically:   


1. For me I feel like the easiest solution would be to remove my self from situations that involve booze, until I am sober. But the reality is that I can't do it. It would remove me from my partner, remove me from my friends and remove me from organizations and social settings that are all positives in my life. 
2. Are there good online resources and community that I can use? Where can I start? I'm not really a person for support groups and have found online communities to be a huge help with other issues. 
3. What has worked for you? Specifically to get through that first 30 days?

But the problem is the voice doesn’t t like that and it has become more active than when I wasn’t using meds. I’m afraid I’ll never recover because the doctor said since I’ve had psychosis for over 6 months it’s possibly schizophrenia. I’ve actually had full on symptoms since February 2018 but after I was discharged from the hospital I smoked weed again like 3 times Because I thought I’ll be good but each time the voice became clearer. Usually my only symptom is that I hear the voice and I see things and recently I’ve been having a lot of sex visions cause I’ve been watching a lot of porn to fill the sexual void in my life but back to my recovery, the voice keeps commenting on my porn watching and then tonight it told me that it’ll be with me forever.(I really feel like it’s the devil due to my experiences in the hospital &amp; my school residence)I really don’t want that to be true &amp; I told my doctor that if it doesn’t go after a few years I’ll probably kill myself.

"Advice on Meeting Potential Romantic Partner Hi all, great sub, appreciate as many perspectives on this question as possible.  I’m speaking with my sponsor and other trusted mentors in my fellowship, but the more opinions the better!

I’ve been sober now for just under 20 months.  I’ve got a solid program, sponsor calls daily, average of 1-2 meetings a day.  I’m starting a new career tomorrow.  Grateful for where I am, and very watchful of losing it through slowing down or stopping the things that got me here.

I didn’t date or do much of anything during my active alcoholism.  Even before that, relationships were fairly rare.  But it’s something I want in life: eventually marriage and a family.  I’m not in a great hurry, and like I said, keeping my sponsor in the loop.

I have heard nightmare stories about harassment and even abuse within the fellowship for years: men preying on female newcomers, or harassing female members into avoiding certain meetings.  I would NEVER want to this, even inadvertently; I’d also hate to even be mistakenly seen to be acting like that.  Just as importantly, I would never want to do or say anything that could make a woman feel uncomfortable coming to a meeting.

Along with the above, I don’t want to do anything that may hurt my own sobriety.  Relationships between addicts can go good or bad , just like any other.

So...aside from work, most of my free time is spent in the rooms, and at church functions.  Naturally, I managed to join the parish in town with an average parishioner age of 65, so there’s not anything going on there.  

To the point: there’s a woman that I see at a few meetings a week.  We’ve talked casually before and after meetings, she’s definitely someone I’m interested in.  Beautiful, very sweet and hilarious, great personality.  She’s also got 5 years sober, and I know her sponsor, who is a “wise sage” around here.  In short...I don’t know what the fuck to do!

My sponsor seems satisfied that I’m in a good place, and he’s not opposed to in-fellowship relationships out of hand.  But, in light of everything above, just not sure how to proceed.

Any personal experiences or opinions are really appreciated.  Thanks!",alcoholism,alcoholism

"I never thought I had PTSD, but after the symptoms I’m pretty sure that I do. Hi everyone,

I feel like I should give a little background. About 7-8 months ago I left my abusive ex-girlfriend, she was my first serious partner and we were together for about a year and a half. She pretty much ruined my life, and I experienced all kinds of abuse while I was with her (and even when we were apart), including emotional, mental and physical. 

Fast forward to today, I have a new relationship with the sweetest girl in the world, a brand new start since I’m a freshman in college, and there’s a good chance that I will never have to speak with or maybe even see my ex for a good while. 

But there are some things that remind me of her that if I see or hear them my body tends to freeze and my heart starts to beat rapidly. Sometimes I’ll even sweat or feel like I’m having a panic attack. Usually it’s whenever I see somebody that physically resembles her or hear a cough (she got sick often and had a distinctive cough) that sounds like hers. 

The thought popped into my head that maybe this is a serious issue, and so I looked a little bit at some of the symptoms and it definitely seems possible that I have a mild case of PTSD. I’m not sure if this makes a difference, but my mom also had it for a while when my dad died, so I’m not sure if that has any effect on me or not. 

I was just wondering if anybody out there could confirm or deny that this is PTSD, even with the pretty limited information I’ve provided. Even though it’s not really serious, I would still like to know. 

Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask questions if you have any!

"Mom (65) is an alcoholic. Stepdad is avoiding the problem. My mom was a wonderful parent when is was young. My friends used to comment on how cool she was. She talked to us like we were people, she listened and I idolized her. 

Now she’s lonely, my step dad works too much, and she keeps trying to fill her life with animals and alcohol. 

She’s probably depressed, and has had some episodes of just crying for a whole day. After calling me on such a day some weeks ago I got her an appointment with a psycologist, she went, twice, and now she’s «happy» and doesn’t need the therapist any more. 

She works, and does her job well, but I’m quite sure that she drinks as soon as she gets inside at the end of the day. 

She never drives when my stepdad and her go to their cabin, probably because she’s drunk. 

Some years ago I thought she was showing signs of dementia, she kept repeating questions and forgetting appointments, but it turns out she was just drunk.

I have talked to her a couple of times, I’ve been kind and empathetic, but yesterday I lost it.

My brother went there to have dinner, she was clearly not sober, and he was sad about it. I sent me a message and told me and I got angry and sent her a long message about what I think of her drinking, and that I’ve had enough. Apparently she said something along «what the fuck does she know» and my brother ended up leaving, came to mye house and got dinner here instead. 

I sent a message to my stepdad appologizing for making a mess of their evening, but also told him this is my moms problem, but it’s affecting us and our relationship with her and I’m done pretending.

Also sent a message to my aunt, my moms sister, so she knew my version in case my mom was going to call her.

I’m not sure what to do now. I’m supposed to take my mom to a concert on wednesday, but I’m not sure right now. I love my mom, but I don’t like her at the moment.

TL;DR: Mom has become an alcoholic the last few years. Yesterday she got mad at my brother for telling me she was drunk, because I sent an angry message to her telling her to get her shit together.

"PTSD sucks [TW] I know I’m preaching to the choir here. But it really does.

How can I make it better? I need better strategies for overcoming this. It’s taking up so much of my time and thoughts. 

I just want to feel like myself, to feel like I can move forward and leave it behind. 

I’ve spent all weekend barely able to get out of bed, having really bad flashbacks and when I eventually get some sleep, nightmares.

I’ve got a counsellor, which is great, but she keeps cancelling our sessions. She’s cancelled 5weeks out of 9, so it’s all a bit sporadic.

I’m trying so hard. To keep going. To go to uni, keep on top of my work. To look after my family. To be a good friend and girlfriend. 

But sometimes it feels inescapable. 

Recently I keep wanting to take Codeine,  just because it feels nice for a bit. I’ve only done it a few times and I’ve never taken too many. But that’s not the point. I shouldn’t need to be doing it at all.

I’m worried as well that I keep getting suicidal. And when I do it seems so rational. I don’t want to end up doing something stupid on the spur of the moment just because it seems like a good idea. 

When it passes I’m always so glad I didn’t do anything.

But I also never tell anyone when I get like that. I don’t want them to worry about me. Or think I’m being over dramatic or saying it for attention.

My ex used to use suicide threats as a way to control me. I never want to make anyone feel like that.

"Poem: Alone I am. Alone I am, sitting at the lunch table 
Hearing laughter from far away 
Wondering whether today or not 
I would be cherished and embraced 

Alone I am, in the classroom 
always chosen as last partner 
the dirty looks focus on someone 
And that someone is me. 

Alone I am, on the playground 
wanting to make friends 
The heartless one comes up to me 
And says I would be better off dead

Alone I am, in the hallways 
Friendless and in Pain 
the others stare and smile 
but none have ever say hello 

Alone I am, in this world. 
different and frowned upon 
Never understanding their rules 
And they never understand me. 

Alone I am, on the spectrum 
Thinking in my domain 
Where It is safe and free 
For that is how the world should be 



This poem was written by me, BonelessAngelBoy, in reflection on Autism Acceptance Month.  I am on the spectrum and I wrote this to express my feelings about my middle school years.

"Why do pharmacies struggle to get ADHD meds? We are in the U.K. and I thought it was to do with the fact that fewer people medicate and adhd isn’t as accepted here. However, I think lots of you are in the USA and you seem to have more trouble. Insurers not filling scripts, pharmacies refusing to carry stock or refill. 

Why is this seen as acceptable? I had pharmacies mess us about - big names, not independents. My kid used to get two months supplied as it had got difficulty to find a pharmacy and get them on time. I used to get so stressed. Without them he risked exclusion from school. They aren’t a choice if he needs to be in school! The pharmacist said he disapproved of that and called the doctors to stop them doing it. I’m middle aged, boring, sensible and really don’t come across like a dealer. I’ve got all the medical letters and diagnostic proof for my child but still we get treated with suspicion and, I did feel, disapproval. 

One day I tried a different pharmacy. They were a run down looking independent. They have been amazing. Not only will they always ensure they have it in stock, they are knowledgeable, kind and friendly. I can phone them from the appointment if there is a medication change. They put it on fast order so I can get the meds later that day. Other pharmacies wouldn’t do that. They would insist on seeing the script, take 48hrs and were so unfriendly. I never go anywhere else now. They ask about him with compassion and interest. We chat and I can ask for information and help about medication from them. 

Why is it seen as acceptable to treat those who need these medications so badly? No other pharmacy would keep them in stock. They all acted as though I was asking them to get a months supply of crystal meth. Why, in the USA, where medication is common, do you have so much trouble getting your meds? How is that acceptable? Do they treat other neurological disorders like this?

However, my parents say that I ""scare them sometimes"" even though the only thing I can really say I'm bad at is adapting quivk enough. When I'm driving through areas I'm familiar with, I'm very attentive because I know what to look for.

"" experiencing life intellectually, not emotionally ""

That is bang on how I feel.  I don't feel like I am actively avoiding anything, well except with how I use alcohol to take the edge off and make sex with my husband happen, I mostly feel like I am just shut off.

"Please Help! Behavior is out of control. I have an almost 8 yo son with ASD. He has also been diagnosed with ADHD, SPD, ODD, and OCD (all the other diagnoses were made before the final diagnosis of ASD, I realize they all fall under that umbrella. 

We (his dad and I) are in the process of making some diet changes. That isn’t something we can do over night. We are reading and researching right now. 

We are also in the process of finding him a therapist. 

I am looking for any ideas, suggestions, books, strategies, etc. for helping his behavior. He didn’t want to go to school this morning and basically punched and kicked his dad all morning. We don’t spank or hit in our house. If he doesn’t want to do something, there is no reward or punishment that will encourage him to make a better or right decision. Instead of saying “No, I don’t want to take goldfish today, can I take X instead?” (Which would be fine), he screams and kicks and throws a huge fit. His dad got out a snack to help him finish packing his lunch, we don’t care what snack he takes, but if he won’t pick one then we need to get one for him. This type of thing happens frequently. Even after being told he can make his own choice, he won’t make it and then melts down when we make it for him. 

On top of this, he really struggles expressing his emotions. Sometimes I know what’s wrong and sometimes I don’t. When I do know, it’s easier to help him. I know he doesn’t want to shower when I ask because he’d rather play on his tablet. If I tell him he can have 5 more minutes before he showers, he’s often good with a compromise like that. But even getting him to tell me, “I don’t want to take a shower because I want to play” is so hard. I will ask him prompting questions like “Are you upset? Why?” And he still can’t answer. It’s much more difficult when I don’t know the answer.

I didn't know whether I would be dismissed by being told I'm overthinking, not understood, grilled relentlessly or if I'd be given an indication of whether I was finally on the right path to finding out why I felt the way I did.

I met with a man, Tom, at my local disability services health clinic. During the appointment he was asking me many questions about how I felt,giving me scenarios and asking what I would do/think and feel in those situations. He was very mindful of not pushing too hard, letting me ramble but keeping me on track whilst constantly scribbling down notes and giving me smiles of reassurance.

Then he did a questionnaire/ test with me. He said the average score was 16.2, 80% of people that score 30 or higher are diagnosed with Autism. I scored 42.

He told me not to be worried, that this was a positive thing and not negative, he said he cannot officially tell me I have Autism from this test but that he is putting me on the waiting list for a full diagnosis test, the wait is 18 months. 

He was very kind, I had been there an hour and a half, I was drained, sweating, shaking and had a headache. He told me that if I needed him I can text him. He told me if I am struggling with college or work that he can come and speak to them so that I can get help and any special adjustments.
I have never felt more listened to or understood by someone in person before. 

Now I don't know where to go from here, I have 18 months to wait until I can go for my full diagnosis but I feel more sure that I am going down the right path and that I do infact has Autism but I still feel stuck in limbo.

"I love this sub and feel like family here (even though I’m a lurker). So I hope it’s okay if I use my first post to vent... Hey y’all. 

First of all, this sub is my fuckin safe haven. I’ve learned so much from all of you and coming here makes me feel a little less alone, so thanks for all you do.

Background: F(23), diagnosed a few months ago with inattentive type by my CB therapist after spending five years attempting to pinpoint the origin/triggers of my anxiety and depression, and I’m a senior in college.

You guys, I want to fucking give up. Not in life, but I want to drop out of school. I’ve spent three years in community college, then transferred to a 4 year. Despite loans and grants (was never nearly enough motivated to get a scholarship), I’ve racked up about 20k in debt, still accruing. I have constantly changed my mind about my area of study (Went from Brit lit to Polisci to criminology to sociology &amp; gender studies and wish I could still switch to Environmental studies but it’s too late for that). I am incredibly passionate about certain things that I study; I live in STL and was at the protests in Ferguson, which opened my eyes to the causes I want to fight for. I want to become a community organizer to aid the fight in my city for social justice or do research for a Southern Poverty Law Center or anything to just make the world a better place.  I just do not give one single fuck about school.
High school was such a fuckin breeze, man. CC was similar, but was starting to slack somewhat but was able to keep my head above water.  At university, shit got real. I just stopped going to class and turning in assignments. I didn’t even freak out before tests that I hadn’t studied AT ALL because I just Did Not Care anymore. 

I thought this semester was going to be different, with my official diagnosis and a more positive outlook. It started that way for sure, but now I’m deeper than I ever have been. I’m weeks behind and every time I tell myself “Alright, time to buckle down!” I just COMPLETELY shut down. It’s almost as if I black out/go on auto pilot. I just.....don’t care. It’s even worse now for a couple reasons; 1. It’s my last year so senioritis and harder assignments and 2. I have professors that I actually really fuckin respect and look up to and genuinely ENJOY the class and when I actually put in the work (rate), I’ve been told that I’m capable of great things. Most of all, that I’m an incredible writer and critical thinker. So these professors that are trying to reach out and encourage me...I feel like I’m fuckin failing them and EMBARRASSING myself. That’s it, more than anything. I know what I COULD be capable of. I’m extremely passionate, have leadership skills, and I’m fuckin smart. I know I am. But I’m just throwing it all away.

I want an education. I want my bachelors. Fuck, I want my PhD and maybe become a professor or a great mind in my field and fuckin help people like I know I was born to do. But the symptoms of my ADD cause me to be this lazy piece of shit with no consideration for the long-term consequences of my actions. 

I’m just discouraged, to what seems to be beyond all help. I’m terrified that I’ll end up living a life that I am ashamed of by not living up to my full potential. 

I don’t know, you guys. It just blows. Just glad I have a place like this to express the way I feel. Thanks.

I materialize into a creature that has an insatiable hunger...for booze! And after each night of total debauchery, I wake up (naked), just like a werewolf, feeling banged up from who knows what, with the taste of things I should not have consumed on my lips. I have forgotten myself and had no control of the mischief and the damages that I have done. So alas, when one figures out the origin of their condition, it’s time to stop.

"Any way to help my mom get the help she needs? I posted on r/relationship_advice but figured I could post here as well, maybe getting more answers to this unfortunate question.

I'm 15 and have been dealing with my parents alcoholism with my 9yo brother for about a year or so now (though apparently its been going on for 10+ years) My dad has seen what it's been doing to our family and has decided to/has quit (I haven't seen him drunk in a while now)

My mom on the other hand seems to be guiltless. No matter what we say or do she refuses to talk to us about it when shes sober, and yells and locks herself in her room/passes out when shes drunk. She'll start to drink the moment she wakes up some days, drinking all throughout the day no matter what happens. I've had to cancel plans with friends too many times because of this. Occasionally she'll drink while she works from home too. I'm tired of throwing this under the rug. The moment shes finally sober, we all act like nothing ever happened and I'm sick of it.

Don't get me wrong, I understand that she's been through a hell of a lot, and because of recent personal events, old feelings have resurfaced. I painfully understand that if she doesn't want help, then she won't get it. There's no arguing with an addict. But enough is enough.

I'm tired and sad and I want to go to sleep without wondering which mother I'm going to wake up to; wondering if today is finally the day that the empty promises of the night before might be full, real, true promises. That I might be able to hear 'I love you' without thinking of it as an apology and an excuse. I want to be able to cry again. I want this numbness to go away.

I used to talk to my friends about this (not super comfortable talking about this kind of thing with my dad, and obviously not my mom) but due to unfortunate events that involved my mom getting drunk in front of my friends, I cant do that anymore without feeling immense guilt and sorrow. It's been six months since then, and they have no idea that she continues to drink. I can't get in contact with my therapist any time soon. I feel empty and numb and so alone. I want to be able to walk out of my room and socialize with my own family without my anxiety clinging to me.

Is there any way that we can get through to her? We are desperate at this point and I want to be free of this burden. I don't want my brother growing up thinking that this is what a family is, that this is *okay.* It's probably already too late for that.

"It's consuming my dad and affecting my parents marriage Hi everyone. First time here and I'm not sure where to begin. 

My dad's always been a heavy drinker and now it's becoming a theme where he overdrinks, starts to throw up and misses work because of it. My mother isn't working because of a recent surgery and I'm currently doing what I can to find a full time job after school. 

I've said stuff before, I've cleaned up his cans, but in the end I realize I might not have much power here. My grandma confronted me about it today concerned and pretty much emplored me to fix it else my parents marriage is at stake as currently they aren't talking right now so I'm the only one helping my mom post-op.

Basically, my(20) boyfriend(23) of a little over a year has drinking problems. He's well aware of them, and is working to control them. His father is an alcoholic so he knows he's more prone to it. I'm very proud of him for how he's improved since I first met him but lately the past 2 months he's been relapsing badly,  And I honestly can't stand him when he's drunk.

And I'll admit we fight a lot when he's drunk. Never like, abuse or anything, just arguing a lot. He yells and hits things and it scares the shit out of me. I know I need to be more patience and understanding, however it's been really draining on my own mental health. I've been trying to encourage him to reach out to some type of addiction treatment since there's some things I just can't help with. However he doesn't want to do anything like that.

Is there anything else I can do? I don't mean to sound selfish as I know this is harder for him than for me, but I'm really exhausted at this point. I really love him and I want him to get better.",alcoholism,alcoholism

"Need some autism tests. This post might be offend someone and if it does, I apologise, this post is not meant to be hurtful or disrespectful in anyways, but merely a way of understanding.   I will first give you the background, the symptoms that I have found the background evidence of myself (example if I display these traits) and any other business.  

This is to get a good representation of if I have traits of autism.  I will attempt to be as unbiased as I possibly can and provide references as needed. 

The two sources of traits that I will be comparing myself to is:

\-  [https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/asd.aspx](https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/asd.aspx) 

\-  [http://autismni.org/characteristics-of-autism.html](http://autismni.org/characteristics-of-autism.html)   
There are other sources around, but I picked two sites at random.

&amp;#x200B;

Note:  I am aware that the term autism is a spectrum and that everyone, in some degree is within that spectrum, but some are more in that spectrum that others.  I will attempt to help people understand as best as I am able to, if you feel that I have not given the correct message over, please tell me and I will try to re-write it so may better understand.

I am an adult and I have been initially diagnosed with bipolar.  While that might be true, I don't think it is and would like advice from those that have exposure to it and see it we marry up with traits.

Final, final, I am not saying I am, I am not saying I am not autistic.  I am thinking that there is more to it (such as nurturing, background, social interaction, environmental exposure, etc) that might fill in the voids that people consider part of the autistic traits.  That is a theory at the moment, and one that I have not proven.  Mainly because I have investigated yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The things I know I do that are highly probable in autistic people:

\- I love being alone.

\- I have no filter in what and how I say it.

\- I love routine and order in my life. 

\- I don't understand jokes.

\- I am very literal in what I and other people say.

\- I want to be on my own.

\- I have always acted and felt different to other kids.  I haven't every really fitted in anywhere really.

\- I sometimes become highly focused.  To a point where that's all I obsessively think about.

\- I am not empathetic or sympathetic

\- I can relate to women younger than me and men much older than myself.  Not in a sexual way, but it's what I find a more natural rapport happens.

\- I hate being touched.

\- I struggle maintaining friendships/relationships.

\- I hate loud noises.

\- There are some textures/fibers that I can't touch.  Example nylon and the fur on a peach.

\- Hate loud noises.  It's kinda messes with me?  Where I can't really do that much after and I require at least two days in quiet to reset my brain.

To counter this argument, you could argue that some were the direct result of a lack of nurturing.  Example, parents never touched a child, bad childhood experiences, just how someone is born.  There are many deviance's and reasons to why someone is like they are.  Again, This is how I am understanding it, but if I am incorrect then it's nice to have a different view on things.

It's not just this, I struggle with things that other people take for granted: the ability to know when you're in danger, I don't understand particular circumstances, such as the world is confusing to me.  eg - why can't buildings be exactly the same? why as things so crooked and uneven (such as uneven paths.) I can't give maybe examples left, right and center, but he above is a good example.

Because of that, I think slow, it takes me ages to grasp new concepts, or, sometimes I don't get sentences or how people word or say something, and that's the most frustrating thing.  I see people just get and understand things and I am kinda here left on my own to do my own things, which is nice, but on another scale isn't.

"Caregiver help? As of 6 days ago, my schizophrenic sister lives with me. The other option (after being released from her umpteenth psychiatric stay) was homelessness (again). She can’t live with my parents because they (stepdad specifically) are major triggers for her aggressions.

She suffers from many religious delusions and hallucinations that I won’t get into because it would be too long and difficult to explain.  Most of the time these delusions are scary, to say the least.  The voices she hears have a control over her that makes her very angry.

"Quitting Therapy Hi everyone,

I recently started graduate school, and I also began therapy again since counseling services are available through my University. I’ve had 6 sessions so far. 

I think therapy is making everything a million times worse. My therapist has been really determined to point out my defense mechanisms (making jokes, and intellectualizing). This also makes me angry because I don’t think there’s anything wrong with those, but my therapist disagrees. When this happens, I fall into a psychological spiral- I come home, curl up in a ball, and cry the whole night. I barely sleep. I also can’t get up in the mornings, and it’s harming my productivity in graduate school, which further contributes to my anxiety. The stress also makes me feel nauseous most of the time. For the last 3 days, I’ve been in overwhelming pain- basically constant crying and nausea. 

When I bring this up, my therapist always turns it around and rephrases it as a question: “How can we balance treatment so that you’re not overwhelmed but we’re still making progress?”
I never have an answer for him when he does this, and so we just change topics and everything gets worse. 

I also don’t jive well with my therapist, but I can’t say why. I just feel kind of uncomfortable around them. 

I’m thinking about quitting therapy, but the thought is causing me to panic. At this point, I don’t know if it’s really helping anymore. And I’m panicking because I’ve been so non-functional that I seriously cannot afford to have another week like this week. I’m worried something really bad will happen if I do.

I’m a 27 year old who had a traumatic experience about two months ago. I went to an exercise class and stopped in the middle (short of breath). I proceeded to convinced myself I was having a heart attack... when it was really just a panic attack. I tried to stay calm, but I was alone and totally gave in to my freak out. To make things worse, this all happened during the Pride parade in NYC. The only thing I could think about that entire time was “how am I gonna get home alone in this... I’m just gonna die here.” I proceeded to stay in a corner of the gym lobby for four hours till friends came to get me. I was really shaken up but convinced myself I’d feel better in the morning. The next morning I could even leave my house. I’m better now. I can pretty much do everything I normally do. But I go through these shitty moments where I disassociate and get anxious for no reason. I fixate on weird stuff and I just obsess with the idea that I’m one more freak out from being in a straight jacket for the rest of my life.

However he gained some weight and started intermittent fasting. Which, great, whatever. But he's become one of those guys who thinks this put him on a higher plane of existence or something.


He was driving home today and I called to ask him to buy some potato chips. He did and when he came home, I took the chips and started snacking on them while reading a book. And THEN. He started to talk about how that's an addiction just like his smoking is. That he used to snack while doing things and managed to stop and now he doesn't ever feel a need to do it. That it's a problem.


I was so shocked by this I didn't even know what to say. I asked him when exactly I hired him as my lifecoach and nutritionist. He was all nooo it was just some advice. Buddy...

"Adderal and Sociability I've been on Adderall since i was 15 and am now 24. I never struggled making/keeping friends when I was in high school but since then I have noticed how bad I really am at social interactions and talking to people.

I kind of just attributed it to some traumatic things I've been through in recent years/being away at college in a new environment. About a year ago my friend who does not have ADHD had been taking adderall to study for exams and made a comment about how hard eye contact was for her and then I began to realize how much I truly struggle making/holding eye contact with people.

It feels like when I take my medicine I'm so focused on getting things done/ being productive that I just have no interest in other people but if I don't take my medicine it is a lot easier for me to continue a conversation (still hard for me to start them though). My boyfriend can always tell when I don't take my medication because I'm much more talkative and not as irritable in our interactions. I just enjoy being social more without it.

I feel like I'm in a limbo because I have tried to stop taking my medicine for a while because I want friends and I want my coworkers to enjoy talking to me but then I have such a hard time getting my work done, being present in my interactions with my patients, and meeting all of my deadlines at work. 

I have an important interview next week and I can't decide if I want to take my medication or not. I'm worried if I do, I will come off as anxious and quiet and that won't look great for the position I'm applying for. If I don't take my medication, I'm worried I will have a hard time answering exactly what they are asking and remembering what was discussed. 

I'm kind of just ranting at this point but I'm curious to know if anyone else's social life suffers due to their medication and how they combat it.",adhd,adhd
"Regaining control I have cPTSD as well as Bipolar disorder.  

Some major circumstances changed in my life recently and destabilized me.  I'm trying to regain balance.

Initially I thought maybe I was entering a mixed or depressive episode.  That doesn't seem to be the case.  

The more I think about the various aspects of the situation, the more I see clear echos of past traumas that might be unconciouslly unbalancing me.  (For example, I was suddenly and unexpectedly pulled away from everyone I am comfortable with at work and re-assigned to a new division,  and a superior is on the one hand offering preferrential treatment if I neglect my job and do some unethical things for them, and on the other implicitly threatening poor treatment if I refuse and just do my job.)

The situation is just inherently stressful, so it may not be purely a PTSD thing, but it feels like it.  I'm in frantic fight mode, constantly attacking everyone around me for almost no reason.  I can't calm down or feel safe.   I don't feel like I can trust most of the people I deal with.  I'm extra paranoid.

I'm working on addressing the root situation, but things are moving slowly and it's a bit hard to stay sane in the meantime.

Any tips?  I've been doing a few things:

* Channeling my energy into making myself safe 
* Trying to force myself to take at least an  hour a day to do something distracting that takes my mind off things
* Trying to force myself to eat, shower, sleep and all that good stuff no matter what's going on
* Therapy
* Venting to a co-worker (probably in an inappropriate way)",ptsd,ptsd
"Questions about self-pay (USA) Good Evening,

I'm undiagnosed, but after some research and reading through you guys' posts I'm about 95% sure I have ADHD. I'm self-employed and in that beautiful gray area where Obamacare doesn't do enough for me, but I don't make enough to do for myself.

"Looking for some extra information on Multiple Complex Developmental Disorder (MCDD) I’ve taken a great interest in this disorder, but I am very dissapointed in the lack of information on it. Here are some questions I have in mind, that I am posting here in hopes someone that knows more than the average person who just had a look on Google


1. Can you get officially diagnosed with MCDD? Or is it still in some sort of research phase where there isn’t enough information gathered on it for official diagnoses?




2. How “high-functioning” would someone with this disorder be? Could you go past your childhood undiagnosed, or does it affect the sufferer so much to the point where it would be impossible for it to go under the radar?

"Advice and resources from the sub saved my business school application. I stumbled onto this sub a few months ago, about a year after my diagnosis. Even with medication, I'd been really struggling with managing my symptoms, and my psychiatrist's suggestions weren't really improving anything. While I was lurking, I came across a suggestion to record things I needed to do on an app with timed reminders—so that when the time came to get them done, I'd know. Last night, I got a notification that I had a writing proficiency exam early this morning, an exam I'd completely forgotten about. If I missed it, I'd have to wait another year to apply to business school. Thanks to the advice of this sub, I made it to the test, felt like I crushed it, and am on track to achieving my goals.

"Recently started dating someone who has an autistic child-- seeking advice for sexual deviance. Hello, I'm new to the world of Autism. Please forgive me if I don't use the proper terminology. I am seeking advice because the nine year old child has displayed patterns of sexual deviant behavior. The mother (my partner) is struggling and I'm finding it difficult to provide support because I'm uneducated when it comes to the subject matter of fetishes and sexual deviance as it pertains to a child with autism.  


A few years ago, he (7 yrs old) started acting out sexually towards a younger member of the extended family. She (5 yrs old) woke up to find her foot pressed inside his underwear against his penis. When he was younger he began displaying signs of a foot fetish and would rub his head against women's naked feet. The mother didn't really recognize the signs at first, he was four, and mostly non-verbal. As he progressed in age, his sexual behavior expanded to watching torture porn as well as foot fetish videos.  


The mother: took him to therapy (the younger girl attended separately as well) as this greatly impacted the family dynamic. For awhile, the therapy seemed to help the compulsion. However, recently when searching through his phone history the torture porn has returned. When confronted with this new information, he began to hit himself, as an attempt ""to discipline himself.""  


I'm so far out of my depth here, I feel for this child who knows what he is doing is wrong but doesn't possess the cognitive awareness to stop the urges or compulsion. The younger girl has also been affected. I feel terrible that she has been impacted and now struggles with her own personal safety because she was stripped of her innocence.   


I love this woman and I love her child, but I want to make sure this pattern of behavior doesn't continue to happen. I don't want another girl to be a victim.  I'm afraid he will grow up and start acting upon this behavior more aggressively. What can I do to provide support?

We are interested primarily in the representation of the voices/themes in the poetry, rather than the identity of the writer. The [Tom Howard/Margaret Reid Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/tom-howard-margaret-reid-poetry-contest) we are running right now offers two first prizes of $2,000 each. Ten honorable mentions will receive $100 each, and the top twelve entries will all be published on our site. The contest is international and the deadline is September 30. I’m posting here specifically because our long term goal is to change the composition of our entry pool to include more entries featuring diverse characters and themes. These voices need to be heard, and we are actively reaching out to find them. 

Sometimes when I post, there are some replies worried about a scam, so in order to head that off I just want to say that our competitions are listed by The Write Life as some of the [top writing competitions](https://thewritelife.com/writing-contests/) out there, and we’re in Writer’s Digest’s [top eight](https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/top-websites-for-writers-best-publishing-marketing-resources) sites for writers.

"Do I deserve death? Hi.

I'm going to delete this soon after, I don't want my friends to find this post. 

I'm a sixteen year old rape victim. It happened two years ago. At least, thats what people tell me.

I have been diagnosed with PTSD, have gone through medical professional after medical professional, and I've not felt better. I haven't reached a conclusion, not even gotten further towards fixing anything.

I feel like saying the words ""I am a rape victim"" is just a blatant lie for me. It surely isn't what happened. A fourteen year old and a, what, 23 year old man? But I felt okay when it happened. I could've stopped it, I had months to. I knew it would happen. 

I kept talking to him for months after. He eventually stopped giving me attention. I just needed him to notice me, but he just wouldn't anymore. He had gotten what he wanted, I guess. It made me realize what had happened. But before I could realize, I did something horrible.

He showed me things that I wish on no one. Sexual atrocities, children abuse under the guise of 'If its there, why not watch it' and 'its not hurting anyone'. A site that surely hosted images of me because of him, thinking back on it. 

I soon stopped contact with him. I once tried to contact him again for the purpose of gaining evidence, but it failed and I haven't tried since. Its useless. 

I am a firm believer that sexual abusers need to die. I don't care about morals, I don't care about ethics, I do not care for the beauty of life. This is an exception to those. 

Because I viewed that site, those images of people that were in my situation, people my age, I think I need to die. I actually, really need to die. I'm completely and utterly worthless. Its the truth, the blatant utter truth. 

But if I could get redemption, if I could actually talk about this to someone without getting in trouble, without being judged, but with truth, I think it would fix something. I hope. 

Whats worse is every month or so, I have this freak hypersexuality that genuinely discomforts me, and often triggers flashbacks, and it reminds me of it. I haven't found anything about why that happens and its embarrassing to talk about. 

Sorry this is all over the place. And ban me if you need to, or feel free to tell me that I *do* deserve death, if thats what you think. I just need others opinions, since I can't trust myself.",ptsd,ptsd
"i think my dad is an alcoholic? help please okay so. 
my dad used to have issues with drinking. when he does, he doesnt know when to stop and gets really fucked up

he quit when i was around 5, i think because of an incident where he was alone with me and my mom was working, i woke up wondering where he was and found red wine spilled all over the house, and him passed out in front of the computer. being a kid i thought it was blood and that he was murdered. i tried waking him but he was passed out. i cried for something that felt like hours going back and forth and not knowing what to do because i didnt know how to use a phone.
after a while he woke up, and broke the wine glass spilling even more red wine. then we just went to bed like normal.
i remember waking up the morning after and cleaning it all up with wet paper while watching annie or something. then i tried to take a bath by myself, but whilst getting ready he came into the bathroom and threw up so i decided not to.

since then i dont think he did it anymore. barely remember seeing him drinking a beer or anything except on holidays.

since then my parents divorced and i live 50/50 at each home. 

when i turned 16 he started drinking at weekends. i get it, it was fine. should be good just having a beer or a glass of wine. but he doesnt know when to stop.. he passes out, wakes up, drinks, passes out, repeat. remembers nothing the day after and doesnt get hungover somehow.

now im 19 and hes been doing this pretty much every weekend i can remember, unless we have some strong plans. friday to sunday morning.
 
today i got home and we had planned a nice dinner together. walked in to see him drinking and making food. nothing unusual
then i wait and hear nothing, so i walk downstairs and hes eaten his portion and sitting with wine. i grabbed a plate and ate. he didnt say a word and just stared at me eating. grabbed one of my potatoes and put the whole damn thing in his mouth. ??? lmao. thanked for dinner and did my dishes. he said something i couldnt even understand, mumbling about potatoes..

went to get some soda and the kitchen floor was covered in red wine and he was trying to clean it up.. spilled some more trying to walk up the stairs..

ive talkdd to my mum about this and some times he has been annoying when drunk (never violent or doing anything big) like suddenly getting all childish, taking my things, grabbing my arm so hard it hurts and not letting go. suddenly talking down at me and talking about how none of my things are mine because he paid for it all etc. ends up with me yelling and locking my door and him laughing in my face. 
those times ive called my mum and she ordered a taxi so i can go to her. she then gets really angry at him and calls him telling him to not drink when im here. usually ends up with him laughing and hanging up, then maaybe not drinking a weekend and starting again next week...

she also told me last year that he used to drink before i was born too, and that he got violent and she had a deal with the neighbour to contact them when he was being threatening so they could come and help calm him or something. 

mum tells me to let her know when shes drinkig because she doesnt like that im here when hes like that. but most of the time i dont tell her because she gets worried and tries to contact my dad to yell at him, then he gets angry at me for telling his ex wife. 
so usually i just stay in my room, lock my door if hes annoying, and check on him when hes passed out so he doesnt fall asleep in a position where he can choke.

earlier this year my uncle came by and talkdd to my dad about their dad. turns out he was a narcissist. my dad talked about it to me after. his dad died before i was born so i didnt know him. but ive always felt that dad and my uncle are very.. unemotional? and weird. so learning this made sense. apparenrly grandpa treated my dad the worst and favored his brother. my grandma is my only living grandparent today, and shes been very good and helped raise me. but shes.. pretty special emotionally and has had troubles with eating and used to harass me and my siblings for our weight.

so idk. im glad he opened up to me about that. he told me himself that he didnt think much of it since it was so long ago, and that it probably has affected how he is alot. i felt that brought us closer since he isnt very.. open about feelings and such.

andddd well.. two months ago my dads coworker and closest thing to a friend there, and outside work really - he hasnt had friends since i was a kid afaik - killed himself. my dad had to talk to the family since he knew him the last months best and it was a very sad situation. ive told him i care about and love him and that im there for him and that he can talk to me about this. he seems like usual but ive been checking on him and worrying a bit.

annndddd the other day he went to the doctor and he has a sick leave for 1 month up to 12 months because of an injury from work, and its hard physical work.
hes just been laying on the couch every day watching tv, and being on his computer.

he doesnt have any hobbies besides his motorcycle, but its winter here now so he cant until april or so again. i asked what hes gonna do now that hes gonna be home all te time and he said hes gonna try to read books, which is nice.

so now im worried. he has no friends, and no hobbies, and now hes gonna be home 24/7. ive asked him begore if hes lonely, but he says hes fine and hes always been a lone wolf so i get it. but i cant help but worry. i hope he doesnt start drinking more. or that hes gonna get depressed.

not sure what i want with this post but i needed to share. i have a therapist and ive mentioned this several times but it doesnt seem to be a «big deal». 

is there any way i can help him? when hes drunk i always check on him to see he doesnt choke or anything. 
but is there more?? i feel so worried and im alone, i cant go to my mum because shes out of town for some days.


thanks.

"Who cares? I’ve been an alcoholic for nearly 15 years (34 M). It began when I worked at a Mexican restaurant and had unlimited access to Margaritas during my shift. I got fired from that job, but that was nearly 15 years ago.

Fast forward through many drunken years of college and I’m now a “high functioning” alcoholic with a good career and two master’s degrees. But I still drink every day.

Last Friday I had 16 drinks (didn’t want to stop), then took two days off and now I’m back at it. I usually have 4 drinks a day, and I’m a big guy (6’4”, 260), so it doesn’t affect me too much. 

Only my grandma seems to know and has told me I’m an alcoholic to my face. This is the same grandma who supplies us with unlimited booze when we come over. Her husband, my grandpa, is an 80 year old alcoholic with great health.

My partner loves to drink too. Other than my grandma, no one seems to notice or care. I get good feedback at my job, I pay my bills, and I even give to charity.

"Virginia Stimulant Prescriptions Now Require Drug Testing? Hello, I've been taking adderall XR 10mg for about two years now, and I was told last from my primary care physician that Virginia changed their legislation to require drug tests for each monthly prescription. I am a ""nightly"" smoker who marijuana to ease the come-down and help me sleep and to counteract the anxiety that I get as a result of the side-effects of adderall. 

Randomly, I was drug tested last time I went in for a refill, but my doctor said since I was honest and told my her in advance that I'm a smoker and I would fail, she was forced to switch me to Vyvanse.  However, she warned me if i fail the drug test next time, I'll lose my prescriptions forever. I really can't afford to go off medication now, as i'm in the middle of an insanely difficult semester and my ADHD-PI is a nightmare for anything in academia. I looked online and didn't see anything about a legislation change regarding this.

I can start detoxing now and pass this next test, and in theory I could just get clean every 3 months that I go for a refill.. But, I don't like having to be dishonest with my doctor so I would like to see if this is may just be an office policy. Would this be the same across all doctors? Should I go get a prescription from a psychiatrist instead of a physician? 

Is there anyone else here in Virginia with a prescription that has refilled recently that can chime in?

"New to this sub and have some ??s Hi everyone. This is my first post and I have some questions.
My son is 9 and has ADHD inattentive type.
We made the decision we are going to move forward with meds because things have exploded in school since before the holidays.
We saw his doctor today after a meeting with the school, who recommended Concerta to trial beginning this weekend.
I've spoken to a colleague who has a child on this, who also works in the field with patients on this drug and she highly recommended too.
I went to the pharmacy on my way home from work however, and they said the cost for 30 pills even with my insurance is over $200 a month.
Is there a generic version that is typically cheaper?
The pharmacy was no help because they were super busy.
It was a long day so my mind is also kind of a blur of others she said as an alternative.
I plan to call the doctor in the AM so want to be prepared.

His issues really are that he is one of the highest achievers in his grade, is in a special STEM (formerly gifted and talented) program but recently starting to refuse/is unable to focus to do work. They are worried if this doesn't get addressed he will get kicked out of STEM which cannot happen.
His frustration is also escalating and he has started to have tantrums in school.

We are also requesting accommodations in the classroom.

My main concern is the meds though.

I will suck it up and pay it if there is no good alternative.

ETA: we also drop him off at 7am and don't pick him up from his after school program until 5 or 6 and sometimes later if there's a special event. How does this work with needing multiple doses? School nurse? My colleague said it initially worked with one of the meds her child tried because challenging classes were in earlier part of day before meds wore off. This was before switching to Concerta.

"The Unfortunate Reminders From what I've gathered here, I'm sure others here can relate without me going into a whole spiel about who I am and what my deal is. I guess I just want to vent for a second about a bit my current point in life.

My husband is abusing me. Just in the past 6 months he has drop three bomb shells on our lives that have made life hell. As of this year he's accidentally given me HIV, admitted to using meth, and just last night he was apparently place on suspension at work pending certain termination.

We live with his parents, and frankly it difficult for me to grapple with magnitude of social incompetence that allowed me to marry him in the first place. I'm treated like a child and the my daily experience in college classes show me how much potential value is more or less trapped inside this flawed interface of a personality.

It seems like no level of reflection or self awareness is able to turn off the constant noise in my head, violently churning my unpleasant reality over and over and over and over and over and over and over. I honestly just want to go to sleep, but my brain just can't stop the illogical feed of fear and anxiety. Is student debt worth it there is a chance I still won't be able to hold down a job? Will ever truly fix my co-dependence or will I inevitably be drawn to another person who could/would manipulate me? I don't know.

Thing is though is that I'm not depressed about it. Not going to kill myself over it or anything like that, it just sort of feels like a poorly designed puzzle that wasn't meant for me. When I cry or get emotional it's more of a overwhelming feeling than anything else. How am I supposed to process all this information while at the same time satisfying any kind of normalcy of being married, going to school, having hobbies, having friends, etc. 

At some point I feel like I gained the tools to articulate how I feel about many things in my life, but all the clarity in the world still doesn't yield this mythic connection that I've seem to be missing from the people closest to me. Everyone around me seems jaded and miserable, and for some reason I have a compulsion to empathize. Or at least have an intense feeling that I assume is empathy /s. (That's supposed to be a reference at how people with Asperger's tend to not show empathy, though I don't know how accurate are dated that is to say.)

I'm like six paragraphs in and I don't even know what the point of writing any of this is. I think I'm just in the mood to say something in the hopes that I might resonate with someone else out there. Just externalizing the noise that's inside my head and attempting to put it into something constructive or indicative of my current mental state. And that even while I hate the contraints of language so much.

I don't know if this is the right place for this sort of thing, or if  I sound fever-induced. Lol. But either way whatever it was I guess it's certainly written now. 

I believe they call it a stream of consciousness.

TL;DR

They're also putting in new sewage lines. My entire house, windows, pots, pans, dishes, plates, everything, fucking everything has been shaking constantly from the time I come home from work (around 2pm) until at least 6pm.

No amount of headphones, earplugs, blankets, moving to a different room, nothing will stop this deluge of a racket and I know there's nothing I can do about it. Compound that with the fact that work is pretty noisy too so I have zero escape and it's making it really really hard to not freak out.

"Thoughts about drinking meal replacement drinks while taking adderall? I have recently been prescribed Adderall XR 20mg for ADHD. I already had a poor appetite before I started the medication, so the adderall only makes it a little worse. I have to make myself eat once I realize I have gone too long without eating. I work night shift and 12 hour shifts so it’s hard to have a decent diet anyway. 

I have no problem drinking fluids, so I was wondering if I should start trying out meal replacement drinks that have protein and vitamins and such. The medication has really been helping me, so I don’t want to have to stop taking it because of this. Anyone have any advice? Will this symptom eventually go away? ",adhd,adhd
"I know a person who keeps messing up and does not seem to be taking this seriously. How do I tolerate her? So I know I’m judging; that’s not my question. My question is, how do I put up with this and pretend to take her seriously and respect her when I don’t? I take recovery seriously. I am recovering from addiction myself... not alcohol, but it’s all the same really. I also take accountability seriously and she doesn’t, and I don’t like that energy around me at this time in my life. I don’t need it. 

But I guess the question is... how would YOU feel about this?

This acquaintance has ample resources and money and support and has still fucked up a lot. To give you an idea, she has endangered her kids due to her drinking and is standing to lose a lot right now. 

She has done treatment and meetings, but just seems to go through the motions and isn’t making any progress. Why do I say that? Well, with EVERYTHING that is happening, she relapsed AGAIN (she can’t seem to go for longer than a month now) and this time GOT A FREAKING DUI. 

She doesn’t seem to realize the gravity of her situation. She is just trying to make it go away and get away with it somehow, and carry on with “recovery”

Now it’s her life ultimately, but I really find her situation sad and don’t think she is going to be OK. 

Unfortunately I see her a lot (long story), so I have to pretend to be friendly and civil, when in reality I find her pathetic and sad. I think she is a joke. I hope she will be OK, but given her recent track record, I wouldn’t bet on her. This basically sucks for her and the people close to her. I want to improve my life and surround myself with others who are plugged in and really trying. I can see that she is NOT.

"Concerta and $$$ Right now I pay about $230 for 30 pills with insurance.  Generic is $245 and insurance won’t cover it.

So pills are a M-F thing and weekends are what they are.  Special occasions only, I.e recent Bat Mitzvah and sitting in a temple for two hours with the entire thing in Hebrew would be pill-worthy.

I’m thinking of trying alternatives, but hesitant because this stuff works.  Thinking through how to try alternatives, maybe on Fridays go without and try other non-med techniques.  Or try mixing in a different less expensive pill on fridays and track how that goes (although not sure doctor would give me script for two different meds as they only want to dole out 30 pills at a time)

"Books/Researched Methods on managing ADD without medication? (Sorry if I'm being redundant or breaking any rules; I'm new to actually posting on reddit) I was diagnosed with ADD a long time ago, which was partly awesome because at the time I was incapable of functioning in class, struggling super hard with doing homework, and put in classes for kids who need extra help speaking English even though I read books beyond my level. Ever since I started taking vyvanse, my life stopped being a guilty hell for me, I also probably wouldn't have gotten good enough grades to get into college because the hardest thing is studying at home or doing homework without medication. If I don't enjoy something, I really just can't seem to get it done without vyvanse. Recently, I've been halving my dosage(I used to take full doses every day except weekends and holidays) and I'm trying to take less and less, mostly because the crashes and negative mood/sleep effects are taking too much place in my life. I even tried Modafinil, but it seems like without stimulating an emotional drive the meds just make me feel a little jumpy. I think there is nothing wrong or shameful in taking meds--people who do think this are generally the hardest factor in being ADD/ADHD for me--but taking vyvanse as long as I have at a dosage so high can lead to some pretty bad heart problems, and the crashes just suck. They make it hard to have fun and communicate with the people I love. It's even harder when the kind of work I'm doing is later in the evening, and/or necessitates creativity. I'm working on getting a reevaluation done and maybe some bloodwork/heart exam to see where I'm at biologically, and I might try switching meds around more, but overall I would love to know if there's any effective cognitive behavioral therapy guides specifically geared towards people like me, because with my insurance it seems getting a therapist might prove difficult. I've poked around before at stuff, I really like M.D. Burns' ""Feeling Good"" but this is not related to ADD and the sort of things I've seen actually relevant seem to just boil it down to ""Exercise! Sleep more!! Love urself :D!"" TL;DR: Know any good self-applied therapeutic methods/literature for dealing with really intense ADD? thx guys",adhd,adhd
"Experiences finding a counsellor/therapist Hi r/PTSD. I am new to this thread and wanted to share a recent experience and ask for your support. 

I experienced a significant trauma 2 years ago which involved a health care provider. I was left physically damaged and required surgical repair. Since then, I have suffered from psychological symptoms, which have been debilitating at times. I have sought support from counsellors paid for by my employer, but they have been terrible. I was forced to see a new one and had my second meeting with her a few days ago. I hadn't discussed my trauma in our first session as I wanted to get to know her a bit first, but before our second session I had suffered a psychological setback and needed someone to talk to. She really pushed for hypnosis. I refused. Then she encouraged me to tell her about my trauma despite my obvious discomfort in giving her details. When I did, she made me repeat myself over again because she wasn't listening. At one point, she suggested I seek out faith healing at a local church, despite my telling her about spiritual abuse I had suffered through an ex-partner. I will never go back to see this counsellor and am left wondering what is the point? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Counsellor wanted to hypnotize me, suggested ""faith healing""

"I’m not sure if the guy I’m talking to may have ASD... We have not met in person yet, so I’m not sure what to think.

But when we talk through texts...he texts me a lot and I can tell he wants to talk to me a lot, but he never asks questions about me. He just answers whatever I ask with a very simple, hard to respond to answer. Sometimes it leaves me thinking he may not want to talk to me, but when I don’t answer he’ll text again.

This is leaving me feeling very confused. It’s very hard to have a conversation with him. 

Otherwise we seem to have a lot in common and would have a lot to talk about if he asked me questions. He also works with adults with ASD which leads me to believe he is a caring person. 

Is this something that would be common with someone who has ASD? (It would be a relief to know it was ASD and not that he just doesn’t care what I have to say. Hahaha)

"Nightmares that meds dont seem to help Its really weird before PTSD I used to never dream (or never remember them, if you believe everyone dreams).  I would have maybe 1 or 2 dreams a year.  Now pretty much every night is some form of a nightmare.  Some are violent, some are just shitty like putting my dog to sleep, naked in school, that kind of thing.  During shitty times I'll wake up 3 to 4 times a night.

I'm starting to give up and think it will just be like this forever which is a depressing thought.  Im just tired of being tired.

For those that prazosin helped (since I keep hearing great stories of it working).  Did you tend to wake up paniced and moving around?  Most of mine I just wake up calm and remembering a shitty dream, my hearts not pounding, no adrenaline, so maybe thats why it doesn't work for me.

"Am I faking? or how to stop eating so much TW: body image issues, eating issues??  


I sometimes feel like I have issues with eating. Like, maybe, my eating habits are disordered. But then again, I'm a fat cow and I think I'm just faking for attention. I'm 165cm and I weigh around 66kg (which is around 5'5"" and 145lbs). My BMI is VERY close to 25 which would be officially considered overweight. I really wanna lose weight before reaching that limit. My problem is that I will commit to my goal (UGW being 49 kg) for a day or two and then I'll start feeling so bad and so sorry for myself that I'll start binging. I'm already pretty depressed as is and it so happens that food is the rare source of happiness for me therefore I tend to turn to it when I feel down. However I don't care much about my health, I just wanna get skinnier. Being healthy is not gonna make me happier, being skinnier will.

Finished a TV binge? Great, I get my life back... to frantically start Googling for a new thing to watch. Bored of that? Awesome, I'm over it... and sucked into hyperfocusing on chicken keeping for a month. Run out of new info to read? Hurrah, I can work a full day again... right after I browse through this random Wikipedia entry and spend several hours reading up on this new topic.

It never stops. I had an awesome run at work for a couple of years where everything was new and interesting and I was fooled into thinking I could be a super productive human being, but now I'm bored and I can't... stop craving new things. Stuff I used to love doing is now rote and I'd rather watch an old Disney movie for the 7th time just to give my brain a break from the stress of focusing on something it doesn't want to do.

I hate it. It's an addiction cycle in the purest sense, and there's no rehab for 'finding stuff interesting', no way to cope with  boredom/rejection/failure feeling like withdrawal. I cycle between super focused and happy and in massive avoidance and depression mode, and the less interesting work gets, the more I avoid it. I'm considering jumping to a new job, to start the cycle over, even though I know this job is probably the best one for me I'm likely to find. But I can't really go to my manager and go 'bored now, assign me a totally different bunch of stuff and figure out how to cover my previous tasks pls or I just will stop working'.

"Look who's planning (way) in advance, for once! (Questions about being a functional human without meds) Hello all! I'm (23F) recently married, and while we aren't planning on having kids right now, it is part of our plan. I've been taking medications (Vyvanse and Focalin, now Concerta and Ritalin) nearly every single day since I was 16. Out of curiosity, I was researching ADD meds and pregnancy, and while there were varying answers, most of the research ranged from ""dangerous"" to ""not recommended,"" so if possible, I'd like to avoid taking medication while pregnant and breastfeeding. (Of course, when I do eventually get pregnant, I'll speak to a doctor!)  
  
I'm concerned (and my husband has expressed concern) about who I'll become when I'm not on meds. On the few days when I don't take anything, I stay in bed all day, I don't take out the dog, and I eat like a pig. I *hate* myself like that, and I can't imagine *being* that for 9 months + breastfeeding.  
  
I was mostly wondering if you guys had any tips for something I could start doing now to make that transition easier. Like if there's some sort of ADD-friendly structure I could start implementing into my life now so that when I do eventually get off meds, I don't find myself becoming an unlovable blob. ",adhd,adhd

"Bad experience at check-up today So this is more of just a rant/vent. I (22F) had a strange experience today at the doctor's. It should have been just a normal check-up/refill visit but my heart rate was really high today. My PCP even did a EKG and manual heart rate (I'm normally in the higher range of normal, but I was 140 today). She mentioned having me go see a cardiologist before allowing me back on stimulants (15 Adderall) and started asking me some pretty normal questions about how do I feel normally during the day and such. I don't know why but the questions (along with the extra tests/checks we just did) just made me super nervous, like I was panicking, and couldn't awnser any of the questions. I was just freaking out. My doctor noticed and had us stop the appointment there, and suggested I just come back in a week, to have time to calm down and make mental notes of how my heart feels during different activities. I don't know why I got so flustered/freaked out, and now I'm kind of worried I caused new issues about me for my doctor to be concerned about. I started crying in the room after she walked out. I'm really afraid of being taken off my medication, I won't be able accomplish anything without it, and I know this doctor isn't a huge fan of me being on it to begin with. I'm really hoping this was just a fluke/bad day (I was dehydrated, did bad on a econ exam, and had some bad childhood memories brought back up right before the appointment, which probably caused the unusual anxiety and heart rate). I've been home for a few hours now, my HR is in a more normal range now (upper 80s), though my chest still feels like it's flustering and I'm still upset/embarrassed/idk about how today went. Hopefully tomorrow/next week will be a fresh start, I'll be back to normal, and everything that happened today will be forgotten about....",adhd,adhd

So, I was diagnosed as a kid in the 90s and my parents didn’t take it seriously (thanks guys, they’re still great parents otherwise though!) which is why when I had a lot of struggles in university I at least had an idea of what might have been wrong with me. At the time they started me on Biphentin it never really worked so they put me on Adderall, and for a while it seemed to work (well, work is a strong word, let’s just say it improved my life slightly) but now I’m not so sure it’s working anymore? It’s effectiveness has seem to wear off to the point that sometimes ill forget to actually take the medicine.

"How do you handle insomnia from IR Amphetamine Salts? For the past few months, I've been trying to find ADHD medication that works for me. Started on Vyvanse 10mg, which (surprise, surprise!) did nothing for me. Last month, I was moved to 30mg Vyvanse and 10mg IR Adderall, or the 10mg Amphetamine salt tablets. Neither are strong enough to make much of an impact, but the IR Adderall is slightly more effective. (Not sure if because I just notice the difference faster because its processed more quickly). 

My work schedule is all over the place, so I dont take my medication at consistent times because I dont want to have it wear off mid shift. However, taking it 2 or later leaves me awake till 1 to 3 am. I only feel the effects however for the first 2 or 3 hours though, so if I take it earlier in the day I'm a mess halfway through my shift. 

How do you handle the insomnia? I've heard guanfacine and atomoxetine can help bring you back down and sleep, but I wanted to ask others' experiences before I see my doctor this week and drop who knows how much on my copays. Are there over the counter medications that work effectively? Any advice or anecdotes would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Can't take my meds too early or they wear off too fast; taking them too late I cant sleep. Advice?

"Guanfacine (Intuniv) Testimonials Needed (Adult ADHD) Hey guys, I was diagnosed with ADHD back when I was 17. Ever since, I’ve been on 10-15 Mg (instant release) Adderall 1-2 times a day. The stimulant is extremely important to me but the side effects (like anxiety/poor sleep quality) are leading me to seek an additional medication to take alongside it. I’ve also been reflecting on my specific debilitations since being diagnosed, and through some digging, Intuniv seems like it might really help me. I am now 24, just graduated college and can confidently experiment with something new without the fear of my grades becoming an issue. Here is how I define my ADHD:

**Main debilitations**

Poor working memory

Poor executive function control (motivation/focus)

Impulsivity (mainly emotional)

Fixation issues (Love interests, new hobbies)

Poor reading comprehension (full paragraphs read, nothing retained)

Poor organization 

Lackluster concept of time (always late)


I’m making this post to hear from adults who have experience with intuniv (Guanfacine). From what I’ve read, some people notice a complete change in their ability to manage their working memory and see great improvements to their executive functions. I am seeing a psychiatrist in the morning and may be starting this medication soon after. What are your experiences taking this medication? Adult testimonials only please. 17+ ",adhd,adhd

I've had some very not so classy moments. Like pissing the bed. Or just being emotional.

But yeah, I split with my ex and now I can't sleep without drinking. Or feel okay about being by myself at night without being drunk.

"Food and S.O.’s This isn’t as much a rant I guess but a vent. I’ve never been diagnosed with an ED or considered myself having one so I’m sorry if I’m not supposed to post here but I feel like no one IRL will really understand me.

I’ve always had a bad relationship with food and my weight would constantly fluctuate. When I was younger my family would always comment on how chubby I was. My mom would flat out tell me I can’t wear certain things. Once I started dating, my boyfriends would always try to get me to lose weight. My ex got me down to 145 when I was in high school. Once I went to college I gained hella weight and shot up to 175 and I was extremely self conscious about how I looked. I started dating my current boyfriend and he made me feel okay with my weight and he eventually encouraged me to lose weight as I had a high BMI and  I currently weigh around 155 which I’m pretty sure is a normal BMI for me.

My boyfriend is the sweetest and I know he loves me so much but I don’t think he really understands my relationship with food and bushes it off as I’m not trying hard enough. He gives me ultimatums that stress me out and I don’t know it really hurts. This is the only thing he’s ever asked me to do for him and I keep letting him down. 

I feel like I try so hard for him though and he doesn’t see it that way. For a month I was only eating 2 protein bars a day and going to the gym for hours. Then I gained all the weight back beacuse I had a cheat meal and I just took a downward spiral into food again.

I guess I made this post today beacuse what he said hit me extra hard today. I’m on Christmas break with my family right now, but I’m supposed to be on vacation with him. Last minute my mom threw a fit about it so I couldn’t spend time with him. I just moved in to a different state, and he messaged me if I don’t lose 10 lbs by the time I get back we’re breaking up and I need to move out beacuse he doesn’t want to be with a failure. I basically can’t eat, which I can’t even do because I’ll be with my parents 24/7 so I’m basically fucked. I get that’s he’s frustrated beacuse he’s been wanting me to lose weight the past year and a half and I haven’t, but it’s also not beacuse I’m not trying. He literally doesn’t understand what I go though and I feel like whenever I try to tell him, I don’t even get to explain myself fully beacuse he chocks it up to me making excuses. 

Every day he mentions that fact that I need to lose weight and I just got a bad haircut too recently (lmao rip me) so he comments on that as well. And a lot of the time he tells me he’s joking but I feel like even the jokes get to me. It just sucks.

"I can’t always be the one that’s wrong, right? Every time we get into a fight, my boyfriend gets really mad and tells me that when I get upset, my memory goes to shit. He says I twist things and exaggerate and make things up to fit the version of the story that I want, to help me win the argument and make him think he is wrong. He says he doesn’t think I do it intentionally, but the fact that I do it at all is unsettling and the biggest flaw about me. It’s the one thing preventing him from seeing a future with me. 

My boyfriend has drank heavily every day for the past 4-5 years. There was a period of time when he would black out around 3 days a week, if not more.

Is memory impairment like what he accuses me of a symptom of alcoholism? There’s no way I’m always wrong, right? There’s no way my memory is always the one that fails? Does prolonged alcohol abuse do this to a person and affect them when they are sober as well?

I’m not saying my memory is infallible. I know I must be wrong at least some of the time. Maybe even most of the time. But it can’t be all the time. Or maybe it can? He’s actually cut back on his drinking a lot in the past couple months. I can’t remember when the last time he’s blacked out is, and he actually goes a day or two without drinking at all sometimes. But it seems like in that time, his temper has gotten worse. When he gets mad, he seems to hold so much contempt for me. He’s actually said before (while mad) that he doesn’t/can’t give a shit about my feelings in the moment because he’s so mad at me. 

I know I’ve been a lot to deal with in the past, and I’ve put him through a lot too. I can’t help but feel like I did this to him. Maybe I did with my period of emotional instability. I know I have faults too, and I know I must contribute to our problems too. 

I have very clear memories of certain things that happened while we were fighting or he was mad. I have clear memories of him screaming at me and saying certain hurtful things and reacting in certain ways. And again, I’m not saying I’m never mistaken or that my memory is perfect. But there’s no way I’m misremembering every single thing that I think happened. There’s no way every fight is my fault, is there? I mean he also has very clear memories of what happened, and he’s not always drunk anymore when we fight. So maybe he’s right and I’m just crazy and manipulative and I need some intense therapy to help with my memory when I’m feeling emotional. But please someone tell me alcohol abuse can do this to a person. Because if not, I have to come to terms with the fact that I may be quite literally crazy. And I really don’t think that I am, but I’m really doubting myself.",alcoholism,alcoholism

Fully accept and embrace that you have ADHD (I had trouble with this and denied for many years the fact I wasn't ""normal"").  The sooner you stop resisting and denying reality, the sooner you will heal.  Your life gets better after you accept it, not worse.

2. Realize that having ADHD is not your fault.  You had no control over the way you were born.

3. Read all of the articles on ADDitudemag.com.  I find this site incredibly useful, easy-to-read, and with high-quality information (editors with PhDs).  There is so much to learn.  The knowledge you will gain from this site will soothe you and give you the tools to live your best life.

"You ARE normal! I lurk this sub pretty frequently, however I never really post anymore... but I just wanted to pipe up and say that I’m loving all of the selfies everybody is posting. The thought that there are so many average people that suffer with this just makes me think that maybe I’m not some freak to everyone else, and that I’m pretty normal too. It’s so awesome to see such a variety of people and knowing that any random person I see on the street could be schizophrenic too makes me feel a bit less alone. Keep on being awesome everybody and spread the love around!! 💪🏻😃🤙🏻",schizophrenia,schizophrenia
