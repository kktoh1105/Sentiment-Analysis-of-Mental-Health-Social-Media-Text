README
This directory contains all files related to my final year project experiments. Below is an explanation of the folder structure and the contents:

üìÅ Dataset1-3 Folder
Inside each Dataset folder (Dataset 1-3), there are 9 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files, categorized into two types:

1. Model Training Notebooks
These notebooks are labeled with the format:
Model Name (Model Training)

They contain the code used to train the respective models.
Note:
The file D1.ML.ipynb includes training code for four traditional machine learning models.

2. Prediction CSV Generation Notebooks
These notebooks are labeled with the format:
Model Name (Generate Prediction CSV)

They are used to train and load the trained models and generate prediction results, which are then saved into a .csv file.
Each resulting CSV file contains:

The input text
The true label
The predicted label by the model

üìÑ CSV Output Files
There are 3 prediction result CSV files included in the folder. These are the prediction outputs from the following models:Extra Trees Classifier,CNN-BiLSTM,BERT
